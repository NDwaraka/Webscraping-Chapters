  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 98
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even now when he believes he’s alone, he can’t stand it like this, so imagine if Ja Hyeong-woo appeared and confessed the truth about those wet dreams to Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He might really try to die or never look at Ja Hyeong-woo’s face again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was bitten on the foot again. In the end, once more, he couldn’t bring himself to talk about the treatment. Ja Hyeong-woo quietly activated his return skill like a thief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in the midst of this, he found himself ridiculous for getting excited. But Gang-hyeon’s flustered reaction was so fresh, stimulating in another sense, and brought along other unknown emotions too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kind that made him want to hug him tightly and rub their faces together, or bite his cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because of this, I have to take responsibility for Gang-hyeon. I might have to take responsibility for his whole life… That would be nice.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He left one request with his mouse familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Gang-hyeon has bad thoughts, stop him. And let me know.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He took Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s casual words seriously and left with a piece of worry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had a dream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you want to show sincerity in your apology, don’t push me away.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A familiar voice said words from his memory. Whose words were those again…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The face and build in front of him were also familiar. Ja Hyeong-woo had definitely said that and then came over to embrace him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh…? But Ja Hyeong-woo’s hwarang outfit wasn’t visible. He was shirtless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His bronzed naked body was so large it covered even the background in the corners of his vision. No matter where he looked, muscles filled his entire field of view.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is strange, this is strange… Though he could only think hazily, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body wouldn’t move. Ja Hyeong-woo kept getting closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, Ja Hyeong-woo hugged him tightly, and their two bodies pressed together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Aaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He got up from his spot so hurriedly that his head spun. Gyeon Gang-hyeon forgot his dizziness and quickly lifted the blanket that was lightly covering him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He prayed it wouldn’t be the case, but underneath was inevitably a mess from traces of his dream. It was even sticky since it hadn’t been long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He shuddered with the exact feeling of wanting to die. He pressed his forehead while keeping his lower body stiffly rigid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wet dreams themselves weren’t unfamiliar. Since he never took care of things himself, he occasionally dealt with this annoying situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But usually I don’t dream anything…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The target was so shocking that the fact that it was another man had become relatively unremarkable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was a nightmare among nightmares. He was so ashamed that if he squeezed hard enough, he felt like he could really shed a tear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bad luck had struck. This was a great misfortune. Gyeon Gang-hyeon put the blanket and clothes into the washing machine with a devastated face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The day after tomorrow is when we go to meet the American hunters, and what is this…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He belatedly exploded with worry about whether the familiars had seen, but for some reason, everything was quiet on that front. At least that was fortunate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We teleport to the American dimensional space in 20 minutes. Get ready.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s instruction to the overseas expedition team gathered here could be heard, but that wasn’t what was important to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s because I was desperately trying not to make eye contact with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, since it was something I always did normally, it probably wouldn’t show. Believing that, I stood only in directions that had my back to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho came over and put his arm around my shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you do something wrong to Ja Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, dark-tanned skin color filled my head completely. Agh!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why, why…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t looking at you today particularly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not me, but Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing Sa Ye-ho’s words, I suddenly felt creepy. Could it be that Ja Hyeong-woo knows the content of my dream…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …How would he know that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know the saying about getting slapped in Jongno and taking it out on the Han River, but I got angry at Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s it to you? Are you already worried I’ll go to the competition and become an international embarrassment!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah fuck, look at this puppy’s temper. This is a Pomeranian.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was about to get annoyed together but soon gave a hollow laugh. He roughly tousled my hair and got down from his tiptoes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The friendly competition consisted of a 5-day expedition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Day 1: Opening ceremony (joint meal for both teams), matches 1-3
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Day 2: Match 4
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Day 3: Matches 5, 6
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Day 4: Match 7 overtime (if victory isn’t decided in match 6)
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Matches 1-3 were death matches that ended quickly without stamina consumption, and matches 4-6 were capture battles where you could keep reviving within the round even if eliminated. The schedule was arranged considering the match content.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, the schedule changed depending on how the matches went. If one side achieved an overwhelming victory, we might return home early.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then naturally, our goal is—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s finish it on the second day, right? The goal is to only go up to match 4!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No. That’s only Ma Cheon-ah’s thinking. No one else is thinking of a complete victory like Ma Cheon-ah. The American kids aren’t idiots either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good spirit! At minimum, we’ve got the final victory secured.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho loudly hinted from afar that we might lose a round or two, but Ma Cheon-ah didn’t listen to others. Enthusiasm blazed from her warrior outfit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then I can’t help but pour cold water on this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I interjected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re saying we should go 4 wins and 0 losses? We play four matches and win all four?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aren’t you confident?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gaze that said incompetent bastards were disgusting to look at shot out like fire, snap snap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then can you cover for my holes and play? Are you going to carry me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, unfortunately, I was the biggest obstacle in Ma Cheon-ah’s life. In two areas, we were exactly opposite to each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, since the matches were organized as PvP battles rather than monster-killing raids, I was a serious flaw in the team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Second, unlike Ma Cheon-ah who was completely wrapped up in arrogance and conceit, I knew my place well. I also had a good grasp of what was possible for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Damn, why did you even come?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah walked over briskly and brought her irritated face a little closer. I confidently looked up at her eyes, which were about 2cm above me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “America called so I came.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “These despicable bastards! They called ‘this thing’ to the enemy team because they want to win easily? They want a free meal?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …We’re not in America yet, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, since we hadn’t moved yet, there was no awkward situation with officials.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s blatant criticism poked at my temples. Sa Ye-ho giggled next to Woo Sae-geon, and Woo Sae-geon had no interest in me. Ja Hyeong-woo… let’s see if I look at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whether there’s a dog on the team or not! We’re the strongest successors in Korea. Unless America sends out their rankings 1 and 3, shouldn’t we go 4 wins and 0 losses?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, you know I’m Korea’s 3rd rank? Though it’s just skill-dependent.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut up!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She won’t bend her will even like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She absolutely insists we must win all 4 matches in a row. Ma Cheon-ah is serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the friendly competition I saw in the original work, none other than Ma Cheon-ah becomes a major risk factor for the Korean team. Because of that very belligerent and unsteady personality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after achieving 3 consecutive victories, her mental state gets completely shaken by one defeat, and from then on she continuously creates anxiety for the team. They barely manage to win in the end, but she becomes completely out of it…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I just leave it alone, she’d actually taste the bitterness of the world from this incident and naturally become an adult.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But right now there’s the serious troll that is me, and Ma Cheon-ah’s ups and downs are added on top of that, so we might actually end up losing in the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, since it was a friendly competition, no one’s life would be in danger if we lost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strictly speaking, it has no value compared to gates or stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We return to the main school on the 3rd day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The leader who had been keeping his mouth shut suddenly spoke to everyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Day 3 would be under the premise that we progressed to match 5 or 6.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a more realistic match situation than Ma Cheon-ah’s, but it was also a statement declaring he wouldn’t let it go to overtime either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho has this crazy habit of grinning whenever Woo Sae-geon opens his mouth. He hopped down from the railing he’d been sitting on to match Woo Sae-geon’s eye level and smiled wickedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “4 to 1? Or 4 to 2?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon didn’t particularly respond. Even so, I think I know the answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the person who seems least likely to play along with such games doesn’t suggest opinions like deliberately losing all 4 matches to end the competition as quickly as possible. He’s not considering the case where we’re the 2 in a 4:2 at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then I can’t lose either?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s slightly more hateful than losing to Ja Hyeong-woo, I’ll find a way to counter it even if I have to recall all of the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then first, what should I do about Ma Cheon-ah?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced at Ma Cheon-ah, who was swinging her sword around energetically, perhaps because she was young and full of energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I break that overflowing enthusiasm a little, she’d actually play more coolly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I can’t crush her spirit with criticism or anything. Most importantly, even if I said such things, they wouldn’t work on Ma Cheon-ah at all…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After pondering, I threw out another half-serious, half-joking suggestion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ma Cheon-ah, want to make a bet with me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I used this well before in gate practice. Will it work a second time?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah immediately frowned, perhaps having developed trauma since the so-called ‘Cheon-a noona incident.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, she was an incorrigible betting addict, so she seemed to become slightly interested in the end. She gestured at me once with a look that said she’d at least hear what I had to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s bet on the score.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as she heard my story, Ma Cheon-ah poured out objections.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You want me to go 4 wins 0 losses, and you’re trying to go 6 matches with 4 wins 2 losses, right? Don’t be ridiculous. You could play terribly on purpose and lose intentionally, couldn’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She does have some sense though?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grinned and pretended I hadn’t been caught in my scheme. Ma Cheon-ah’s eyes narrowed further as she stared intently at my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, with those words just now, I planted a realistic perception in Ma Cheon-ah that a 4:0 victory had lower probability than a 4:2 victory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Ma Cheon-ah’s guess was wrong. Because I was planning to say the scores in reverse from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, it’s the opposite. I’m betting on us winning 4:0, and you’re betting on us winning 4:2.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s expression became strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before she could refuse while asking what that was, I quickly added the rest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there some punishment you want for me? Try saying it once.”
 </span>
</p>
