 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Korean Hunter Association Headquarters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the only space where successors can wander outside school on stage day without making the news.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We nine entered the spacious room provided by the association. Inside, one person who had already arrived was waiting for us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I led eight people behind me and stood there for a moment, staring blankly at Yoon Sae-geon. Yoon Sae-geon, leaning diagonally against the wall, also looked at us quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When he lived as a scholar, I only ever saw him standing upright in proper posture.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That appearance of standing crookedly wearing a rider jacket also looks natural.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before entering the 11th stage, I suggested we go see Yoon Sae-geon once. But no one voiced any opposition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Whatever they say, in the end there’s a separate spiritual pillar.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone got fired up. After seeing Jangsan Beom trampling on Yoon Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon just stared blankly without saying anything. He no longer had any obligation to give speeches or anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I broke the ice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Honestly…… you think it’s fortunate that you yourself can be left out, don’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon readily admitted it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But those words aren’t sincere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see it too. His frustrated inner feelings flowing out subtly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to recall the power he had lived forgetting, that he had lost. He was thinking he’d rather fight in front than leave it to and entrust those guys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon had already fulfilled his role and stepped back, but even if you do everything perfectly, regrets remain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I would have felt the same in his position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo, don’t you have anything to say?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I poked at the coward who used to tremble just seeing Yoon Sae-geon’s shadow. Yang Pyo, who had been staying quiet, was flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought he’d just fumble around, but Yang Pyo mustered the courage to glance at the gloomy figure over there for a whole 0.3 seconds, then muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Um…… I’m thinking I’d like to arm wrestle right now……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon’s eyebrows went up. Yang Pyo shrank back with a “hiik.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I giggled and patted Yang Pyo’s shoulders firmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, you lost this one. Where are you trying to climb up to?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Geez, hyung told me to say something!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho also smacked Yang Pyo’s back from the other side. With a very happy-looking face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sae-geon hyung would lose to me in arm wrestling right now! Kyahaha.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Have you tried it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, the brief send-off ended. Now it was time to return to the main stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stood at the very front of the passage. I moved forward with light steps, neither slow nor fast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just asking in case…… no one wants to stay behind, right? Yeah, I got it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was something I’d said 50 times by today. And I was ignored all 50 times. Sa Ye-ho even grinned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We only shared with the association the possibility that a final stage might exist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, we didn’t reveal even that to the outside. We also didn’t announce about the stage personnel limit that had increased to maximum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since my approval rating……? had risen after my life history was exposed, the prevailing opinion was that it was fine to announce after clearing the stage first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, we came to the threshold of the 11th stage without worrying about anything else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So it should be full of solemn tension…… When I looked back, I confirmed that Ma Cheon-ah and Sa Ye-ho were stamping their feet and twitching their lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few immature guys were secretly excited. We’d never all nine fought together in one place before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dry and eerie wind greeted us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A grayish-white sky and ground dried and cracked as if in drought. The desolate clearing made an ear-grating wailing sound every time the wind blew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing the legion assembled on the opposite side of the clearing, my breath naturally tightened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were Juk-yeop-gun wearing armor and helmets. Each held a sharp spear and were arrayed so densely there were no gaps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They didn’t charge at us recklessly upon seeing us, but maintained formation. They were like soldiers from ancient times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s war.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether there were thousands or tens of thousands, heads gathered like clouds all the way to the distant horizon where no end was visible. Compared to them, we were far too small and few.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You could stab anywhere and hit something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was the first to voice his impression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I surveyed the frontline soldiers holding large shields. Their information was clearly visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Made of bamboo but wearing armor, so they have the gall to be metal attribute.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since there was the character ‘gun’ (army) in Juk-yeop-gun besides ‘juk-yeop,’ I had this in mind too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Comparing wood attribute and metal attribute, metal attribute is overwhelmingly stronger in combat aspects. Moreover, iron armor. The difficulty increased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The metal energy flowing is bulging like muscles. Each one of those guys is like an elite soldier.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The smallest foot soldier was human-sized. There were also larger Juk-yeop-gun scattered about. Guys wearing more delicate and elaborate armor who I think are commanders like me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That would mean they have intelligence and a command system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t even think about blocking their swords head-on. Don’t think about fighting stylishly with clashing blades either. Just blow them away with attribute power before crossing swords. You know what I mean?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For them it might be war, but for us it should be one-sided extermination. I gave orders with heavy force in my voice. And added one more thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ma Cheon-ah, I’m especially talking to you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I’ve reformed, okay? And you can be cool with attribute attacks too!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What do you mean reformed? You’re still looking for style.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suddenly closed my mouth and glared at the army across from us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Screech! A piercing sound tore at our ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something huge struck down from the sky. A spear as big as my body flew with tremendous vibration toward my nape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clang! The next moment, a deafening roar that made ears ring spread out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The spear couldn’t reach me and bounced away, as if hitting an invisible thick wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……How dare you, to whom.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had stepped forward in front of me, flexed his body muscles and growled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I smiled silently. When I gestured, Yang Pyo stepped aside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If we received a preemptive attack from one of their generals, we should respond in kind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I raised my bow, my team members just watched me. I drew it taut until the string vibrated thinly. My lungs held their breath beneath the arrow shaft, accumulating energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only when the fully drawn string made creaking sounds from the arrow shaft did I carefully aim and release the arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The arrow became faster the longer its flight time. It absorbed the earth’s power and created a whirlwind. Power so dense it made the surroundings hazy like heat shimmer concentrated at the arrowhead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Many Juk-yeop-gun around the arrow’s flight path got caught up and toppled over. A large general energetically raised his sword with good timing. Just as he was about to swing it down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk! The arrow pierced through the large general’s neck. The one who had been displaying majestic dignity knelt in the middle of his own army.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The surrounding Juk-yeop-gun seemed to waver slightly, but quickly returned to quiet calm. Perhaps because there were many commanders. Killing one or two generals didn’t seem to make them falter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Boss, nice shot~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Two out—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re a master archer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho clapped, Ma Cheon-ah whistled sharply. Even Jin Seol-woon chimed in. Though Jin Seol-woon’s voice was quiet, it was heard most clearly due to its unique resonance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a skill shot.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh, are you actually embarrassed?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I told the teasing Sa Ye-ho to shut up via chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I saw another commander raising his bamboo arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A perfectly coordinated atmosphere spread. Spears raised toward the sky swayed uniformly. The shield-bearing soldiers at the very front prepared to charge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I instructed everyone to mount their familiars.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo in front, instead of mounting, overlaid the form of a house-sized mountain goat above himself. I could also see the twelve zodiac animals appearing one by one in my peripheral vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A horse with a fiery mane fluttering. A rabbit full of dense vitality. A blue boar that looked dignified with protruding tusks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A monkey wearing a sword and a viper hissing its tongue threateningly. And above everyone’s heads, a dragon draping its long, winding body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also leaped onto my greatly enlarged dog familiar. Ja Hyeong-woo, who followed and mounted behind me, settled behind my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Juk-yeop-gun commander raised his hand toward us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The silent legion began advancing. All that could be heard were the tremors and footsteps loud enough to shake the entire ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time, I didn’t tell them to stand still and wait for the monsters to come.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Charge.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At my single word, Yang Pyo ran toward the Juk-yeop-gun. Bang—! As soon as they collided, the front part of the army was greatly dented.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately, two swordsmen leaped out to both flanks of the tanker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One side was bright red fire, the other side was pure white blade. Different colored wings spread powerfully.
 </span>
