  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 52
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite being younger, Jin Seol-woon led the joint training session with quiet authority, befitting his status as a senior successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Position-wise, the leader and Myo Cho-hui-ssi won’t have much overlap in movement with that side. Those two will focus on combat as the wings of our formation, while Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi and I will be protecting Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon took a few light steps backward and stood at a distance. Soon, a massive shadow fell across the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From behind him, a huge dragon poked its head out. Jin Seol-woon stroked the horns protruding from the dragon’s head a few times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi is particularly slow-moving and prone to falling, so think of it as relying on the dragon for movement.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t put emphasis on ‘particularly.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dragon familiars boast the absolute highest utility among all familiars. Outstanding in size as a tanker, able to move their long bodies freely while also capable of flight, and being earth-attribute, they can even burrow underground. And above all, they look cool.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since everyone is still inexperienced, the dragon familiar stays on the ground taking on the role of protecting each teammate one by one, but in the latter half of the original story, Jin Seol-woon eventually fights in the sky alongside his dragon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t need it. Hae Mi-jun rode your dragon just fine in actual combat without practice.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun-ssi and Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi are different. And that was an emergency situation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How am I different from Hae Mi-jun?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before Jin Seol-woon could answer, his gaze drifted to around my waist level, and he smiled faintly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your body is different.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is that bastard mocking me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s say a monster attacked Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi. Then I’d see it and do this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon, thicker than my waist, coiled around me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I obediently let my arms and legs go limp and entrusted myself to the dragon. Lifted up by the dragon, I was moved a few steps back. My feet lifted off the ground briefly, then touched down again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your body relaxed well for a first time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You really have zero expectations for my body, don’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, you are weak.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, sharing senses with his dragon familiar, muttered and then approached to examine me more closely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does it hurt?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not too tight?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt cozy and warm somehow. Much more comfortable than Myo Cho-hui’s brutal wooden vines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as the dragon was smoothly unwinding and pulling away, the training ground door opened from outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo walked in confidently, even though this wasn’t his training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get out. This is the earth-attribute training ground.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared at him like looking at a man who’d entered a women’s restroom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo pretended not to hear my words and looked back and forth between Jin Seol-woon and me, the only two in the training ground. He stood closer to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I need to coordinate with you too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did you call him? I glanced at Jin Seol-woon. Jin Seol-woon shook his head no.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought the only thing I needed to agree on with Ja Hyeong-woo beforehand was not picking fights… but apparently there was other work to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Support-type tanker Jin Seol-woon’s dragon familiar usually protected the healer. No matter how good Ja Hyeong-woo’s physical abilities were, he couldn’t maneuver like a tanker or dealer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But with someone even more hopeless than the healer getting involved, Jin Seol-woon now has two people to cover with his dragon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Assuming monsters attacked the center and rear simultaneously, try extracting both me and Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo presented the scenario while looking at Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s gaze traced a line through the air. The dragon writhed and flew over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon smacked my back with its tail, then sent me crashing into the chest of Ja Hyeong-woo, whose eyes were shaking in confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I could even lift my head, the dragon’s body tightly squeezed my waist. I was lifted up while pressed against Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We managed to evacuate from our original positions with minimal movement and time, but my mental state took damage in the process.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My feet didn’t touch the ground immediately. It was because Ja Hyeong-woo was holding me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…If it were truly an emergency situation, it couldn’t be helped, but otherwise, please consider moving us separately.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo spoke quietly in a voice that seemed to be suppressing something. The guy who was usually as calm as lake water was being unusually emotional. He must have really hated it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The culprit, Jin Seol-woon, was stroking his chin with his large hand while staring at us intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having accomplished the goal of moving two people, he should have remained composed even after receiving Ja Hyeong-woo’s criticism. He actually looked that way too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But instead of arguing back, Jin Seol-woon continued to stare while saying:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re right. It looks…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow he was agreeing with Ja Hyeong-woo’s opinion, and then:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…not good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The latter part flowed out after a moment of silence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By then, I had finally succeeded in escaping from Ja Hyeong-woo’s arms. Ja Hyeong-woo left me beside him and suddenly turned his body toward Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why do you say it looks not good? In what sense?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gazes of the two at similar eye level clashed. Jin Seol-woon’s pupils harbored suspicion as they slightly rolled inward under his eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t mean anything by it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I see.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo nitpicking at his teammate? He never did that in the original story. It was strange, so I interjected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey. What context are you picking at his words for? Looking for someone to take your anger out on?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze briefly lingered on me as I sat naturally on the floor resting, then fell away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Sorry. Seol-woon-ah. If my words just now sounded sharp, it was because I was annoyed by Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard knows how to insult people indirectly too? …Was that intentional?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had suggested taking a short break, left the training ground. His retreating figure, donning the black durumagi hanging on the coat rack and swiftly exiting, drew considerable attention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is it really because of me? I wasn’t being annoying just now, was I? Has it gotten to the point where even physical contact with me is irritating?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after the blue trouser hem disappeared, my mental processing lingered at the doorway. Then I realized Jin Seol-woon’s presence and flopped down flat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Looks difficult.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s muttering, without specifying a subject, still managed to get on my nerves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I mouthed ‘mind your own business.’ I was confident Jin Seol-woon had read my lips properly without even looking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, this is why being around Ja Hyeong-woo is awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just now it was fine because it was Jin Seol-woon, but if it had been kids like Hae Mi-jun or Won Ha-ri, I would have been self-conscious from the start. Because of how Ja Hyeong-woo becomes somewhat distant from his usual composure when I’m around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why I’m a bit scared. When the stage footage is released, the public will naturally see us, and I can’t predict how the media will portray the relationship between me and Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Squeaky. You absolutely must not interfere during the stage either. Whether I get hurt or not, don’t step in.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In truly dangerous moments… Ja Hyeong-woo will help me eventually.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Master won’t care about that.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky whispered secretly from Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s right. Ja Hyeong-woo has cut himself off from the internet. He’s not the type to listen to people who aren’t right in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m the one who cares.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Jin Seol-woon probably had plenty of stamina left unlike me, when I rested, he also sat on the bench and spent time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I heard the sound of quiet humming.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t dare hide, 눈을 떠, 바라봐, what you have missed—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He skillfully crafted a song with a unique rhythm, singing without accompaniment while looking at the lyrics on his phone. Soon Jin Seol-woon lifted his head at my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The song cut off at that verse. Jin Seol-woon looked embarrassed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You told me to sing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t say anything. I’m listening.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you listening?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because it’s good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon blinked his eyelashes once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His singing ability really is something. No matter how outstanding his abilities as a hunter, it’s true that his singing talent is too good to waste.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had put down his phone, said we should finish practice if I was done resting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo also returned with an indifferent expression as if nothing had happened. For several days, he kept leaving and returning like that, participating in training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The raid day dawned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  “Ah shit, really. How long are you going to keep saying that? Is your mindset from the Joseon era? It’ll get boring if you keep it up!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s a misunderstanding. I’m not a pervert. I just went to the Hunter School headquarters and told them to confirm my official successor outfit as sobok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Enhancement effects will now be applied to the sobok you wear. Do you approve?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter what anyone says, I’ve decided on sobok as my fixed hunter outfit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I won’t deny the fact that this deathly pale look matches my image…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And white clothes like this show stains well. Whether it’s monster blood or my own blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even though my awakening was late, I need to show off how hard I’m working as a hunter.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned around with my perfect plan in mind, only to find four successors waiting to head to the stage entrance with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Why are they all looking at me like I’m pathetic, except for Jin Seol-woon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was even smiling faintly. No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like he was laughing at me for being ridiculous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud, thud, multiple footsteps were heavily imprinted in the passage leading to the stage entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among them, my footsteps sounded the loudest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Recording begins from the threshold of entering the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Through that recorded footage, I would be fully exposed under people’s gazes. Combat appearance and attitude, bearing, even appearance. Everything would be placed on the evaluation table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I knew better than anyone how much attention the first public combat debut of this piece-of-shit delinquent would attract.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Entering Stage 30.”

  Woo Sae-geon, positioned on my left—the western wing—quietly communicated with the association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since we were solemnly heading into battle, no one spoke lightly. Even I maintained silence, but then a one-on-one chat notification popped up.
