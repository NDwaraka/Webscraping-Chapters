  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 12
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t like the current situation where I can only hope for someone to come help us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Since awakening healed me completely, I’ll work just as hard as a hunter.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone’s thoughts in my voice drift through my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did I really work hard enough? Did I successfully fulfill Cheon Gang-hyeon’s wishes?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monster kept getting closer. I watched it and thought absentmindedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t properly retire—I suddenly lost my abilities. Plus there’s the special nature of my existence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I still have even a little bit of the abilities that ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon’ possessed…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monster in the lead opened its maw toward me, and just as Han Hyeong-woo gritted his teeth and thrust his arm forward as if telling it to eat that instead—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Squeak*, a sound like a small creature’s cry brushed past my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, a semi-transparent dog the size of a medium breed jumped out from behind mine and Han Hyeong-woo’s legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite being much smaller than the monsters, the dog barked bravely and made the monsters retreat slightly. Everyone’s eyes went wide as they stared at the sight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A familiar…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A little later, a small snake also slithered out from Go Ye-ho’s feet, hissing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This shouldn’t be possible. The three of us are no longer successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But why, how.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the sight I thought I’d never see again, my head naturally grew dizzy. Without realizing it, I stroked the mouse on my shoulder with my finger. The blue mouse squeaked and rubbed its head against my finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monsters that had hesitated briefly tried to bare their teeth once more. Around that time, we were all doing the same thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyone’s status window opening?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Not at all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instinctively trying to use skills again, or trying to move our familiars.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come here, will you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The snake showed no particular reaction to Sa Ye-ho’s desperate call. It just flicked its long tongue toward the monsters. Small flames sparked from its tip and flew at the monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog moved the ground slightly to knock over a monster. Looking at the dog’s all-too-familiar appearance made my head dizzy once again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if enchanted, my mouth opened by itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Meong-mung-ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Woof!* The dog barked once as if responding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it didn’t look back at me. It was solely focused on growling and preventing the monsters from approaching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Go Ye-ho and Han Hyeong-woo both whipped around to look at me simultaneously. I had similar thoughts. Could it be?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Baem-baem-ah…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the snake didn’t react to my voice either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I once could control all familiars, the hypothesis that the snake would listen to me was now proven wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, what about the mouse and dog?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind the reason that they’re mine and Han Hyeong-woo’s familiars… there must be a more fundamental reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s probably…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *BANG!* A sudden roar echoed through the area. I looked up in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monsters that had been threatening us just moments before were crushed by a shockwave that struck down from above. Most of them stopped moving, apparently killed by that single blow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I raised my head a little higher, I could see pure white cracks forming overhead. As soon as I saw them, my mouth fell open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small, white crack just big enough for one person to enter. Very familiar. Because until two years ago, I used to travel between Hunter School and Korea with that function.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi, are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The owner of a familiar voice jumped down from inside it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because it had been so long since I’d seen him in person, I felt like I’d lost touch with reality for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Twenty-two-year-old Jin Seol-woon seemed to have a more mature face than before. I was staring at him in a daze when another person suddenly poked their head out from behind Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I took in Hae Mi-jun, who had grown considerably taller, my heart brightened. Hae Mi-jun took big steps forward and hugged me tightly with a bright smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After letting go of Hae Mi-jun, Jin Seol-woon had naturally moved in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I flinched slightly before feeling glad to see him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s become a hugging atmosphere, but Jin Seol-woon is…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he bent his upper body toward me first and hugged my back tightly. Using both arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could feel Han Hyeong-woo’s gaze, but he didn’t seem to have anything particular to say either. As soon as Jin Seol-woon dropped his arms, I poured out questions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How did you get here?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s a way we all know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon smiled meaningfully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Go Ye-ho lightly bumped fists with Hae Mi-jun and continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I contacted my former manager. Told him we’re suffering terrible humiliation here so get ready to pay compensation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Turns out it was Go Ye-ho’s master plan. No wonder he’d been so quiet—he’d texted his former manager in that urgent moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As this spread to the Association in real time, Jin Seol-woon, the Twelve Zodiac leader, got wind of it, and as soon as he understood the situation, he opened a gate here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We can’t let Korean successors be rescued by foreign hands.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually, he covered his mouth with the back of his hand and added slyly,
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And if we handle the resolution ourselves, we’ll be able to get proper damage compensation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected of an idol. Maybe because he’s been rolling around harshly in society since childhood, he knows how to escalate things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he’d even finished speaking, Jin Seol-woon’s gaze left me. He looked at the small-sized familiars gathered near us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His thick eyebrows shot up, apparently surprised.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know how they came out. I guess things were just urgent. But that doesn’t mean we’ve awakened again or our attributes have returned.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For Jin Seol-woon, who’s usually calm about everything, his silence was unusually long. Still unable to hide his surprised expression, he muttered to himself absent-mindedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Familiars could exist even without masters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s this about now? Even when I asked in confusion, Jin Seol-woon just smiled and avoided answering, saying it was our business.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he had an expression like a long-held worry had been resolved, looking relieved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “With this, the wood attribute can be maintained. I should contact Myo Cho-hui-ssi and have her bring out her familiar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly? Myo Cho-hui—no, Baek Cho-hui—is a case where contact was cut off as much as Yoon Sae-geon after retirement, and as I expected, she’s running a restaurant business with her parents using hunter compensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had safely cut ties with Myo Cho-hui… Even if I don’t know, if Jin Seol-woon politely makes an official request, Myo Cho-hui won’t be able to refuse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Could you give me the snake? Even if its power is weak, it would be better for us to have it. I’ll entrust it to Ma Cheon-ah-ssi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Go Ye-ho, who had picked up the snake, readily handed it over. The snake looked back and forth between Jin Seol-woon and Hae Mi-jun, then followed Jin Seol-woon’s outstretched hand. It seemed the water attribute was a natural enemy to it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After safely receiving the snake, Jin Seol-woon also gestured toward us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The mouse and dog too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, the mouse turned its body around sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While we were all a bit flustered, the mouse wriggled and slipped through the front of my shirt to hide inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon looked puzzled and casually tried to peek inside my shirt. Then he flinched and stepped back a couple of paces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now that you’re no longer hunters, there shouldn’t be any bond either. Why on earth…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog also hid behind Han Hyeong-woo’s legs and crouched down. It was wary of Jin Seol-woon as if it absolutely didn’t want to be separated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Would you just like to take them with you, Gang-hyeon-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon just made a gesture of brushing off his hands. He suggested it as if he had no regrets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What would I do with them?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Keep them as pets or…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Does that make sense?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though they’re weak, the two familiars have both healing power and earth power. We who have already retired shouldn’t have them. Jin Seol-woon, who’s still active, should rightfully take them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …But I couldn’t bring myself to say it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I glanced sideways, Han Hyeong-woo was looking at me warmly as if to say I should do whatever I wanted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Rustle*, the mouse rubbed its body inside my clothes. A cool energy flowed familiarly along my skin. The dog that had been behind Han Hyeong-woo was now rubbing its head against my leg.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That sensation was so familiar, and I thought I’d never feel it again… Somehow I didn’t want to give them up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked at Jin Seol-woon and said clearly,
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll take them.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Go Ye-ho insisted, so we ended up going to a bar before taking a taxi home late at night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Phew.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, our house. The strength left both our male bodies. I exhaled deeply and released the tension from my shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is your house. Do whatever you want and play. Just don’t break anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as we arrived, I released the mouse and dog.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two spirits looked around as soon as they were put down. They didn’t seem scared about being dropped in an unfamiliar place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More than anything else, I was desperately observing Han Hyeong-woo’s complexion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The cocktails Go Ye-ho recommended were all strong whiskey and vodka-based. I was sipping them as offered, but Han Hyeong-woo took them away from me halfway through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo hates it when I drink. I understand, but it’s old business.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, claiming to stop me from drinking more, he drank everything himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So now his face had gotten a bit flushed. The sight of his body turning red beyond just his face was unfamiliar, making me steal glances, but the look in his eyes as he stared at me was ominous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like he was going to cause trouble.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You go wash up in that bathroom. I’m going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sensing an approaching crisis, I tried to escape vaguely… but an arm was already wrapping around my waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo hugged me from behind, sliding his lips along my neckline and constantly making sucking sounds. The movement was thick and moist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly became hazy from the alcohol. More than Han Hyeong-woo, I was the problem. Without realizing it, I touched my tongue to the lips Han Hyeong-woo had lightly pressed against mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo pulled my shirt from my pants. His hand slipped in densely and caressed my bare skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wherever his hot palm touched, stimulation bloomed. Below my navel trembled softly. While tilting my head to the side and kissing, my back fell onto the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yeah, I don’t know either. I didn’t push away the muscular chest pressing down on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My pants came off first. Han Hyeong-woo chewed on my earlobe while pulling down my underwear too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey why, *gasp*, the outer clothes and tie are still…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something suddenly seemed strange. My bottom half was completely naked with even my genitals exposed, but my top half remained as it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My eyes met Han Hyeong-woo’s. He just chuckled with eyes hazy from drink. Then he slowly lowered his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Past my upper body and stomach, to between my fully exposed legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that sight, the fact that we were doing lewd things while fully dressed in suits instantly became secondary. I flailed my arms desperately to stop him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I didn’t wash! Please don’t put it in your mouth! Rather! Rather use your hands…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely managed to stop him just before his tongue touched the tip of my reddened member. A sigh of relief naturally escaped my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But having barely prevented this one thing was nothing compared to what would happen throughout the night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At dawn, when the loud moaning sounds in the room finally quieted down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two small familiars that had been wandering around the house also finally began to nod off sleepily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog, who yawned loudly first, hopped up onto the sofa. The mouse also jumped up. As the dog curled up in a circle, the mouse nestled right into that space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally pressing their bodies together, they fell quietly asleep.
 </span>
