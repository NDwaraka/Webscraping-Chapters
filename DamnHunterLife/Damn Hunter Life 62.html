  The Twelve Zodiac community is divided into two boards.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One is a talk board where people discuss the successors, and the other is an analysis board where they debate combat and abilities. The former is presumed to have a high female ratio, while the latter has a high male ratio.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hot topic that set the analysis board ablaze was undoubtedly the disclosure of the successors’ stats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among them, the topic that continues to be endlessly discussed even now was this:

  My first talk show in my possession life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Things were going well with a light and cheerful image, but at the very end it spectacularly crashed because of that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shock was so severe that on the second day after the talk show ended, I sent a one-on-one chat.

  Heavy footsteps echoed on the second floor stairs I was looking at. Soon Ja Hyeong-woo came down wearing a t-shirt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had a “no way” expression, discovered me on the sofa and his face completely hardened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You… without even saying anything. Why did you come?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t plan to provoke anger from the start, but just the existence of me in his personal space seemed unpleasant enough that Ja Hyeong-woo clenched his teeth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You also came to my house without permission.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s deeply tanned face turned slightly pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What, are you scared about that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Way back when the Mouse Familiar tried to kill me. You just barged in then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What again. Why is he relieved this time? He got tense just from a slight hint, so I thought he’d be more shocked if I mentioned it directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can never figure out that bastard’s psychology.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That was a dangerous situation. Anyway, you, don’t just enter without permission… It’s rude.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t come in if there’s no business either! I’m here because we need to talk in secret. Otherwise why would I do something that makes both our faces red?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perfect deflection.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At my words, Ja Hyeong-woo seemed even more upset. The sigh he drew up from his dantian and exhaled was blatant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He looked at my face, looked once at the sofa I was sprawled on, and sighed again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I the only one who’s uncomfortable?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I frowned and grumbled. Then Ja Hyeong-woo stopped sighing, but his eyes became quite prickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, he must know I have some business. Ja Hyeong-woo obediently walked trudging to the opposite side of the sofa. He sat at the very end and didn’t remove the cushion that was there, instead placing it on his lap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I hadn’t originally planned this, but as we exchanged words, sure enough I got excessively heated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems I need to control this heart that keeps getting hostile toward Ja Hyeong-woo before important conversations. The goreum on my sobok rose and fell greatly due to deep breathing. I felt Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I put my legs up on the sofa and sat properly facing Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know there’s bullying among the water attribute students?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m talking about Ja Hyeong-woo’s subordinates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I asked literally meaning ‘do you know about it.’ Simply to lead into the explanation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I already know that at this point, Ja Hyeong-woo has no clue about this incident. So this question wasn’t blaming him for not knowing. It definitely wasn’t criticism either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes deepened. At the same time, his gaze became sharply cold. But that wasn’t directed at me, it was like when facing monsters… the look toward some kind of enemy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you mean by that? Can you tell me in detail?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It started from when I first saw that delinquent Ha Gwon-yeong or whatever at the water attribute gym.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If training wasn’t too harsh, if there was no schedule, if my body was okay. Under the premise that I had such physical and mental stamina, I walked around the entire school with my &lt;Boundary Between Life and Death&gt; skill activated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were five different attributes, and the school was large. I might not have discovered everything by myself… but anyway, from what I collected, there were actually fewer bullying incidents among students than expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the few situations that existed were extremely malicious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m planning to gather the circumstances for major publicity and clean up the school a bit. From what I can see, the water attribute kids are the top priority right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, the biggest issue was Ha Gwon-yeong’s gang from water attribute. I nearly fell victim to them directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The circumstances I scraped together show that people from Ja Hyeong-woo’s adult and high school divisions have been continuously subjecting children from Hae Mi-jun’s high school and middle school divisions to contempt, verbal abuse, bullying and slander.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s especially severe in water attribute, so we need to catch them. In water attribute, the ability gap between the two successors is too large, so a hierarchy naturally formed beneath them.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked confused. Well, who wouldn’t be? If someone told him that the people he’s leading were secretly doing bad things, Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t easily believe it either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Given that, I thought Ja Hyeong-woo might initially deny my words for a moment, or suspect me as a troublemaker first and argue back…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was too ignorant. The students were doing such things while invoking my name.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprisingly, he accepted reality quickly. In other words, he believed my words too rapidly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was before I even brought out the evidence videos and recordings I’d gathered while wandering around the school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That… I don’t know whether the Status Window recording function or phone voice recording would be legally recognized as evidence, so I always recorded with both. Listen to one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t delicate enough to be shocked by vulgar swearing in recordings, I just played a random recording.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Idiots who look like Hae Mi-jun. Hahaha—.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I knew it, Ja Hyeong-woo had come close enough that we were almost touching heads. Ja Hyeong-woo had moved closer first and I didn’t push him away. There was a lot to explain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now that Hae Mi-jun has become much stronger than before, his subordinate hunters naturally gained more spirit so the harsh words decreased. But still, since Hae Mi-jun’s subordinates are weaker than them, the contempt remains the same. These bastards will never think to apologize.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo remained serious without changing expression. His troubled gaze seemed to harbor guilt toward Hae Mi-jun as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It’s all my fault.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was resting my chin on my raised knees, then sullenly averted my gaze to the side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does burying your head in the ground make you feel better?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt Ja Hyeong-woo lift his head and stare at my profile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere becomes strange like this maybe once in a hundred years. Each time I should say something annoying to ruin the mood, but this time I had no choice but to say something different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How could someone who trains to death and collapses from overwork pay attention to things like this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But well, that’s not something for me to say to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah. I mean, keep training like that. You help the world that way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As someone who periodically drives Ja Hyeong-woo crazy to induce intense training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After confirming that Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression had cooled, I quickly returned to the original topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, these bastards aren’t complete idiots, so they skillfully avoided the successors’ eyes. Other successors probably don’t know either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been listening silently, suddenly asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How did you record this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tension gathered under my chin for a moment. Are you trying to suspect me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, Ja Hyeong-woo’s long loose hair and his solid arms extending from his short sleeves caught my eye unexpectedly. I realized this guy wasn’t in his usual armed state, but in a disheveled state at home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When our eyes met, Ja Hyeong-woo somehow seemed like a different person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone else showing concern… for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at the same time, I actually know. There isn’t really anyone else who worries about Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What dangerous… things have you been doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His whispering voice seemed to seep not into my ears but into my heart. Goosebumps rose on my spine. A strange sensation swept over my entire body, reaching even my toes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For various reasons, excuses didn’t come to mind easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Saying ‘I just went around secretly and carefully’ would be… too unbelievable. Losing persuasiveness would be a bonus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how easily Ja Hyeong-woo accepts things in general, this was a serious matter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So for the first time to anyone, I showed my semi-awakened skill &lt;Boundary Between Life and Death&gt;. Of course, I didn’t reveal everything, just vaguely said it was classified as a miscellaneous skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I become like a ghost. Some physical force disappears and others can’t see me. I collected information while moving around with this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I directly used the skill and disappeared before Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes, I had the strange thought that his eyes were still looking straight at mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hesitated before speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you sure it’s a stealth skill? I can still see you right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was the most bewildered. No way, did my skill have such a flaw?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could it be that I was visible to everyone all this time but they all pretended not to notice because they didn’t want to get involved with Gyeon Gang-hyeon? Was it a Truman Show… I thought that far, then my wildly racing mind stopped at the realization that then I wouldn’t have been able to obtain these evidence recordings either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then why Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
