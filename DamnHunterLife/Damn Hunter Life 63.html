  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 63
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is that? Is it because this guy is the original protagonist?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t know. Let’s set aside the stealth skill mystery for now…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, I shared everything I had investigated about regular hunter factions and bullying problems with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wood attribute Myo Cho-hui was the only successor of her attribute, so there weren’t any factional fights. Though I should look into whether there’s any personal ostracism or conflicts within.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, the first and only metal attribute successor to appear, had recently finally accepted regular hunters who had no affiliation and shared her power with them. It was a newly formed force with few numbers, so there didn’t seem to be any particular problems there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire attribute had two people: Sa Ye-ho and Ma Cheon-ah. But since their abilities were similar, there was no superiority between factions, and communication between successors and regular hunters was active, so no problems had been found currently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then what remained was one: earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Earth attribute had as many as four successors. So there were four affiliations. (Since I have no affiliation, it’s exactly three.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since they had the most people, disturbances were bound to be frequent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, since Woo Sae-geon alone reigned as such a powerful figure in earth attribute, I had thought that hunters affiliated with Woo Sae-geon might act arrogantly toward hunters from other affiliations…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Surprisingly, the earth attribute hunters were also fine.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t that there were no weird guys, but it was a similar level to other attributes. Woo Sae-geon might have managed them directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, one crazy bastard from earth attribute was clinging to Yang Pyo, who was a successor no less, and threatening a successor, so we needed to pay particular attention to this side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I finished the briefing by telling Ja Hyeong-woo about Sheep successor Yang Pyo and Kim Sang-ju. (I had already talked with Yang Pyo beforehand. We were no longer in a position to hide things.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fortunate that other places are okay. We just need to overturn the water attribute.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he would be the one to face the most backlash from this as the top healer of water attribute, Ja Hyeong-woo’s resolve was firm and there wasn’t a trace of hesitation in his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s the exact plan?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then we should move on to the next procedure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to organize all the violence incidents in the school into documents and deliver them to the Hunter Association and external parties.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “External parties?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Police. And I’m going to ask my manager to find a decent reporter too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I want is to instill a sense of alarm in both the delinquent bastards and the general public.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the perpetrators are loudly reported and condemned by the public, everyone will be shocked. Then this kind of thing won’t happen again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And citizens will realize something too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I want to point out how unhelpful and meaningless it was to simply watch public areas with surveillance cameras under the pretext of protection, and remind them what true ‘protection’ is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Before that, we need to notify all successors that we’re going to expose this and get their consent.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that process, no student who isn’t a perpetrator should be exposed as prey.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially successors who have a lot to lose and can be exploited.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This shouldn’t be a report that you or I are making, but teamwork where all successors stepped forward for a clean school.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a record. The longest time I had spoken seriously in front of Ja Hyeong-woo without sarcasm, without provoking anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ignored it even when Ja Hyeong-woo stared at me as if he couldn’t adapt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Let’s make it seem like all successors reported it.’ This was an idea I came up with so Yang Pyo wouldn’t get dragged down by the media because of his former friend bastard, but thinking about it, this was necessary for everyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘From what I know from the original work, all eight successors were essential allies to protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo. Not one of them can have their mentality broken. There’s even combat coming up right now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was at it, I showed him the still incomplete documents. Ja Hyeong-woo took the papers I handed him and read them thoroughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It seems like you’re capable of handling this alone, so is there a reason you told me about this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, an answer didn’t come right away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the beginning, I had tried to find exactly one colleague to discuss and proceed with work together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was also a victim and knew more about this matter than anyone, but I hesitated to involve him. He’s young.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just need to show Hae Mi-jun that things are being resolved well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The reason I moved started from you.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tried to make eye contact with me while holding the papers. Even though it was uncomfortable, it was hard to avoid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really, just to confirm whether I knew, that’s all? …Did you perhaps suspect that I was turning a blind eye while knowing about the violence?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t suspect anything like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the same sofa. With only one cushion between us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Too close to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With other guys, being fellow men, anything didn’t matter at all, but why do I end up calculating distance only with Ja Hyeong-woo… It must be because I dislike him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But to back away now would hurt my pride.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I couldn’t do either this or that, the second hand ticked several times, and a faint softness appeared at the corners of Ja Hyeong-woo’s mouth, making me feel unsettled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then, you must need me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a confident statement without any intention to tease me. Ja Hyeong-woo was confident that I needed him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Even in such a serious matter, saying something like “I don’t need help from someone like you!” would be too childish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just this once. Saying something nice to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “To collect testimony from victim students, someone like me who’s a bastard won’t do. There needs to be someone who can give them trust.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason I deliberately wanted to drag another person into this and proceed as a joint work was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To carry out such a heavy and big task of comforting hurt students all by myself on a large scale… actually, I was anxious in a corner of my heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because if you’re the original protagonist, the moment you hear this story, no matter how much you hate me, you’ll jump in and participate in implementing justice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re trying to put me in front of you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo muttered as if he understood my heart completely. Then my hand automatically crumpled the sobok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got up from the sofa and turned my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After arriving home, embarrassment came belatedly. Why did I say goodbye so out of character?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let’s forget this too. Like that damn past photo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo moved by squeezing time even during harsh training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Gyeon Gang-hyeon had requested. He personally met with all successors one-on-one and conveyed what they were trying to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m using you. I’m afraid people will curse at me if I step forward.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without reacting to those words from Gyeon Gang-hyeon at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he told Jin Seol-woon, he seemed truly surprised. Apart from always being gentle with Innate fandom, he was too distant from regular hunters, so he seemed to have never even imagined such a situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The second was Sa Ye-ho. Ja Hyeong-woo already felt tired thinking about listening to his noisy questions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it seemed he needed to evaluate Sa Ye-ho a bit differently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When talking about verbal violence incidents, Sa Ye-ho’s sharply slanted eyes didn’t relax at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okay, got it. Tell me if there’s anything to help with.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even said he would seriously support them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But is this something you thought up and are doing alone?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho threw a question. To that, Ja Hyeong-woo answered honestly. He had no intention of hiding anything from successors at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m doing it together with Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then a grinning smile appeared on Sa Ye-ho’s face. His gaze kept following Ja Hyeong-woo’s movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo turned around, meaning if you have something to say, say it. Sa Ye-ho chattered noisily as if he had been waiting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You guys get along better than I thought?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Regardless of what the truth was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t something he wanted to deny to others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Ma Cheon-ah’s case, it was tiring as expected. She couldn’t contain her temper and wildly emitted hot fire energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right now, I should cut off all those bastards’ limbs…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Calm down. Cheon-ah, I don’t want to put you on the list for retaliatory assault.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, Myo Cho-hui didn’t say a single word throughout the explanation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did you and Gang-hyeon end up doing that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though they had been colleagues for several months, Ja Hyeong-woo had really rarely seen Myo Cho-hui in private settings. In private, she seemed gentle like her public image at first glance, but absolutely not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She was always empty inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because we saw it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo dryly recited the reason he could express and turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Going public…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought young Won Ha-ri would be terrified to hear this fact, but she unexpectedly nodded her head calmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, what caught Ja Hyeong-woo’s attention was something else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that Gang-hyeon oppa isn’t actually a bad person should also be made public. It was a murmur she let slip.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You have the least connection to this matter, so you don’t need to worry. Your enrollment was recent too. And you’re the youngest.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. And um, you know. Please tell Gang-hyeon oppa. If there’s anything I can help with, tell him to call me. What if someone who knows Gang-hyeon oppa is going around doing this tries to threaten him or something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri was quite close to Gyeon Gang-hyeon, so she could contact him directly, but for some reason she looked at Ja Hyeong-woo and asked him to ‘pass along the message.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did they seem like a close relationship? Ja Hyeong-woo felt good.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With a feeling like he had resolved a little bit of the long-experienced hunger, he looked up at the sky and let out a small breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Won Ha-ri said that? Tell her it’s fine. I am a scoundrel, but I won’t go as far as being human trash who makes a fifteen-year-old kid beat up others.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this was just a shallow sense of fullness that would quickly be extinguished by one sound of Gyeon Gang-hyeon caring for Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
