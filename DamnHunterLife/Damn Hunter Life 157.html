</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’re suspending stage broadcasts.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That announcement was already several days ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t check public opinion. I told Sa Ye-ho to look at it appropriately and just let it pass if the reactions were within expected range. Since he hasn’t said anything, fortunately it seems there haven’t been calls for my impeachment or anything like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump, thump.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I was just standing on a hill I used to visit often, looking at the moon in the night sky, my heart beat unstably. To the point where I worried it might strain my entire body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I close my eyes, it feels like I can hear that ringing—beep! from that time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I picture Ja Hyeong-woo standing next to pools of blood, looking up at the sky with empty eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The S-grade staff that had been broken and reduced to mere twigs. The traces of kids who had stained the area with blood, whom that staff couldn’t save.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I thought those bloodstains belonged to ordinary citizens, I committed the pathetic act of mindlessly self-harming to try to make Ja Hyeong-woo grow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when I realized they might belong to Hae Mi-jun, Won Ha-ri, or other successors… I couldn’t maintain my sanity at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As a result, I didn’t do any other ridiculous things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m just preparing for the stage that’s coming in two days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gust of wind blew. As I shrank into my padding from the winter cold, I suddenly looked down the hill as if someone had pulled me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A guy who wasn’t even cold, wearing only traditional warrior clothes, met my eyes while his long black hair fluttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I frowned slightly from déjà vu.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the current Ja Hyeong-woo, instead of turning away, came up toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, standing close, opened his palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A familiar shape that seemed like it had been mine. Seeing the blue mouse, the trembling around my eyes subsided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar hopped up and climbed onto my shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I hate you. Aren’t you leaving?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar pretended not to know and burrowed into my padding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Honestly, both master and familiar…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shameless creature was acting cute. I frowned because the sensation of it moving around tickled me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t nag me to go inside because the night air was cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unless he had unwound his scarf and wrapped it around me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did he bring it out because of me…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, how does this bastard know to follow me like a ghost when I’m feeling sorry for myself? Even the mouse familiar doesn’t stay attached to me anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A water attribute student saw you and told me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t ask!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The warmth of his heated body temperature and Ja Hyeong-woo’s body scent wafting out. More than that, I was more annoyed that my troubled inner thoughts had been completely exposed. My cheeks subtly heated up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even without words, Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze made me uncomfortable. I chose to stare at the sky to avoid his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I hadn’t saved the original Gyeon Gang-hyeon and wasn’t here now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Would all of this now be weight that you, Ja Hyeong-woo, would have to carry alone?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aren’t you scared?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I knew it, a rambling question had slipped out of my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Ja Hyeong-woo was quietly looking at my profile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m scared.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That big guy, who was as fearless as Yoon Sae-geon, readily admitted it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because you’re scared.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original story’s lone, lofty healer wasn’t there. The current Ja Hyeong-woo was just a bastard who always followed me with his eyes and was dying to rub against my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So in a way, it was right for me to become leader instead of Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t make up his mind, if I looked toward my comrades’ safety and peace, Ja Hyeong-woo would follow and look there too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look at this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window Ja Hyeong-woo had come to show me while I was racking my brains over stage 33.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s precious but extremely difficult-to-activate advanced heal skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You have to feel like the world would collapse just thinking about the person you’re trying to heal dying, and be so desperate you’d want to give your own life.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An advanced heal that could only be used on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But below that, an unfamiliar message had appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  *Existing activation conditions have been erased.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now Ja Hyeong-woo could cast his advanced skill without any conditions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Skills could change for better or worse, they said. This case followed a change of heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did Ja Hyeong-woo change his mind after seeing me accept the leader’s responsibility and not leave my desk?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire time I was looking at the moon, Ja Hyeong-woo never even glanced at the sky from start to finish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t feel the winter wind on my right cheek, where Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze had been resting the whole time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to become close enough to kiss and embrace you even when it’s not for healing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …What?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d just given him a good evaluation, and that’s what he says now? I was dumbfounded and stared at him with my mouth open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t back down and sought my eyes with his pupils.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s true that I try to heal you, but I really get excited. …I want to do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He threw the words while looking straight into both my eyes. Feelings that felt more impure for being honest. Like a heavy shield rather than a pebble. As if I were a fortress wall, he crashed into me straight and true.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d frequently said things like liking me before. He’d persistently repeated it, afraid I might ignore it, forget it, or pretend it never happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this was a statement of a slightly different nature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He wants to hold me—’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, I shook my head vigorously. I was just confused for a moment because of Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze and voice, but there’s no need for such polite expressions between men.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He said he wants to do it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could it be, right now…? Fortunately, that didn’t seem to be the case. Ja Hyeong-woo’s condition was calm and when I sneakily looked, the front of his pants was fine too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo smiled softly at my appearance of rolling my eyes around in confusion like I’d been struck by lightning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m just saying this so you won’t be too nervous the day after tomorrow. Try to distract yourself by thinking about me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, he was serious. Perhaps to a considerable extent, I should consider that Ja Hyeong-woo had become cunning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t have to give some answer, do I? Like yes or no.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as that thought reached me, my feet moved on their own. I ran down the hill with thundering steps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t follow me! I’m going to sleep.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right. I also took out the mouse familiar from inside my padding and threw it at him. I ran away again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t throw it hard enough, so whether the mouse rolled on the ground or not wasn’t my concern. My survival was more important.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I tried not to show my anxiety to the kids as much as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The different stage number from before. And the powerful fire attribute spirit monsters and A-grade rating that were announced to appear there seemed to have affected the kids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, I don’t mean someone got scared and tried to run away. Even Yang Pyo didn’t say such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The limit was 7 people, but the problem was that everyone wanted to go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Am I actually the biggest coward?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When did everyone become so brave?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought choosing who to take among nine people would be a headache since I had to pick seven, but it turned out deciding who to exclude was the bigger problem.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After much deliberation, I chose not to take Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jigwi are fire demons from the Queen Seondeok legend. Won Ha-ri was too vulnerable to fire by nature, making it too dangerous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, she was also the successor with the strongest killing power. Our combination without Won Ha-ri was also dangerous. But I had already made my decision firm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When we figure out what’s behind the stage numbers, I’ll use you again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. Let me go with you now. I’ll work harder. I can do it more stably than before. I won’t make Gang-hyeon oppa worry…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sixteen-year-old girl begged to please be allowed to go to a dangerous place. For this young kid, neither achievements nor fear were important.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The impatience of having to wait while letting me go into a fire pit alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I smiled gently and patted Won Ha-ri’s shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Watch the house.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri froze at the casually thrown words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her body suddenly stiffened, and soon her brown eyes became moist with moisture. A dazed voice flowed from Won Ha-ri, who had deeply bowed her head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okay. Oppa.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t ask why she answered informally. I pretended not to know and left, showing her my straight back even if it was gaunt and unsightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the next successor I excluded was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not because you’re lacking somewhere. I won’t say you’re too aggressive anymore either. This is just your turn to rest. You need to recharge your skills, don’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah threw a fit, but I didn’t reverse my decision. She struggled for a long time, saying to exclude Mi-jun or exclude snake oppa, trying somehow to secure her spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then she deflated on her own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After glaring at me like an enemy, the next moment she relaxed the strength in her eyes and whispered in a small voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m anxious when you’re not in front of me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also patted Ma Cheon-ah’s shoulder, saying I’d sweep everything up so if she was anxious, she should sleep in the meantime. I boasted loudly that everything would be finished when she woke up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I have to succeed. I have to pull it off.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Returning my thoughts to the present, I took a deep breath. Then I looked ahead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything visible was burning. It was a hellish scene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see burning spirits rising from all directions to devour the living.
 </span>
</p>
