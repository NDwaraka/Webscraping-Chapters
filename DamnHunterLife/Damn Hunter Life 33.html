  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 33
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was hopeless, but his whole body was telling the truth. This bastard can’t lie well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Won’t it eventually get to the point where how many times I went to the bathroom, what I ate, and what I did all gets reported?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky needs to learn to keep his mouth shut urgently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As we headed toward the gate’s center where we had promised to meet up with Won Ha-ri’s group, we caught all the snakes we encountered. I shot arrows and Ja Hyeong-woo used long-range talismans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced at his profile as he concentrated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If it had been Hae Mi-jun or Jin Seol-woon next to me, I would have suggested making a bet on who could catch more.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Either way, isn’t Ja Hyeong-woo one of the few people around my age near me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when I imagined myself laughing and fooling around with Ja Hyeong-woo, my brow naturally furrowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s kind of cringey. Will such a day ever come?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Casual conversation like we just had was rare between Ja Hyeong-woo and me. I had never once sought him out, and Ja Hyeong-woo also didn’t approach me on purpose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s concern for me would be genuine. Because he has a nature full of compassion. Just like the original protagonist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He would have cared about anyone else, not just me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, unless you’re an idiot, you can’t help but notice that he’s especially more excessive toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much of a troublemaker he is, we were childhood friends. …And almost the only friend in Ja Hyeong-woo’s life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Only by desperately treating him badly can I manage to create even this much distance.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being slow, I kept falling behind. Ja Hyeong-woo matched my pace, reducing his stride and walking slowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Far from being frustrated, I could feel his consideration as he silently waited for me, which made me uncomfortable instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “At least curse at me once for being slow as hell.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My breathing was labored, probably because I’d run out of arrows and was shooting ones made with earth abilities. I barely managed to move my mouth while trying not to pant too heavily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been walking ahead, stopped abruptly. I almost bumped my forehead against his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If I make you that uncomfortable, I’ll do as you want.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he was going to get angry, he should have done it earlier, but Ja Hyeong-woo seemed to explode at strange points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right now we can’t go separate ways. You endure it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His words, spat out meticulously without showing his expression, subtly scratched at my insides.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had been kicking away all the stones in front of me, but even that wasn’t enough—I stumbled on flat ground. I barely managed not to fall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quickly turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Watch where you’re stepping properly. Do you want to fall?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he was already heated, his tone was harsher than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you want me to carry you on my back, keep doing that. But know that I won’t put you down even outside the gate.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What kind of novel provocation is this? It’s groundbreaking for Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who do you think would be scared? Go ahead and carry me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally, if we had gotten on each other’s nerves this much, we should have parted ways appropriately, but the problem was that we couldn’t distance ourselves since we were inside this damn gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why you shouldn’t have followed me for practical training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If that’s how you’re going to be, I won’t end it just with carrying you on my back. I’ll carry you out in my arms.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, go ahead and try.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The thought gave me chills, but I deliberately pushed harder. As Ja Hyeong-woo’s training stimulus, I couldn’t be flustered by such petty tricks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What more can you do to me, huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At those words, Ja Hyeong-woo stares at me with a strange look. Soon, his lips were opening as if to say something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re making noise to lure the boss, right? Right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A high, clear voice interrupted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We must have reached the center where we were supposed to meet Won Ha-ri’s group. Myo Cho-hui approached with a bright smile. Her hair, which was usually in twin tails, was roughly tied into one and swayed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, who would have moved alone with Myo Cho-hui, seemed to have faced no particular crises and was quietly waiting in the distance. Snake bodily fluids were on the blade she was holding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What Gang-hyeon should have done with Hyeong-woo was practice engaging in combat while protecting and covering the healer. Did you do that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Who’s supposed to cover whom? Me covering him?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How am I supposed to cover that huge guy? You’re good at jokes, Successor Myo Cho-hui.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui was kind even to a troublemaker like me. Dimples bloomed brightly on both sides of her mouth. It was exactly the smile that South Korean people go crazy for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t used to it, so I cleverly averted my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’ve gotten used to it, let’s start the gate conquest. It’s not good to leave gates unattended for long periods either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If gates are left alone for too long, energy spills out beyond the cracks. Then trees, buildings, and the surrounding environment all get damaged. Extended citizen control is also troublesome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We haven’t found the boss monster yet, so should we split up again to search? This time, how about Ha-ri goes with Hyeong-woo and Gang-hyeon comes with me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could tell that my face had probably turned even paler than before. Myo Cho-hui, who was so small she didn’t even reach my shoulders, grabbed my sleeve while grinning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gentle and harmless appearance wherever you looked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Having read the original work and knowing about Myo Cho-hui…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think Ja Hyeong-woo would be better than being alone with Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought I had just spoken out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t me but Ja Hyeong-woo. With that large frame of his, Ja Hyeong-woo looked down at Myo Cho-hui as if he would crush her and said firmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon will continue to stay with me. Let’s maintain the search groups as they are.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui raised the corners of her mouth a little more and smiled brightly. It could have looked like a cheerful appearance that wasn’t displeased even with opposing opinions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But she showed not even a hint of bewilderment, making her look somewhat doll-like.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shouldn’t Ha-ri also get used to the feeling of accompanying a healer? What do you think, Ha-ri?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Oh, I’d like to try practicing various things too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, who becomes an obedient youngest member to other successors except me, flinched in surprise before timidly expressing her opinion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a natural answer since they were colleagues who would need to work together in the future. There was no longer any legitimate reason for me not to go with Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo just turned around without looking at me. Won Ha-ri quickly followed after such Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just stood there blankly, then followed behind when Myo Cho-hui took the first step, saying “Shall we go too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s surprising that Ja Hyeong-woo, that bastard, tried to stay longer with me whom he dislikes—’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was surprising but understandable. Well, Ja Hyeong-woo was an early member of the successors like Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s probably because he knows Myo Cho-hui… well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We continued searching the gate. A rabbit doll hanging from a string on Myo Cho-hui’s weapon—a glaive larger than her own height—swayed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps finding just walking boring, Myo Cho-hui started talking to me. The conversation topic she brought up was about me at the Busan Gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Myo Cho-hui praised me for saving the healer at that time, I had nothing else to look at so I watched that doll.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I knew you would awaken someday. To fight so magnificently right after awakening.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t that I was giving a shy answer because the praise was unfamiliar. Myo Cho-hui’s praise was genuinely uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “See, you’re someone who can do it when you try. You’ll show us more amazing things in the future, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t go much further before I stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Could I… rest a bit? I’m tired.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All that talk about amazing things just died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t just because I was reluctant to be with Myo Cho-hui for long—my legs were genuinely strained. The more I continued walking, the more it felt like my leg ligaments were being squeezed. Eventually, I declared surrender to Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm, let’s do that! Will you really be okay if you rest?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t guarantee it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I’ll look for the boss. But it’s dangerous to leave you alone, so let’s do this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was sitting on a rock to rest, I flinched at the sensation of something climbing up my ankle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t a snake monster. It was Myo Cho-hui’s green wooden vines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This way, I can monitor your vital signs from far away. If monsters attack, I’ll move the vines to help you dodge. This way it’s safe.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wooden vines didn’t stop and continued growing, climbing up my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This way it’s safer! Well then, rest up, I’ll be back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui spun her glaive around to get a better grip and shot out like an arrow. I didn’t have a chance to stop her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I, left alone—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was fidgeting because of the wooden vines that had somehow grown into three strands and were gripping me even tighter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t move?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The vines wrapped around me and moved my limbs as they pleased. My arms and legs were spread wide apart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They definitely said they would protect me, but judging by the position alone, it looked like I was telling monsters, ‘Please catch me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Myo Cho-hui? Noona?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui is older than me. I called several times, but it remained quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, the ground beneath where I was tied and suspended began shaking uneasily, then caused an earthquake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rumble—. The ground visible in my field of vision writhed. Small stones flew in all directions, and the wooden vines and my clothes fluttered together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The resonance of some gigantic life form digging tunnels underground and writhing as it approached.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Very, very ominous. I shouted loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Myo Cho-hui!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the owner of the wooden vines didn’t appear immediately, and only the earthquake grew stronger. Now my whole body was shaking so much that my teeth were chattering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This, no matter how I think about it, leads to only one conclusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Objectively, if I were to see my situation and appearance from a third-person perspective.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Myo Cho-hui used me as bait to quickly draw the boss monster out of the ground.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To make good use of me even when I’m exhausted and can’t move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While she was praising me and packaging it nicely, this is the extent of the value Myo Cho-hui places on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the vibrations grew stronger and a large life form rose from underground, I broke out in a cold sweat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I knew from reading the original work, seeing it in reality was scary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not the cheerful image known to the public, but the true nature of the person called Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
