<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fanfare announcing the Successors’ final victory rang out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon turned away from Sa Ye-ho, who was hugging him while shouting cheers loud enough to make his ears ring.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A conversation they’d had some time ago suddenly came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cheer up. Do I look disgusting because I’m excited?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was quite a while ago now, when Sa Ye-ho had grinned after securing his name as the fifth and final spot on the friendly match roster, then belatedly tried to gauge Woo Sae-geon’s mood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In cases like this, he would usually act cute in various ways, desperately trying to make Woo Sae-geon look at him even once more, but for some reason Sa Ye-ho had acted quite seriously that day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t think the Hunter Olympics are just ‘mindless entertainment for show’ like you say, hyung. It’ll be a chance to improve teamwork and overcome our own weaknesses.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They’d been fighting gate monsters all this time, but monsters and people are different. They’ve never tried to persistently exploit hunters’ weaknesses until now, so this was also a new training method… that was Sa Ye-ho’s argument.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next, what Woo Sae-geon recalled was the broadcast coverage of the 4th set match he’d confirmed through video last night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“「Sa used a fake to shake off Quiche! Very impressive」!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“「Ma was standing exactly where Clyte was going to attack just now. Most of FirstCall’s skills are being predicted! Who’s giving commands? Is it Woo? Or Sa」?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having organized his thoughts, Woo Sae-geon’s gaze caught his subordinates standing here and there around the arena.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Congratulations. You were fucking awesome」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte extended her hand to Ma Cheon-ah, who she’d just been competing against.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah firmly grasped her hand. Then, without either taking the lead, they pulled each other close and bumped shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the one with the greatest joy of victory was undoubtedly Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who could only let out exclamations while trembling all over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He felt Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest touching his back and unconsciously spun around to grab and hug him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eek!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he was immediately horrified.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Gyeon Gang-hyeon regained his senses, he stopped bouncing around and kicked Ja Hyeong-woo’s shin with all his might.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the spot where Gyeon Gang-hyeon had escaped from, only Ja Hyeong-woo’s two hands remained forlornly, having had his waist stolen away again before he could even properly hold it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are those two doing a comedy routine?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon glanced down. Sa Ye-ho was watching the two and giggling without removing his arms from around his neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon turned his gaze forward again and thought:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Successors would keep rolling even if I left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For someone who had been very skeptical about the friendly matches…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had given it his all. In other words, he had fulfilled his responsibility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Led by Woo Sae-geon’s combat cuts, videos of the Korean Successors spread around the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In every scene, their flowing hanbok sleeves fluttered and flipped. It was such a spectacular sight that it silenced all the viewers who had been commenting that such long clothing wouldn’t interfere with their movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon standing alone, fighting all five members of FirstCall at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it was an unfavorable situation, whenever you looked up to see his face, you got the illusion that he was relaxed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes stirring up the battlefield alone, Woo Sae-geon also knew how to support his teammates like a proper tanker. In the capture battle, he showed the appearance of a support-type tanker, reducing his direct attacks slightly and physically blocking damage coming toward his teammates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon fought separately in most situations and didn’t need his teammates’ cooperation, but he occasionally performed combination moves with Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like the moment when Sa Ye-ho stepped on Woo Sae-geon’s supporting hand and charged at Buster with his strength added.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment when Sa Ye-ho’s foot lightly landed on the sword blade Woo Sae-geon aimed, then leaped up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who despite being a healer had his name inscribed at world rank 15, also showed performance worthy of that reputation. He was unbelievably skilled in combat for a healer. The scene where FirstCall came to target the healer first and got their noses bloodied was truly a highlight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It goes without saying that the female warrior Ma Cheon-ah fluttering her jet-black martial robes was tremendously gallant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for the decisive scene he showed at the end, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was essentially beaten by Agni dozens of times. Of course, there were some irregular scenes in between.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At one point in the 5th set, Gyeon Gang-hyeon collapsed into the arms of Agni, whom he’d encountered one-on-one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh? The flustered Agni tried to check on Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who seemed to have fainted as he fell into his arms. And then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk—! An arrow shaft pierced Agni’s neck. It seemed like pretending to faint and confusing the opponent might be a decent trick to try at least once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, most of the time he died helplessly to Agni. So would Gyeon Gang-hyeon be cursed as the Successors’ only blemish, the so-called ‘dog troll,’ today as well?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not necessarily. Koreans now knew he was a skill-focused hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And because Agni was more hateful, he was relatively overshadowed. The people criticized Agni instead of Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ma Cheon-ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The heat of the comeback victory had also faded, and everyone was about to go rest. Gyeon Gang-hyeon called out to Ma Cheon-ah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your score is 4:2, my score is 4:0. Right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Ma Cheon-ah remember. The score bet she’d made with Gyeon Gang-hyeon before the match started.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The final score was 4:1.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s grinning face, Ma Cheon-ah finally realized his intention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s goal from the beginning had been to create a score that was neither 4:0 nor 4:2, invalidating the bet itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he’d succeeded!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah scrunched up her face and somewhat desperately grasped at straws.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Th-then since we both lost, we should both do the dance challenge.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon shrugged his shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to? There was no such rule?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah returned to her lodging gritting her teeth and rolled around on her bed in frustration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘After just trolling the whole time, he finally acts human at the last minute!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That refreshing and bright smile somehow lingered in Ma Cheon-ah’s mind for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I should have gotten that dancing video!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She regretted not being able to make Gyeon Gang-hyeon do the dance challenge. If she could get her hands on that video, Ma Cheon-ah could have endured having to film it together herself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, she might not have had any plans to upload it online from the start. Even so, she had wanted to have that video.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If she had that video… she would have played it sometimes when she thought of it. Whether he danced shyly or acted confidently, she would have gazed at that face, and might have left this kind of monologue at the end of each viewing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…if only his personality was a bit better.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bored, Ma Cheon-ah turned on her phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s hobby was searching for her own name on communities. She enjoyed reading posts that started with ‘Cheon-ah unni,’ ‘Cheon-ah hyung,’ and so on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Ma Cheon-ah pressed the search bar, a list of recent search terms appeared below it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were search terms she could never show to anyone else, even if it killed her.
 </span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Korean Successors were guests, and the host of this place was the American Association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So we tried to return quickly as soon as the match ended, but an official hurriedly stopped us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Could you please stay until this evening? If awakeners with great abilities all leave at once, the hunter who created the space could suffer significant physical damage. Please. We’ll prepare meals and pay compensation as well」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, we were forced to stay and rest for one more day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah was walking around outside taking selfies with Clyte. She’d made a new friend outside school for the first time in six months, so she’d want to enjoy it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was probably sleeping. Sa Ye-ho was also quiet, so he was either sleeping too, or with Woo Sae-geon – one of the two.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sleepy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not wanting to get out of bed, I said it out loud, then hugged my puppy plushie and rolled around for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But soon, I steeled myself and got up with a start.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now when no one was paying attention to me, there was something I had to do here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Boundary Between Life and Death (Earth Attribute)&gt; is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The semi-awakened skill I hadn’t used since gathering evidence on those delinquent bastards. I turned it on for the first time in a while. I briefly felt the sensation of the earth attribute skill as my body temperature rose slightly, my feet became a bit heavier, and I gained arm strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slipped out of the lodging.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My destination was the core building at the center of the arena. The officials there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The audience uncles who came for the match are actually people from the World Hunter Association.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I couldn’t miss this opportunity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t read the latter half of the original work, so I don’t perfectly know what major crisis might be at the end. There might be the possibility of large gates appearing on a world scale beyond individual countries.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Just in case… let me approach with stealth skill and eavesdrop on whatever they’re talking about. Maybe I can pick up at least one useful clue for the current situation?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw one American bodyguard in front of our lodging.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sneaking over (even though I knew my footsteps wouldn’t make sound in ghost state), I tried moving my head back and forth or waving my hands in front of that person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m really invisible, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, ever since I learned that this skill didn’t work on Ja Hyeong-woo back then, I had been growing suspicious of the stealth skill I’d been trusting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What the hell is it. From how Woo Sae-geon couldn’t see me before either, it doesn’t seem like strength is the criterion.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the bodyguard couldn’t see me at all either. It seems this skill works on foreign hunters too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The building at the center was also shaped like a hanok. I hopped inside when no one was at the entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Walking a bit down the corridor, I heard unfamiliar voices softly from a nearby room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did I find something?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The door was closed so I couldn’t peek in to see who it was. I stuck close to the wall and turned on the translator on my phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I recorded the sounds coming through, translated content immediately appeared on the screen. As soon as I read the top line, my eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside, they were talking about our Successors.
