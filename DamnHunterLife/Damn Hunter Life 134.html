<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When it felt like the long summer was finally ending, the temperature suddenly dropped. Right after Woo Sae-geon—no, Yoon Sae-geon—left, the season became properly chilly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is a curse Woo Sae-geon left behind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he’s retired now, I keep habitually calling him by his Twelve Zodiac surname.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s cold even wearing two layers of sobok. Shivering, I kicked the door open with my foot and slipped into the office.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hi there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who was lying upside down with his feet up on the sofa backrest, waved his bare feet instead of his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I find this place uncomfortable and unwelcoming since Yoon Sae-geon’s DNA remains here, but Sa Ye-ho was sprawled out very comfortably as if it were his second home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The spacious office was also one of the few modern spaces in this school. It’s like they took a high-end office from a glass building and attached it inside a traditional hanok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s the only space where we can contact the awakener system that controls us, it was probably created this way to show thorough security.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the other stuff is just junk, but what’s important in this office are these electronic devices on the desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This computer and laptop won’t break no matter what happens, and people without authorization absolutely cannot operate them. You can think of them as having biometric recognition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And now that’s my responsibility. Since I’m the general manager.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I really, really didn’t want this, but what can I do? I’m responsible for Ja Hyeong-woo becoming a delinquent.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least I should escape being a delinquent from now on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It feels like the world has completely changed in a few days. Even though the office is warmly heated, I still shivered once as if I were outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I entered the office, I sat at the desk, turned on the computer, and entered the student management system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho taught me how to operate it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Show me how to turn it on.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. First, this is the power button. And this is the mouse. If you press here, that’s clicking. Also—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I check every student’s daily life, combat, and training progress every day, and keep track of personnel going in and out for external gate management.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also had to manage the school’s buildings and finances. I exchange official documents with the Association regarding gates, broadcasting, and all other external matters. Meanwhile, caring for the successors had to be top priority. Since we need to prepare for upcoming stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it manageable?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had approached the desk, leaned his arm on my left shoulder and rested his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re heavy. Get off.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I brushed him off curtly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to do it because it’s sudden, but the work is just whatever.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So it’s manageable.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Simply put, think of student council. Usually student councils have a president and vice president, with secretary, general affairs, and treasurer as additional roles. It’s not hard to understand if you think of their roles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Except here, the student council president does everything alone…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least Sa Ye-ho handles document processing and dealing with the Association President for me. I’m like the student body president and leader, while Sa Ye-ho handles documents.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would have been stressful for both sides if I had to deal with that Kim Jae-moon guy frequently, so this worked out great.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Apparently Sa Ye-ho has been watching Woo Sae-geon’s side very well, seeing how the Association subtly pisses us off whenever we might forget. It’s so rewarding to inflict the disaster that is Sa Ye-ho on Kim Jae-moon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ding ding, several notifications appeared on the powered monitor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [October 13th outing, ‘Ja Hyeong-woo Successor’s 2 members, Myo Cho-hui Successor’s 1 member, Sa Ye-ho Successor’s 1 member, Yang Pyo Successor’s 2 members’ confirmed.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Partial damage reported in Fire attribute girls’ dormitory building 2. Transmitting cause and repair cost details.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, I don’t need to personally investigate school internal affairs on foot. The system handles the middle part well. I just need to review and approve each item.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The problem is… the school doesn’t have much money.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the 2nd leader position was passed to Gyeon Gang-hyeon, the school faced some difficulties.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Money problems. That is, the school’s budget decreased compared to Woo Sae-geon’s time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Points where combat ability-based training scores occupy the largest share.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But how much could I have brought in with my shabby abilities? I barely had enough to live on.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is why I kept thinking about points from the beginning. I saved up planning to support Ja Hyeong-woo when he became leader later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But me being leader directly is different!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, points…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho leaned his arm on the desk and looked at the monitor screen together. Then he pointed at one spot on the screen with his index finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Click there to open the file. Sae-geon hyung should have organized monthly budget plans and settlements, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Where Sa Ye-ho pointed showed records of the massive points Korea’s #1 hunter earned from training scores, all going to school expenses without a single won used personally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides that, I often see traces Yoon Sae-geon left behind in this office. Traces that don’t smell human at all, but would smell like machines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Yoon Sae-geon didn’t tell me anything separately, I thought he just ran off, but it turns out he did the handover to Sa Ye-ho before leaving. He fulfilled all his duties until the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But still… I seriously think. Didn’t Yoon Sae-geon pass leadership to me to screw me over?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You try it too. See how you like it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I feel like I can hear Woo Sae-geon’s thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I’d known this would happen, I would have lived nicely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, aren’t you going to training?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you go~”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was anxious during welcome parties and such, but the situation was better than expected. Most importantly, the other successors are diligently maintaining their usual routine. Maybe because there’s already an established routine, everyone wasn’t slacking on training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Work harder. Because of my image, people might say you guys became lazy…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I gathered them before and said this, they’re even showing more enthusiasm by extending training time more than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It says everything that Sa Ye-ho comes back after completing his training time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, sprawled on the sofa again, looked cheerful and happy. Why has he been like this for the past few days? He looked like death until the day before Yoon Sae-geon left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘His mouth corners might split. Staying quiet then giggling alone. Has he gone crazy?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon didn’t return to America and surprisingly remained in Korea. According to Sa Ye-ho, he’s preparing to open a personal tattoo shop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He has tons of money from retirement funds, but he likes his main profession. Just like Sa Ye-ho would continue broadcasting even if he received retirement compensation enough to play around for life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether because they felt sorry that Korea’s #1 was leaving like this or simply thought it was big news, reporters searched frantically for Yoon Sae-geon for several days. They only backed off after getting cursed out by Yoon Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon apparently just lives normally. As if being a successor was just a dream from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he lost the Twelve Zodiac’s power, his physical abilities didn’t completely diminish like when he was a regular person, so I heard he’s adapting to tattoo work again with his changed arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s even taking regular customers by appointment. I don’t think I could get tattoos from Woo Sae-geon because he’s too scary.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yesterday, sighting reports of Woo Sae-geon’s current status were apparently posted on communities. Of course, the posts were taken down quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was spotted grocery shopping normally, pulling a cart at the mart, while owning the entire personal shop building and nearby buildings. Buying fruit, buying 4 cans of discounted beer. Buying side dishes at a side dish shop. With his long hair tied low in a single ponytail.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I finished computer work and called Sa Ye-ho on the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho. Connect me to Woo Sae-geon on the phone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I Siri?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d prefer not to hear his voice anymore if possible, but that’s somewhat difficult. Since Yoon Sae-geon was the former leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you call your hyung? Did he cut you off?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He blocked my number.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked at me pitifully while somehow seeming satisfied, then tried to hand over his phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But just before I could grasp it, he suddenly snatched the phone away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Something seems weird? Didn’t you get blocked for doing something wrong?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is why quick-witted bastards are…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How can I not call Yoon Sae-geon? How fun is it to bother retired people?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I called through other kids’ numbers and got them all blocked. You’re the only one left.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I reached out toward Sa Ye-ho’s phone. Then Sa Ye-ho hugged his phone to his chest and whined like a 5-year-old in resistance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No way. What if hyung blocks my number too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader’s authority. Hand it over.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In conclusion, I couldn’t steal Sa Ye-ho’s phone. The damn guy pinned me down on the sofa and overpowered me—what can a powerless leader do?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just that drained my energy, then I even did training at the training ground. I trudged back exhausted and wanted a nap… but I had to eat. I’d die if I didn’t.
 </span>

  I’m still eating with Jin Seol-woon every other day. At Jin Seol-woon’s place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought it would just be awkward, but Jin Seol-woon surprisingly listens well. Then he talks about himself too. Just ordinary stuff.

  How the weather is, how training is, how recent songs are.
