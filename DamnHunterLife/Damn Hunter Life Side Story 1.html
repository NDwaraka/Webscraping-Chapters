  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 1
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the official end of the stages, the successors’ burden was reduced. Now they could live a bit more comfortably as leaders of hunters, lounging around more than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, regular gates still existed. The threat of high-level gates similar to stages also remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, regardless of other things, the association’s opinion was to continue the successors’ training as before without reduction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you know what? That has nothing to do with me now. What are you doing grabbing a civilian?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ahhhhh don’t hang up!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I abruptly hung up on Sa Ye-ho’s call. Then I quickly turned off my phone before Sa Ye-ho could call back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the call ended, silence quickly filled the empty officetel where I was alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stared blankly into space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No status window appeared. There wasn’t a single notification.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I don’t know what I’m waiting for. I suddenly came to my senses and moved my body. The silence felt uncomfortable, so I turned on the TV too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Listening to the sound filling the house, I newly realized that now I could lie down comfortably since there were no clothing ties on my chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suddenly reached for the table. I picked up and looked at the ID card I had received through Park Yoon-seok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Cheon Gang-hyeon (千强炫)
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon’ is just the name of a retired hunter like Woo Sae-geon. Even if all people, including me, haven’t adapted yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put down the ID and touched my shoulders that had felt empty since earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had gone to the salon earlier and cut my hair, which used to come down to my shoulders, up to my nape. Manager Park Yoon-seok accompanied me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, I know long hair suits me well, but living alone, it was bothersome to take care of my hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But somehow the news leaked, and I got a call from Hyeong-woo asking to see my hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you not to contact me during training hours.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After giving him a fierce warning, I took a selfie with my phone and sent it to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The response came 10 minutes later. The read receipt appeared as soon as I sent it… don’t tell me he stared at it for 10 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Cute.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [You always had it that length before. Since it’s short, your handsome features stand out more.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to curse at the “cute” text, but after seeing the follow-up message, I deleted the curse I was typing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few days after I was kicked out alone, Hyeong-woo, who had been reading the mood, casually asked me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m asking in advance because I might make a mistake. Would you prefer I not talk about old stories? If you say you don’t want to hear them, I’ll be careful.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, it was a topic I didn’t want to think deeply about. I wanted to just live with an empty head for even a few days. Even if that was really stupid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, just as I had the right to enjoy what Cheon Gang-hyeon possessed, I thought Hyeong-woo also had the right to miss Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Say it if you want to. I should listen too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Hyeong-woo didn’t decline.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“During elementary school, you received confessions once every semester. That’s just what I saw or heard, so there were probably actually more, right?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But somehow, it seems like even a child he birthed himself wouldn’t be praised less than that…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wasn’t that just being friendly, and you distorted it because you were jealous?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yeah, I was jealous.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, that was 10 years ago…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“There were definitely boys who had feelings for you too. They just hid it. You were more popular with boys than girls.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Damn, you call that a compliment? If you’re going to say shit like that, don’t even open your mouth!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was nonsense worse than not hearing anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just curse at Cheon Gang-hyeon instead, no, curse at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Hyeong-woo was making cringeworthy sounds as he pleased, I grumbled as I wanted to. But actually, I was wrapped in a strange feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day I vomited all the resentment I didn’t even know I had, the day we both shed buckets of tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought I’d become awkward with Hyeong-woo and couldn’t even make eye contact. Or that I’d become speechless with mixed feelings as soon as I saw his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [‘Photo’]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [What’s all this junk]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I moved everything you used to my house.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [If you do anything weird with it, I’ll kill you]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What melancholy, it was just like before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, since I was fierce before, is it different from the past? Anyway, it’s more ordinary and peaceful than I thought, so even I’m flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since people don’t really change dramatically, it’s also true that I still can’t speak gently to Hyeong-woo. But this is what, the old Cheon Gang-hyeon was like this too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Everything’s comfortable and good, but… what do I do with my life now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had never deeply thought about what to do after retirement. I just thought anything would be fine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever it was, for Cheon Gang-hyeon, it would be things he couldn’t properly try while staying in the hospital.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I have no obligations, and the world will be protected by those below me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who would tell me to study, who would tell me to earn money…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was exactly one thing I did with a sense of duty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I took a taxi by myself without asking Manager Park Yoon-seok. I thought that gentleman would secretly feel sorry if I told him the destination. I didn’t like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It didn’t take very long by car. It was within Seoul.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I entered a quiet and clean columbarium. I wore a hat pulled low, worried someone might recognize me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The burial niches of unfamiliar man and woman greeted me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man in the photo next to the flower basket had the same surname as me and similar eyes, while the woman had snow-white skin like me and identical features.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Mom, Dad.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I deliberately pronounced it aloud as if I were someone learning to speak for the first time. The pronunciation came out very stiff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No words came out, so I just endlessly looked at the photo of young Cheon Gang-hyeon smiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll come again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I couldn’t say any proper words and turned my back. I felt like my legs would give out and I’d collapse if I stayed any longer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I still feel like this is all a show.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon felt like a stranger to me, too naturally. There were no such optimistic things as memories returning or suddenly realizing that was me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It just felt like being shown someone else’s memories and hearing claims that it was me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when I heard about my parents at Hunter School, I never once thought of them as my parents. So there’s no way this columbarium would feel related to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve never felt strange feelings either…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly my chest tingled. My throat became stuffy as if my lungs had narrowed. I stood with my hand against the wall and quietly caught my breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ve felt this sensation with Hyeong-woo before too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that’s all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should remember. I absolutely shouldn’t forget memories of the people who gave birth to me, regardless of anything else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What am I exactly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …What else, an empty person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I came home and forced myself to eat dinner. Although a housekeeper comes, I ran the vacuum and washing machine myself. I had to prove I was okay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My phone rang once and I knew a text came, but I didn’t check it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was better being alone without Hyeong-woo. I couldn’t show him this state. I needed time for things to sort themselves out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ended up vomiting all the food I had eaten before going to bed. I must have had indigestion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sob…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I heard a strange sound by my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was so startled that I bolted upright. Then I immediately collapsed back down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I could understand the circumstances of the situation in my confusion, tears started falling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I seemed to have dreamed something, but I had no memory of it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt like this had happened before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Deep fear washed over me. Without even fully waking up, I curled up like a shot animal. Covering my mouth with my hand, I sobbed, not knowing what was so sad.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t want to cry…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to hold it back, but I only got exhausted faster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly the light from my phone screen attacked my eyes. When I frowned, more tears poured out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after hearing the dial tone from my phone did I gasp and come to my senses. I had done it without knowing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I couldn’t immediately press call end because I wasn’t in my right mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon, why?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unfortunately, the call connected before I could hang up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart sank. I pressed the pillow hard against my mouth and held back my sobs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The silence flowed for only a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …He seemed to have guessed just from my breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I bit my lips even tighter. I clamped my mouth shut so air wouldn’t get in and my crying wouldn’t leak out. Then something welled up in my chest and I felt painful pressure that made my heart ache.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It’s okay. It’s okay…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the whispering voice, I finally made sobbing sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I buried my face in the pillow, and Hyeong-woo quietly listened to my sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy who usually asks about everything wanting to know, at times like this, recognizes it like a ghost and says nothing. Hyeong-woo waited patiently until the sounds I was making completely subsided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Drink water. Is there water nearby?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to ignore it and sprawl on the bed, but somehow Hyeong-woo knew and kept talking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t want to get up, but I had no choice but to get up eventually.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, Hyeong-woo asked if it was okay to switch to a video call, and I hesitated but gave in to weakness and accepted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He turned on the stand light on his side so I could see him. I didn’t turn mine on. I just hid in the darkness and looked at Hyeong-woo’s calm face lying down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strangely, just looking at his closed lips and gentle expression, I could fall asleep.
 </span>
</p>
