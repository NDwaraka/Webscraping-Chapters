 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though my fever had mostly gone down, I was in an uncomfortable mood because of the original protagonist who kept hovering around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “36.7 degrees. You still need healing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, that’s normal body temperature!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Normal body temperature is 36.5 degrees. You still have a fever.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh, this inflexible bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That guy needs to get lost so I can pursue my grand plan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was cursing him out in my mind, Ja Hyeong-woo opened the door wide without even knocking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing that bastard’s face suddenly made me unable to contain my anger. I threw the wet towel from my head at his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it fell to the floor with a splat. Because Ja Hyeong-woo tilted his head just 5 degrees to avoid it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His utterly calm tone was even more annoying. What a boring guy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a psychological test. A sudden flying wet towel social experiment, don’t you know?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tilted his head then just sat down in the chair in front without saying anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A guy who doesn’t know how the world works, that’s what he is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, I hate looking at your face and don’t need you, so get lost.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as he sat down in the chair, Ja Hyeong-woo’s movements stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His gaze as he stared at me became sharp, but I continued without backing down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Incompetent bastard. Go train more. Isn’t the reason my fever keeps rising because your healing ability is lacking in the first place? Go upgrade your skills more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time you’re wasting on me right now is preventing you from growing. How precious is one hour, one hour of the mouse successor’s training time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My goal was ultimately hunter pension. But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Before that, is there any guarantee that Korea will still be intact by then?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For my goal to be achieved, I ultimately had to stop some giant gate that appears in the final chapter of the original work. Only then would the survival of Korea, including myself, be guaranteed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I don’t know the latter part of the story perfectly either. I didn’t know well when that time would be, and how strong I needed to be. In the end, I had no choice but to create situations so that the successors would become suitable combatants by then and prepare as much as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially Ja Hyeong-woo, who was the original protagonist and had many overpowered skills, was most important.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, I once again verbally fed Ja Hyeong-woo some disgustingly bitter medicine. Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression rotted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Right. I seemed to have forgotten for a moment because you were sick. That you’re not worth spending time on right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The effect was definite. Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t even look back, put on the durumagi hanging on the coat rack, and left abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I told you to leave ages ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After I recovered enough to barely stand up and walk, I thought about outside my room, which must have been in a terrible state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How many points does home repair cost…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Hunter School system was available through points. Items or services other than basic food, clothing, and shelter had to be purchased by paying personal points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, furniture and houses artificially broken like this could only be repaired by paying points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I checked Gang-hyeon’s points once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

  “Ah shit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head rang at the hopeless balance situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard Gang-hyeon was barely getting by on daily allowance points, but his balance was rock bottom, probably because he spent those points on alcohol.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How do you earn points?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think you have to fight or receive hunter education and show results…”
 </span>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know that too!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least hunter education might be something I could somehow attend with this body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I run dead last and completely ruin the successor’s dignity, unlike the original Gang-hyeon, I don’t particularly have any pride, so I don’t care…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But that would take at least several days, so I can’t fix the house until then?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I opened the door to check the corridor, I had just one wish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Please let the bathroom be safe…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The house is intact?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The house that the familiar had joyfully destroyed was spotlessly clean as if it were a lie. After looking around bewildered, I suddenly had an idea of what happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo must have fixed it before leaving!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected of the original protagonist’s sense of responsibility. I was counting on it. Even if he curses me with his eyes, he won’t leave debts unpaid. This one thing is good.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then there’s nothing to repair? Why did the estimate come up? Bewildered, I pressed the home repair function once more.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A while later, it was revealed that the original Gang-hyeon had been postponing repairs of places he had previously broken… Following the original Gang-hyeon’s example, I decided to postpone it too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep, beep, beep—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, a notification appeared on the status window saying a communication had come. I could see the name of the person who called. It seemed to be a name Gang-hyeon had saved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Busybody]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Who is this?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I answered the phone, I heard a middle-aged man’s voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hello, Successor Gang-hyeon. This is Park Yoon-seok.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hmm, if I ask this question, I’ll look like a strange person… but the original Gang-hyeon was strange anyway, so it should be fine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who did you say you were?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Park Yoon-seok.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who is that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expected the other side to be flustered and struggle for a while, but the answer came immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m the manager assigned to Gang-hyeon-nim by the Hunter Association.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A manager that the association assigns one-on-one to successors. Also called a manager.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Gang-hyeon originally died in episode 1, I didn’t know such a person existed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I remember. What’s the matter?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Um… are you perhaps in an extremely good mood today?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is asking how I feel the matter?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“No, it’s not, it’s just.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Mr. Park Yoon-seok stammered in confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could tell without seeing. The original Gang-hyeon must have been extremely nasty. But suddenly I’m being docile, so he’s wondering what’s going on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Mr. Park Yoon-seok didn’t seem like the type to nitpick over trivial things, as he immediately got to the point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Could you possibly come to Hunter School headquarters at noon today? The association says they have points to give to Successor Gang-hyeon.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A summons to Hunter School during daytime?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t believe the latter part…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Excuse me? I didn’t hear that.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, nothing. I understand. Tell them I’ll go then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Thank you.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After hanging up, I pondered deeply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know how incompetent the association I saw in the original work is. For the successors, the association was practically the villain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, if there was one thing the successors and the association had in common, it was being cold toward the troublemaker Gang-hyeon. But would they give point gifts for no reason? It must be a trap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the association and Hunter School were separate. Outsiders can’t enter Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But why would the association tell me to go to Hunter School headquarters?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What does me going to headquarters have to do with the association? This was the key point. I could clearly see they were planning some scheme.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And sure enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Public]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I left my hideout and entered the public area, a red mark appeared on the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to the original work’s setting, the first gate occurred in this world a few months ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gate randomly sucked in hundreds of young people between 15-24 years old, then closed. Everyone expected them to have died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the gate’s true nature was revealed later. It wasn’t a dangerous place, but a hunter training space prepared for future gate breaks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This gate’s name is ‘Hunter School,’ the space where the successors and I are located.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Faced with the fact that young people had to become heroes who save the world without adults, the government decided to broadcast Hunter School to supervise the students’ life and death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Hunter School broadcast, edited and aired by three broadcasting companies, became a huge topic as soon as it aired. The successors gained fans, and students gained income. It became possible to compensate the children who devoted their youth to hunter life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally, the broadcast that started with the purpose of preventing accidents within the school and guaranteeing the livelihood of those who were forced to become hunters…

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Became the worst move due to the existence of general public communities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The constant advice coming from communities was cancer itself. There were numerous young hunters who were hurt by criticism about skill controversies, attitude controversies, and such. It appeared in episodes multiple times too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The [Public] mark blinked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Video call with broadcaster’s reporter will be connected.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The call connection proceeded automatically without my consent. Even if this is a public area, is this okay?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A news reporter’s upright face appeared on the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Gang-hyeon! We finally caught you!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Toward me who just silently raised an eyebrow, the reporter smiled brightly. Then he smoothly recited his lines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Our OO Broadcasting finally reports exclusively on the mysterious successor, Gang-hyeon! Successor Gang-hyeon! Could you say a word for the people of Korea?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Our successor seems to be very shy! Then may I ask you questions? We understand you currently haven’t awakened, so if you were to awaken, which position would you hope for between tanker and dealer?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What do you think about the widespread rumor that you’re hiding because you can’t awaken?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When there continued to be no answer, the reporter seemed to be getting frustrated too. As if trying to ask more provocative questions, determination flashed across his face. And—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I struck first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Reporter-nim, are you a voyeur?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Excuse me? I’m sorry, but what did you—”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I smiled brightly like the reporter had earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Taking responsibility, I’ll say something. The kids here are all young. They’re too young and afraid of getting cursed at by people to even say don’t film us. Gathering like a pack of dogs just to catch something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone had to say this at least once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I’ll do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a troublemaker anyway, so what.
