  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 124
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gestured that if it wasn’t something that couldn’t be aired on the broadcast, he could just take it here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Hae Mi-jun brightened up as if he’d been waiting for permission and immediately answered the phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, Mom! I’m eating right now. We’re filming a broadcast… All together! Yes, yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice was cheerful. What an incredibly affectionate son. Well, it’s not like Hae Mi-jun would lack love anywhere he went. I heard he was a popular honor student at his previous high school too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He only suffered because he ended up at Hunter School.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because I’d been staring at him the whole time, Hae Mi-jun’s eyes met mine after he hung up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Song Mi-jun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Y-yes?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was the name Hae Mi-jun’s mother had been calling him over the phone. Even though that should be his real name, Hae Mi-jun seemed flustered. I guess it’s embarrassing when I call him by it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come to think of it, your original surname was Song, right? It suits you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s face reddened slightly before he smiled brightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Probably after I retire, and much later when he retires too… if nothing goes wrong, Hae Mi-jun and I will still know each other then. At that time, I should call him Song Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I found myself thinking such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was probably because of the sentimental atmosphere unique to evening time, the appropriately bustling noise, the feeling of fullness, and the leisurely relaxed air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, the surrounding scenery began to come into view again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who no longer felt intimidated among the successors and was smiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who should have left long ago since he hates socializing, but was still sitting there diligently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, playing well with Ma Cheon-ah both in front of the cameras and in front of Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Woo Sae-geon, who had somehow become a bit more merciful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work… there were no scenes like this. Scenes of ten people playing in a pool like ordinary young people, or laughing and chattering over several plates of meat at one table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the first moment when all the successors have gathered together for a meal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Have the successors found some stability now? Are they conscious of each other as comrades?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I set aside my troublemaker self and thought about it, it wasn’t a bad sight to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Did you just tell me to take my hands off?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s cold voice echoed through the conference room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Association President Kim Jae-moon thought to himself, ‘This bastard’s starting again,’ while outwardly showing a bland smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I never said it that way. I just told Successor Woo Sae-geon a moment ago, ‘Since it would be difficult for you to make time for each case individually, we’ll handle it on our end.'”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It sounds the same to me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how trivial the paperwork, all approvals had to go through Woo Sae-geon himself. When Woo Sae-geon showed fierce rejection and hostility, the Association President sighed deeply. Then he tried to persuade him with different words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Woo Sae-geon, retirement is right around the corner. Now is the time to distribute work and hand over duties to the next leader.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whether there are 30 days left or 3 days left, my work is my work. Just because I’m dying tomorrow, does that mean I do nothing today?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was the most adult in the school, and had to be the adult, at the age of twenty-four when he couldn’t do so in real society.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had always been on edge. With his characteristically arrogant face, with the arrogance that he needed to know everything that was going on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than give the Association any opening to interfere in every little thing, Woo Sae-geon chose to control everything at his own level.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was a tyrant. He trampled on students’ autonomy and will countless times, forcing them to do what he thought was right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And while doing so—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He took on all the blame for the minor accidents and mistakes that happened at school, and the disgrace of combat and strategic failures.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Woo Sae-geon doesn’t manage Gyeon Gang-hyeon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon was failing to awaken and wasting time, Woo Sae-geon was talked about as much as Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Woo Sae-geon must have ordered it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon was hiding his familiar, the public assumed there must have been orders from Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Woo Sae-geon will handle the scolding himself. What’s the point of us cursing?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything was under Woo Sae-geon’s jurisdiction, so it was natural. The mistakes the successors made in battle, and the criticisms that quickly died down soon after.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please pay attention.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When troublemaker Gyeon Gang-hyeon caused problems here and there, it was always Woo Sae-geon who got the harsh words from the Association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The flow that Woo Sae-geon had intended when he moved to become leader was perfectly realized. Success and failure alike. Whatever the outcome, all responsibility was concentrated on one person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other students just had to be under him as chess pieces, as subordinate employees who bore no responsibility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s psychology that he had never told anyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But these things couldn’t be because of affection or concern for others younger than himself. Woo Sae-geon’s behavioral motivation was firm and clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because it was convenient.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because it was right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The obsession of someone who trusts only himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successor called ‘Woo Sae-geon’ was an existence that Yoon Sae-geon, who had lived in shadowy alleys and had never been a leader before, created to test himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had almost passed Yoon Sae-geon’s test. But no matter how solidly he had built the image of a scholar, if a life bearing everything in the school continued for a whole year, that image would inevitably crack little by little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While preparing for the next stage battle and checking all the successors’ training, Woo Sae-geon, who hadn’t properly rested for even 30 minutes a day, realized that the twitching around his eyes hadn’t disappeared for three days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But anyway, it was only a month now, wasn’t it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The conclusion during that time must not fall apart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the last meat party, except for a few outsiders, the concept of a group had somewhat formed among the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like now, when five people—Hae Mi-jun, Yang Pyo, Won Ha-ri, Ma Cheon-ah, and Sa Ye-ho—sat at one table in the cafeteria eating together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to leave, but Sa Ye-ho grabbed me by the scruff of the neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you know this is a meal appointment that only works if you’re here? All the kids gathered because of you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What bullshit?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he’s saying he’ll use me as entertainment, as a topic of conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri, stop looking so pleased while watching me put a spoon in my mouth, like you’re watching a critically ill patient who miraculously recovered after surgery and is eating.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I had no choice but to sit in the middle and watch as all the kids except me went back for seconds on their meal trays.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, are you going out on another stage?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho asked while licking his ice cream dessert.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I could answer, three pairs of eyes except Ma Cheon-ah’s fixed on me. Whether the main emotion in them was surprise or mockery, there was at least worry mixed in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I said I wanted to go out. I’m planning to stick close to Woo Sae-geon before he retires. Woo Sae-geon needs to be there to carry a troll like me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One month until Woo Sae-geon’s retirement. There were about two more stage schedules set until then. Woo Sae-geon would naturally run both at full capacity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I need to earnestly squeeze in beside Woo Sae-geon and stick to him. After Woo Sae-geon leaves, it might be hard to produce results.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They could just leave one spot empty, but still, Woo Sae-geon included me…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When talk of Woo Sae-geon’s retirement came up, Won Ha-ri suddenly became tense and picked at her food hesitantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Woo Sae-geon leaves, the one who would probably fill that vacant spot would be Won Ha-ri, the only metal attribute among the current Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri had officially never been selected for a stage yet. Under the pretext that more careful preparation was needed because she was so young, she was mainly active in gate support like Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gave Won Ha-ri a look.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Think about the training you’ve done with me so far. When your first battle is revealed, people will say Woo Sae-geon is washed up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “People will sneer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though she said that, I could clearly see Won Ha-ri’s facial muscles relax a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And while listening to my conversation with Won Ha-ri, I also saw Ma Cheon-ah clattering her utensils loudly, as if she didn’t want to acknowledge my abilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Inside the stage was a snowy field covered in white snow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tucked my bow under my arm and hunched my body. My body shook like I had tremors from the unexpected severe cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does this gangcheol thing or whatever originally live in cold places?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’ve never heard anything like that…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Here, gangcheol isn’t a piece of metal, but a legendary animal said to breathe fire and harm crops. It’s a monster that’s incompatible with plants, and it’s in a snowy field. If Myo Cho-hui had been here, who knows what would have happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo looked at me with pity as I was about to freeze to death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while chattering my teeth and shivering, I kept my mouth moving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re thinking of hugging me, get lost.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who would think such a thing?!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before Yang Pyo could finish speaking, something warm from behind me suddenly covered and wrapped around my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a black durumagi. One warmed by Ja Hyeong-woo’s body temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without realizing it, my body relaxed and a languid moan escaped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But immediately after, I couldn’t help but stiffen, because Ja Hyeong-woo’s arms had come from behind and were tying the durumagi strings over my chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Imagining what Ja Hyeong-woo and I must have looked like just now, my fingers and toes twitched from embarrassment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo calmly secured the durumagi and stepped back. Then he immediately pointed at my sobok and made a comment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if it’s underwear, I know it has some cold-weather protection.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve told you how many times this isn’t underwear but clothing? And do you think general cold-weather protection would even register with me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Be quiet. This is a stage.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s low voice brought the topic back to the starting point.
