  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 147

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The morning after Ja Hyeong-woo left, my condition was needlessly good and my mind was clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Training time was approaching, but I couldn’t turn away from the mirror for quite a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was trying various mind control techniques so I could act nonchalant when Ja Hyeong-woo’s real form appeared. It wasn’t easy. My face was already burning even without seeing him in person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hah…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Damn it, I was the leader. Unlike a month ago when I was just a single mola mola fish, as a leader I couldn’t skip group training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At times like this, I desperately missed Yoon Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You’re my only leader. Come back and work. No re-awakening? Please re-awaken.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was insanely envious of that bastard who retired, put everything down, and was living well eating well while ignoring everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mungmung. I need your strength.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because the mouse familiar was gone, I hugged the droopy Mungmung who’d been getting dejected lately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I needed the broad, embracing heart of an earth attribute familiar. A heart deep and steady like earth, unshaken by anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Hyeon has such great energy today! Amazing! Your expression is good too. A little red but no fever. But you need my strength? What should I do?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That… never mind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Our kid is especially bouncy today too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I gently pushed away Mungmung who was clinging to my chest, he suddenly stopped making a fuss and became quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he suddenly said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {A little sad but… it’s okay. I knew.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wiped around his eyes as if touched and stroked my cheek. …I definitely feel like I’ve seen this scene somewhere before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So, like a mother crying while looking at the bride at a wedding…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It suddenly occurred to me that Mungmung couldn’t not know about yesterday’s incident, and what kind of state I must have been in flashed through my mind too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Heat rushed to my ears and cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you talking about! No!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I only created misunderstandings with Mungmung, and arrived at the successor training ground with my head even more cluttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was last. Even without me, everyone was warming up and drawing out their attributes by themselves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung, you’re here?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the massive blue form that had been stretching with his back turned slowly looked toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart dropped with a thud. Time seemed to flow particularly slowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This isn’t anything else, it’s fear. Fear. I got predatory fear from a half-moon bear-sized bulk yesterday. If you’re a mouse, be mouse-like and stay smaller than me!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When my eyes met Ja Hyeong-woo’s…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you sleep well?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the situation I encountered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I almost dropped my jaw unconsciously, but barely held back seeing Hae Mi-jun’s fervent gaze looking at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Hey
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Don’t you have a conscience? Do you even feel sorry to me?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: I wouldn’t mind never seeing your face again
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: If you know what you did to me was wrong, don’t talk to me outside
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse Successor&gt;Me: Yeah. Sorry. I’ll be careful.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was barely relieved by the obedient answer that came back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened the leader authority status window and called the kids together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop chatting. Let’s start training. Today…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze didn’t leave me throughout the training. He even wore what looked like an annoyingly happy smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is that your idea of trying to be careful?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had regressed to his childhood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Han Hyeong-woo who would smile just from making eye contact with Cheon Gang-hyeon, would follow along and do whatever Cheon Gang-hyeon did while sending admiring looks, and would sometimes tremble as he barely held back his desire to pat that small head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ve been getting irritated, venting my anger, and pushing him away for nearly a year because I was afraid this would happen… I’m screwed.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During training and during the breaks in between, the other guys kept glancing at me and Ja Hyeong-woo. For the appeal of being ‘innocent,’ I deliberately put strength in my eyes and stiffened my neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I briefly made eye contact with Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I found it hard to endure the gaze that maintained its heavy persistence from my side. Even though I felt uncomfortable doing this, I turned my head away first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But where I turned my gaze, there was Ja Hyeong-woo again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s a limit to being shameless. Do they think we’re having some secret romance? If they’re going to think that way, at least keep it ‘secret’!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After growling at each other until yesterday, if you’re suddenly smiling in one day, wouldn’t everyone think it’s strange?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But since he’s smiling, his face is somewhat bearable to look at…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I snapped back to my senses. It was a crazy thought. I pressed the chat buttons firmly while even feeling shame. I wanted to hit either my head or that bastard’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Don’t even look at me
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse Successor&gt;Me: You’re pretty so I can’t help it.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash. It wasn’t overacting—I really tripped because my feet got tangled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo might come running to help me up, but would I deliberately do such a thing?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, Hae Mi-jun was nearby, so I was safe. I somehow avoided any physical contact with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a while, I feel like just seeing that bastard’s palm would bring back that sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did he really eat something wrong? Does he have no shame? No dignity? That kind of talk comes out to me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How many dog-like things have I done and how many months have we spent like that? Does it make sense that all of that would disappear like melting snow?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Bastard with no substance.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart has been off since earlier. It’s somewhat interfering with continuing the group training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not anxiety, but ambiguous emotions that aren’t quite irritation kept surging up. In an emotionally unstable state, I just bit my nails with my teeth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I spotted Won Ha-ri right in front of me and flinched. Won Ha-ri tilted her head to the side and approached.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did Ja Hyeong-woo sunbae get your weakness?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yeah, a question like Won Ha-ri’s would be better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even slow-witted Yang Pyo came close while glancing at Ja Hyeong-woo. He whispered in my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you two make up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does this look like we’re on good terms now? It got worse!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when I snapped angrily, Yang Pyo didn’t flinch. I’m not Yoon Sae-geon after all. With a rather displeased face, he said “Yes… well. Sorry about that.” and left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Training ended somehow. The intensity and time were the same as usual, but my energy was completely drained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I gave the dismissal order. I saw it clearly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes flashing brightly, and a smile slowly blooming on his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  About 2 seconds later. A chase where only I was breathless began. I walked briskly through the training ground corridors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He followed leisurely with large strides. My two steps equaled that bastard’s one step, which pissed me off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When we’re alone, I can talk to you, right? Let’s eat together.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The steamed chicken from before briefly came to mind. Ja Hyeong-woo’s eating show that would aggressively boost my appetite too just from watching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, thinking about what those lips that would have spoons going into them did yesterday, I didn’t think I could eat at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tell me why you don’t want to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something clicked in my heart. Yesterday’s promise hit me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I had promised to only tell the truth from now on. Even considering the sins I’d committed against him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the truth… no, I won’t say it! I can’t!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you think I’ve cooled off now? Should I be calmly eating with you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Ja Hyeong-woo stop as if he’d fallen into a trap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How many laps around the training ground had we made? We ended up back at the very first training room. Ja Hyeong-woo kept his distance and whispered softly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry for making you breathless.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Is that an apology for right now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not an apology for yesterday’s incident—I wanted to seriously bang my head against the wall thinking up to that point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll just see who you’re eating with and go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What business is it of yours?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you eat alone, it’ll be because of me. I feel sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Really, everything is sorry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m fine eating alone, so why do I have to find a meal companion because of that bastard?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wondering if anyone might be in the training ground, I opened the door once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I made eye contact again with Jin Seol-woon, who was sitting on a bench with his long legs stretched out while looking at his phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned my head pretending nothing happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon… won’t work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The inner feelings Jin Seol-woon had suddenly revealed to me still confused me. Actually, looking back at everything up to now, it wasn’t completely out of nowhere, but my mind couldn’t understand it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since when? What was that guy lacking that made him…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if Ja Hyeong-woo has connections from the past Cheon Gang-hyeon, Jin Seol-woon only has connections with me after I possessed this body. What the hell did I do?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I plan not to see Jin Seol-woon in private settings from now on. Maybe knowing this, Jin Seol-woon doesn’t ask me to eat together anymore either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, there was another kid in the training ground besides Jin Seol-woon. I shouted loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun! Want to eat with just the two of us?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had been organizing the swords used in training, widened his eyes at my call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he immediately smiled brightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. I want to eat together! Come to our house.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I happily gave my arm to the hand Hae Mi-jun extended. Hae Mi-jun bowed to Ja Hyeong-woo, then pulled me along without reading the atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Has Hae Mi-jun finally regained his self-esteem? Did he accept that he’s not inferior to Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While nodding approvingly, I had a somewhat unsettled feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But just now… didn’t he greet rather carelessly? Could Hae Mi-jun do that?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I say his attitude seemed a bit different only toward Ja Hyeong-woo, would that just be my imagination?
 </span>
