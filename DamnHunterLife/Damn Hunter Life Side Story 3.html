</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You were already a pervert, and now you’ve developed voyeurism too.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One month after the two separated, this was what Hyeong-woo finally got to hear from Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And rightfully so, because Hyeong-woo wouldn’t hang up the video call, making all sorts of pleas and requests saying he was dying to see him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, Hyeong-woo could satisfyingly observe Cheon Gang-hyeon’s daily life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who woke up drowsily at 9 AM, first turned on the video call. He had no choice because he had fallen for yesterday’s coaxing and made a promise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under Hyeong-woo’s gaze, Cheon Gang-hyeon held his phone and shuffled to the bathroom. He set the phone behind the sink and brushed his teeth. He kept giving looks to Hyeong-woo on the screen that said ‘You’re really watching this much?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo watched Gang-hyeon put on a headband to wash his face, spread jam on bread at the dining table in his pajamas, and after eating breakfast, lie on the sofa for a moment scratching his belly while turning on the TV.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Stop watching, you crazy bastard!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In return, he got thoroughly cursed at.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m worried you’ll become lethargic when you’re alone. When I’m watching, you at least move around. I’m watching so you’ll develop regular habits.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was some logic to those words. It was quite reasonable, and Hyeong-woo certainly had such feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Cheon Gang-hyeon knew Hyeong-woo better than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You’re the kind of bastard who takes care of your own desires while pretending to look after me. Must be nice being so efficient, huh?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo smiled sheepishly without any sign of rebuttal or denial. The angry Cheon Gang-hyeon gave the middle finger to the phone screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He already knew all of Cheon Gang-hyeon’s big and small habits, but he wanted to know even the most trivial things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When I retire, let’s live together.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How he folded clothes, where he placed things. What he cared about in the house and what he somewhat neglected. He even carefully observed things like bedding that was never organized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You watch me too. Tomorrow I’ll do it, so you watch.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Your pervert skills really develop day by day.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was preparing so that when the two people who lived separately moved into one house, they could quickly adapt to each other without trial and error.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“When did I say I’d live with you!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s my life’s wish.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Cheon Gang-hyeon pretended to ignore him, Hyeong-woo’s voice gradually changed to a more desperately pleading tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon shut his mouth. After a moment of silence, he spoke in a much smaller voice than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“In the old days maybe, but now I’ve lost all my temper—do you still want to live together even like this?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, he was prone to getting irritated with Hyeong-woo. He did things to him that he didn’t do to other people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo let out a small laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now it doesn’t feel like you’re being irritated. You’re just being affectionate.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even when I really try not to curse at you…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon was truly disgusted every single day. Hyeong-woo had come to enjoy that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Winter at age 21, when he had just failed Hunter School, came to mind. Hyeong-woo carefully recalled that time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Overnight, the shaman’s house where he lived lost its worker. No matter how much of a shaman one was, they couldn’t go against the gate system, so his guardian would have to find another errand runner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I won’t have to do shrine work anymore.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The compensation for working as a successor was good. It was an amount that would let Hyeong-woo not work for the rest of his life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He could pay his guardian back for all the food and care received. Then he wouldn’t need to do shrine work anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then what should I do with my life?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he retired, he should cut off this uncomfortable long hair that the shaman elder had made him grow. Besides that, he couldn’t think of anything he wanted to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then, Hyeong-woo thought his life was frustrating with no hobbies or interests.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But now I don’t need to feel frustrated. I have things I want to do now. So many.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Cheon Gang-hyeon appeared in his life again, Hyeong-woo was reborn.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He lay in bed before sleeping and told Cheon Gang-hyeon this story. Gang-hyeon seemed a bit sleepy but listened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to live in a house with a yard. I want to grow lettuce, herbs, and tomatoes in the garden.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“All food.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And you have to live in that house with me too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon fell silent for a moment as if at a loss for words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Don’t you want to do anything other than gardening?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to learn cooking.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yeah, make your own food to stuff your face with.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And you have to be sitting at the dining table.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The conversation kept going in circles. Cheon Gang-hyeon thought for a bit, then asked hesitantly in a small voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What happens if I’m not home?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some silence occurred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo answered calmly, as if opening his chest and taking out his heart to look at it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re not there… I think I won’t want to do anything. I might not be able to feel interest in anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he made excuses whenever he got the chance, Hyeong-woo knew that Cheon Gang-hyeon’s attitude was gradually softening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or perhaps he couldn’t overcome Hyeong-woo’s persistence and had half-given up, thinking ‘This is my life, what can I do about it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One day, while the call was connected and they were each doing their own things without much conversation, Cheon Gang-hyeon suddenly muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“When you retire too…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo held his breath and waited for his next words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Who’s going to heal the kids?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …It wasn’t exactly something Hyeong-woo would be happy to hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“But Hae Mi-jun has really grown a lot. He can do your part.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon probably noticed too, but pretended not to know and kept chattering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like that, half a year passed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throughout that half year, the calls continued. Hyeong-woo often went overseas for support with other successors, and Cheon Gang-hyeon got his driver’s license. Hyeong-woo taught Hae Mi-jun all the healing techniques he knew, and Cheon Gang-hyeon passed his high school equivalency exam.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Hyeong-woo said he would contract a rural house suitable for the two of them through his manager, Cheon Gang-hyeon didn’t stop him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One year passed painfully slowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But from today, even that painful time could be made into memories.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had returned his hwarang clothes and put on thick padding and fleece pants, hurriedly got in the car without even tying his hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sitting in the back seat, he repeatedly read the text Cheon Gang-hyeon had sent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I’m at the library]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Drop off your stuff and come pick me up or don’t]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From today, he would live with Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After persistent pleading, Han Hyeong-woo had succeeded in preventing Cheon Gang-hyeon from renewing the contract on his original officetel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Which meant…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo tried to calm his pounding heart. He barely managed to lower the corners of his mouth that seemed ready to reach the top of his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He planned to roughly drop off the moving boxes from Han Hyeong-woo’s family home at the new house and immediately go pick up Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had been a year. After a year, he could touch and embrace the real thing. His mouth was completely dry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The rural house on the outskirts of Seoul was already all neatly organized. As soon as Han Hyeong-woo opened the front gate and looked inside, he suddenly felt his heart settle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is my home.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was ‘my home’ that he had never even imagined. The well-trimmed grass was lush and green. The small house painted neatly in white looked incredibly cozy. Han Hyeong-woo unconsciously stopped and stared at his new home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he suddenly came to his senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Let me hurry and pick up Gang-hyeon first.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The most important thing for this house to be perfect was missing. Han Hyeong-woo ran with the intention of throwing down his luggage as soon as he opened the front door and going right back out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the door opened from inside first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the loud voice, Han Hyeong-woo stopped right there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s face, bursting out as if he had been waiting inside the house, colorfully filled his vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon hugged him tightly with both arms. The luggage fell with a thud from Han Hyeong-woo’s hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just yesterday he had been grumbling that he wasn’t coming, but he had already moved all his stuff here and was waiting for Han Hyeong-woo. The talk about being at the library was all a lie too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re warm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon whispered in his ear with an indifferent tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sweet warmth that clung to him felt like a dream. Han Hyeong-woo stood there dazed with his mouth open, while extending both arms to embrace him back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After staying like that for a while, Cheon Gang-hyeon was the first to unwrap his arms from around his neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly embarrassed, he stood awkwardly at a distance. Not making eye contact and turning his back was a bonus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come in and look… around the house.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He entered the house with quick steps, but Han Hyeong-woo had taken off his shoes and wasn’t following him. Cheon Gang-hyeon looked back with a puzzled face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy was just stretching out his arm from where he stood, as if asking him to hold his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon looked annoyed and snatched that hand as if stealing it. The smile on Han Hyeong-woo’s face deepened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even after holding hands, he followed for a few steps then stopped right in the living room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, why again?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s sit and rest for a bit. Come here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
