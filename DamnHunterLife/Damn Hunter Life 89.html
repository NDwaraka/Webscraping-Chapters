  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 89
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the table became calm again with the scholar’s aura in his dopo, only one person remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What had to come, came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Myo Cho-hui, you…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon stopped mid-sentence and pressed his temple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he was deliberately showing his displeasure or really had a throbbing headache. Both possibilities were likely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have nothing to say. You tell me. What exactly is the problem?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, Woo Sae-geon had also properly grasped what happened on the stage, just as I had seen. Down to how badly Myo Cho-hui had messed up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere, which had been tense since my argument with Ja Hyeong-woo, was now completely frozen solid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui wasn’t someone who would be discouraged by Woo Sae-geon’s criticism all of a sudden, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She seemed to have no intention of revealing the cause of her condition deterioration to the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After confirming that Myo Cho-hui’s lips were tightly shut, I quietly opened my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It started with that breaking news a few days ago, didn’t it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The corners of Myo Cho-hui’s eyes, which had been quietly downcast, definitely flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Getting my final confirmation from that reaction, I decided to expose Myo Cho-hui’s secret right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The impact was even greater since all the Twelve Zodiac members were gathered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Some hunter’s parents acted carelessly in front of a gate, causing another hunter to be seriously injured.&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But Successor Myo Cho-hui isn’t the type to get angry over someone getting hurt or someone interfering with rescue work.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon furrowed his eyebrows deeply. The room stirred slightly due to the others who didn’t understand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking directly at Myo Cho-hui, I spoke to her wavering eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hearing that breaking news made you think of your own parents, didn’t it? You miss your parents.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, a faint shame crossed Myo Cho-hui’s expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Or not.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I immediately rolled my eyes and feigned indifference to appear unconcerned, but inside I trembled slightly with elation at having my speculation proven correct.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in the original work, there were very few descriptions of Myo Cho-hui’s private life. Even those were only conveyed as small props in passing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, gathering the small clues allowed one to infer one fact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —A Hunter School phone with only her parents’ phone numbers saved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This meant there was no point in remembering any other acquaintances’ numbers besides her parents’.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Dialect expressions and accents occasionally visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you search for Successor Myo Cho-hui online, her hometown is in the metropolitan area. In other words, the dialect comes from the influence of her parents who came up from the provinces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Traditional tastes like pickled cucumber and fermented soybean paste.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Same as above. She takes after her parents’ tastes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Majoring in food nutrition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you search online, Myo Cho-hui’s parents run a restaurant. …It’s presumed she intends to help or inherit her parents’ restaurant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Counting down the days until retirement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An extension of the first clue. Despite not having any particular acquaintances to contact after entering school, she still hopes and eagerly awaits only the day she can go outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To return to her parents’ side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was… the one and only weakness that Myo Cho-hui, who was described as similar to a psychopath in the original work, possessed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Some hunter’s parents acted carelessly in front of a gate, causing another hunter to be seriously injured.&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone’s parents. Foolish yet pitiful beings who lost their reason and rushed in out of longing to see their child.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did Myo Cho-hui’s parents do exactly the same thing?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought while watching Myo Cho-hui’s shoulders tremble finely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time, Myo Cho-hui’s poker face crumbled. Raw emotions she had never shown before… burst out. Her chair was pushed back with a crash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui glared at me as if she could kill me. Her eyes were red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re really reckless. Voicing speculation without evidence. What if I had been even more shaken than this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui hung her head and stormed out the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah immediately stood up. She sent me a look of contempt and hurriedly followed her out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought Won Ha-ri would immediately follow unni too, but for some reason she kept glancing between the door and me, and ultimately didn’t get up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They’ll see me as trash who knowingly and maliciously touched someone else’s wounds.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t make eye contact with anyone. I just crossed my arms as if nothing had happened after digging up wounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But Myo Cho-hui can take a step toward becoming a true companion by being understood by the successors through this incident.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After all, humanity’s most universal and powerful emotion is anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘By having me as a common source of irritation, they’ll become a little closer to each other.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I straightened my back. I’m always ready to become a villain for the growth of the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cho-hui. Baek Cho-hui! Our daughter!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She knows that only two voices in the world can move her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when the dirty kids in kindergarten, the noisy kids in elementary school, the insignificant kids in middle school, and the sensitive kids in high school called her heartless and tearless, her parents were different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Our Cho-hui is so pretty and smart. Cho-hui is mom and dad’s pride.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They really are irrational.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For Myo Cho-hui, who had difficulty forming relationships with others, only the blood relation of parent and child was different. It was the only unbreakable thread connecting her to the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once, seeing her parents close the restaurant and make “aigoo” sounds while patting their backs, she had decided to become a celebrity. To utilize her greatest strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this really what Cho-hui wants? Mom and dad just don’t want our Cho-hui to be stressed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So becoming a successor at Hunter School was an opportunity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Currently 23 years old, she just needed to endure this unique celebrity activity for only 2 years, then return to being an ordinary person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No more dishwashing or ingredient prep. I’ll make you proper restaurant owners.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after falling into Hunter School, Myo Cho-hui moved while gripping only that thread.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Acting nice? Being cute? Winking? I can do it all.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll be the successor with the most retirement funds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To Myo Cho-hui, whether people caught up in gates lived or died had absolutely nothing to do with her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But while reaching out to bleeding, collapsed people, she often thought:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This person is probably someone’s parent too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They might become someone’s parent in the future.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This kid’s parents would want them to live.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when supporting injured people and her hanbok got dirty with their sweat and blood, she didn’t feel it was filthy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because there were those two characters: parent. With just that, she would fight with all her might hundreds or thousands of times…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You miss your parents, don’t it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At Gang-hyeon’s single sentence, embarrassingly, tears welled up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, who had left, returned with red-rimmed eyes. The interrupted feedback meeting resumed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as it ended, Gang-hyeon was the first to storm out the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun got up hesitantly, trying to catch him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In an instant, swish, someone brushed past Hae Mi-jun’s clothes first and got ahead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun saw Ja Hyeong-woo chasing after him and stopped trying to call Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui also immediately left the meeting room, and Ma Cheon-ah followed her again this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, in the meeting room with those who remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had been crumpled up in the cold atmosphere all along, finally carefully spoke up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung, no, why did Gang-hyeon act like that earlier?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His tone suggested he hadn’t noticed anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho suddenly smirked and looked at Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Funny bastard, isn’t he?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s funny. He has to let us know about Myo Cho-hui noona, but he doesn’t care about becoming the bad guy himself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s expression became strange as he mulled over Sa Ye-ho’s words several times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon, Jin Seol-woon’s voice followed, his hand covering half his neat jawline as he rested his chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi isn’t a bad person. Strategic, maybe.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun nodded slightly in agreement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I also think Ye-ho hyung and Seol-woon hyung are right. Gang-hyeon hyung sometimes acts mean on purpose. He tries to handle all the unpleasant things himself…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had so much more he wanted to say but barely managed to express just this much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He is originally someone with an annoying personality, but sometimes… yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri also trailed off similarly. Her eyes were complicated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the table fell quiet once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the people here had encountered Gang-hyeon at some point. Even without expressing it in words, everyone shared strange feelings toward the person who wasn’t present.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for one person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon just listened silently. His eyes and hands organizing documents.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had been stomping down through the Twelve Zodiac central building, suddenly stopped in the middle of the corridor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And turned around abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blue hwarang robes were visible. Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been following behind him, also stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s unfriendly gaze sharply swept over him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go ahead. Say what you want to say.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having chased after him from that situation, what else could he have to say besides curses? Gang-hyeon, making assumptions, became even more sarcastic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes were strangely sunken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have a question. I’d really like you to answer it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo gazed long and deeply at those clear, bright eyes that showed a hint of surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And asked a question Gang-hyeon hadn’t considered at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are your parents doing well? Auntie and uncle.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon froze solid as if he wasn’t even breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I asked once a long time ago but you didn’t answer properly. And then we… fought.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to be talking about when they fell into Hunter School, Gang-hyeon thought even in his confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The real Gang-hyeon back then might well have avoided giving an answer and been evasive.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon dropped his gaze down and told Ja Hyeong-woo what he knew from investigation, though he hadn’t experienced it directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Both of them passed away. Mom from illness when I was in first year of middle school. Dad the following year in a car accident.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t continue speaking for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t know. I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the first time hearing about Gang-hyeon’s life during the time when he wasn’t with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s pupils, which had been wavering in confusion, disappeared under his eyelids. He closed his eyes and whispered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry. …I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon held his breath at the somehow aching sensation in his chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His head felt strangely hot. Every time he blinked, he could feel the throbbing clearly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why? My parents aren’t… either. Was I always this good at empathizing with others?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, a third party’s presence stirred from the corner close to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, who had been listening to their conversation from behind, quietly disappeared instead of continuing to chase Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unaware of this fact, Ja Hyeong-woo took a deep breath to calm his heart. His softened, affectionate gaze touched Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “After retirement, could you take me to where auntie and uncle are? I was indebted to them a lot before. I’d like to pay my respects.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s eyes trembled. Ja Hyeong-woo quietly watched Gang-hyeon like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, not knowing what to do, he turned around and left without a word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
