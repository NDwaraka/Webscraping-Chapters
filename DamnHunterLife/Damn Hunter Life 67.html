  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 67
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s hand gently settled on top of Hae Mi-jun’s head from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun quietly accepted his touch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he turned around, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was holding something in his other hand and extending it to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can you lend me this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was rope good for tying people up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why does he carry this around?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the rope that had been used to tie up Choi Jung-do, and it seemed like it could be recycled now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun took the rope and entered the training room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on blinked in surprise and the remaining tears streamed down. However, he couldn’t wipe them because he was holding onto Ha Gwon-yeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun approached and dabbed under Yoon Cha-on’s eyes and cheeks with his hanbok sleeves. While wearing a sad-looking smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You did well. You were really cool.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The split lip from the initial surprise attack was also healed by Hae Mi-jun’s touch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After finishing the treatment, Hae Mi-jun soon tilted his head toward Ha Gwon-yeong, who had his face buried in the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to tie him up a bit. I think it’s necessary. No objections, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The last words were in question form, but there was no intention to seek agreement. Hae Mi-jun tightly bound Ha Gwon-yeong’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong had lost all will to resist and was in a dazed state as soon as he saw the successor. He seemed like someone who had briefly gone crazy and then regained his senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this yours? Crazy bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon kicked a pocket knife that had been some distance away with his toe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When even the unexpected Dog successor appeared, Yoon Cha-on became even more bewildered. Hae Mi-jun smiled faintly at him, then stepped back several paces and stared at Ha Gwon-yeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Assault and even carrying a weapon. Ha Gwon-yeong’s atrocities were witnessed by two successors. This would be solid evidence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong had dug his own grave. If this was also delivered to the police, he really wouldn’t be able to escape punishment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Just like Mi-jun hyung said back then, it really worked out.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on actually knew about today’s reporting incident in advance. Because Hae Mi-jun had told him beforehand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the time, he himself hadn’t believed it and had reacted skeptically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s useless. Just because we report it doesn’t mean we can get Ha Gwon-yeong expelled from school. It’s also true that Ha Gwon-yeong is an A-rank healer needed for gates…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It will be useful. Trust me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Was that… what this meant?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? What was?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun looked back at Yoon Cha-on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The system kicked Ha Gwon-yeong out and put me in the gate team. The reported perpetrators are excluded from actual combat? Is that how the system rules work?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon unconsciously opened his mouth to answer…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then immediately closed it again. This wasn’t something he should butt in and interrupt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun should do it. Hae Mi-jun was the one qualified to tell Yoon Cha-on the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to Gyeon Gang-hyeon choosing silence, Hae Mi-jun’s clear voice flowed out uninterrupted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. The Hunter School system doesn’t reflect hunters’ reputations. It only looks at ability.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cha-on. The reason you were matched to a gate, beating out hunter Ha Gwon-yeong… is because your stats surpassed hunter Ha Gwon-yeong’s stats.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unlike successors, regular hunters don’t have things called skills. They can only imbue weapons with attributes to exert power beyond ordinary people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, regular hunters’ rankings tended to be determined purely by attribute abilities and physical capabilities, without skill intervention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Yoon Cha-on being listed ahead of Ha Gwon-yeong meant that despite the relative difference in attribute abilities, he had come to surpass Ha Gwon-yeong in stats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun stood with his hands clasped in front. Both hands were humbly buried in his large sleeves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even though you received power from someone insufficient like me… you’re really amazing. It’s purely the result of your effort.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on couldn’t believe what he had just heard. I surpassed Ha Gwon-yeong? Ha Gwon-yeong, an A-rank healer under Ja Hyeong-woo-nim?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I feel wronged about why once you decide on an affiliation, you can’t change it. Cha-on, you should have been under Hyeong-woo hyung’s affiliation. Then your potential wouldn’t have been wasted either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Do you really think so?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun looked up in confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was also surprised. That last comment did sound like something he would say, but he hadn’t actually opened his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The voice had come from behind Gyeon Gang-hyeon. From the training room entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he turned around, blue hwarang clothing gleamed under the lighting. Ja Hyeong-woo was standing there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, why is everyone coming? Gyeon Gang-hyeon made a sour expression at the unexpected uninvited guest, then soon realized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since this is the water attribute training room, that bastard would have gotten a notification too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mi-jun. You’re already excellent as you are. You shouldn’t be compared to me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo approached, leaving heavy footsteps on the training room floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon also inwardly agreed with what Ja Hyeong-woo said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Setting aside Yoon Cha-on’s stats, the most important attribute affinity and water abilities… Hae Mi-jun, you gave those. Because you also grew that much.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since even Ha Gwon-yeong’s supervising successor had appeared, Gyeon Gang-hyeon had even less to do. You could say his contribution was about providing rope to tie someone up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why did I come here? …Right, I came to watch.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s feet stopped in front of the bound Ha Gwon-yeong. His gaze was mercilessly fierce.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was negligent about external matters, so I didn’t know. If it weren’t for Gang-hyeon, I would never have known until the end.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  About the unjust acts of someone using me to feel superior and trampling on others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence flowed. Ja Hyeong-woo turned on the megaphone, one of the status window functions. It was a function that could transmit voice to all hunters under his affiliation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Everyone listen. I have never looked down on or spoken ill of any successor. So if this kind of thing happens again in the water attribute after today, I’ll accept that person as ignoring my existence and deal with it accordingly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the target Ja Hyeong-woo turned his head to look at was… Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who would be least related to the speech.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon unexpectedly made eye contact and hardened his expression slightly. Ja Hyeong-woo’s eye contact was long. Even after Gyeon Gang-hyeon fought back with a stare and got tired of it first, turning his eyes away, it continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, it wasn’t unrelated. Rather, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was the most central figure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had not only pointed out the regular hunters who were disparaging successor Hae Mi-jun—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had also shown anger toward hunters who had been looking down on Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t notice, it didn’t matter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After finishing his short speech, Ja Hyeong-woo personally dragged Ha Gwon-yeong out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since I have responsibility, I’ll take him. We’re going to have a three-way meeting with the association.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only three remained in the training room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on, who was still sitting down, looked back and forth between his successor Hae Mi-jun and outsider Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How should we wrap up this situation?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been standing awkwardly, was the first to speak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you see the association’s official announcement? They said they’ll create separate isolation dormitories within the school to monitor the perpetrators. Now you middle school kids can use the gym comfortably.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really? That seems like a good method.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s face sparkled particularly as he chimed in agreement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Are they close? They must be. Like that photo taken in front of Busan Gate. Yoon Cha-on watched with interest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been thinking about something, muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I should gradually move to the successor gym too. Finally finding my proper place?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The water attribute delinquents were all sorted out. Now there was no longer any reason for Gyeon Gang-hyeon to stay in the water attribute regular gym.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on almost unconsciously caught Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s attention at that moment. He almost said: You’re not coming to our gym anymore?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But in the end, he just swallowed air and was left speechless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because as soon as Hae Mi-jun heard Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words, his face lit up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please come, please! I’ve been hoping you’d keep coming this way. Then we’ll really be doing physical training together now, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you want to be with me that much?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll be disappointed. I’m doing like 15 kilos right now? Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I won’t be disappointed!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words about leaving Yoon Cha-on’s gym to come to the successor gym, Hae Mi-jun was overjoyed. His cheeks flushed red with anticipation and excitement, and his eyes sparkled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on saw all of this clearly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Hae Mi-jun acted maturely in front of him, that childlike appearance was both unfamiliar… and somehow understandable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…I see.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I have Mi-jun hyung, then Mi-jun hyung has successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The identity of scoundrel Gyeon Gang-hyeon is actually Mi-jun hyung’s…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …It should really be an unpredictable development, but somehow it’s not really.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Aiming for an empty space in the conversation, Yoon Cha-on quietly interjected. He stood up from his spot and looked up at the other person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you. Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was known to be prickly and bad-tempered, but actually Yoon Cha-on knew a secret.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That it wasn’t necessarily true.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he tried expecting a reaction to his thanks once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon looked at him intently with a somewhat cautious expression, then soon raised his finger and pointed at Yoon Cha-on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I don’t know your name. No, I heard it’s Cha-on. I don’t know who you are. So I don’t know why you’re thanking me either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun looked troubled from the side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on acted composed as if he had expected this, but loneliness briefly showed through his tightly pressed lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s not a successor like these two people, just a regular hunter nobody.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wouldn’t make sense for him to stand equally between these two people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You couldn’t know. Actually, it would be strange if you did. I was always together in the gym, but I’m a stranger to you anyway…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ugh, this really looks pathetic. What are you doing? Yoon Cha-on became embarrassed by himself after speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was thinking he should hurry back to the dormitory when.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Gyeon Gang-hyeon exclaimed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This might not be right, but are you the person who gave me a towel?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
