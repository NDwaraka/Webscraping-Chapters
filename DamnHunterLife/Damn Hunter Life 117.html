  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 117
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s nothing special of a question. I’ve heard it several times already.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a bit unexpected that even Jin Seol-woon, who thinks of Successors like office acquaintances, would ask this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m just weak.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know how many times I’ve repeated the same explanation. At this point, my mouth just plays it back automatically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “In all aspects of handling awakening abilities, if I use strength above a certain level, my insides get damaged or hurt. I’d probably be fine if I didn’t do anything. It’s because I do things that there’s a problem.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I deliberately spoke as if it were no big deal while facing Jin Seol-woon. I was afraid the other person would pity me if I avoided his eyes. That kind of thing is absolutely disgusting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m speculating that it’s aftereffects from failing awakening once, but honestly my memory of that time is hazy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since no one except the original Gang-hyeon knows the detailed inside story of that incident, I’d be in trouble if asked in detail. It’s better to dodge by saying I forgot early on before being asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon didn’t probe further or even show a stirring reaction. He just quietly opened his mouth after listening to everything I said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi is now an essential asset that can’t be missing from the Successors, and I know I’m not in a position to interfere. Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi must be taking good care of you…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was he trying to say something like whether I had to go out to stages?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing how he shut his mouth, he didn’t cross the line. But if that’s the case, he shouldn’t have brought it up at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Be careful. Be careful and careful again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pleasant voice clung to my eardrums for a long time before falling away. At the same time, the troublemaker thoughts that had been ticking in my head quietly died down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The faces of the other guys passed through my mind one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun and Won Ha-ri, who are always worried and watching my complexion. Yang Pyo and Sa Ye-ho, who seem to tease but are secretly very worried.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘These guys are really suffering from having the wrong teammate… Being distracted by worry for a sick person is absolutely not pleasant.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And now even Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And Ja Hyeong-woo…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I soon gave up thinking about it altogether.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unfortunately for Jin Seol-woon’s concerns, I was already on the roster for the very next stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monster appearing this time was speculated to be earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So they first deployed Myo Cho-hui, a wood attribute dealer who digs into earth, then filled in the remaining personnel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I seem like a side dish.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s different from when Hae Mi-jun was attached at the very end before. He’s a useful healer, and I’m what.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, the fact that they included me means I’m at least better than nothing, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve grown compared to the past when my very existence was a nuisance. Though he didn’t say it directly, Woo Sae-geon who saw the Four Divine Beasts skill seems to have judged that I have at least minimal value.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If not, killing me before retirement might have been part of Woo Sae-geon’s job. Whether socially killing me or assassinating me disguised as an accident…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyone who saw that bastard’s eyes during the match would know. Those were eyes that looked like they’d really killed a person or two. How did such a dangerous person become a hero?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No. Still, it’s better than someone like me being a hero.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eek!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not like I had that thought just because I almost slipped and fell on the mud the moment I stepped beyond the stage entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, Jin Seol-woon who was next to me rescued me. I still staggered a bit after that, when suddenly something like a solid wall appeared behind my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What could be behind me is obvious without looking.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I frowned and glanced back. Sure enough, there was Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tried to say something, but I snapped “Get lost to your position” and then linked arms with the arm Jin Seol-woon offered. It was unavoidable for proper walking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, why is this place a tidal flat? Well, mud is earth too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The higher the stage number, the more treacherous the terrain seems to become. I got suddenly angry because walking was uncomfortable. I got even more heated because everyone else was calmly walking while properly pulling out their feet that sank deep, while only I was swaying around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve never once seen the dog enter a place gallantly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah sneered with a face so arrogant it seemed to pierce the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Myo Cho-hui, who had been on the east side, suddenly jumped forward. She looked around at the scenery before her with a puzzled expression, then spoke in a bewildered voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There are no monsters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monsters that were in the preliminary information, the cute toads, had all disappeared without a trace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From Woo Sae-geon’s subtle expression, it seems he can’t feel any energy underground either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pointed to the blue water visible in the distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No wonder it’s a tidal flat. There’s what looks like a sea… no, a big lake over there. They’re not hiding in that water, are they?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe the toads were water attribute, not earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before entering the stage, there had been conflicting opinions about whether toads were water or earth. So Woo Sae-geon had arranged our combination as a 4-attribute balanced type so we could prepare regardless of the attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened the stage preliminary information again in the Status Window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What the hell is this…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who checked after me, muttered in a stiffly hardened voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems the existing monsters drowned and water ghosts were created.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had already found stages creepy given that monsters like Eodeukcseini appeared early on, and will-o’-the-wisps also appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is the first time it’s changed in the middle.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon echoed in a tense voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is a variable even Woo Sae-geon couldn’t predict. I got furious instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is really fucking unfair! Monsters should just end when they die, why do they become ghosts!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right! Where’s the common sense and conscience!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah chimed in with my words while fuming. Then our eyes met exactly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I raised the corner of my mouth in a grin. Whether it was an unconscious reaction, Ma Cheon-ah belatedly lit fire in her eyes like a wild horse. She whipped her head away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The leader’s silence didn’t last long. Woo Sae-geon soon calmly drew his twin swords and prepared to advance toward the water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whatever monsters appear, what we have to do doesn’t change. Prepare for battle. Myo Cho-hui, if you find toad corpses, you collect them.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui nodded resolutely with bright eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage viewers would be enthusiastic about how brave she is, but that’s actually because Myo Cho-hui is someone who, like Woo Sae-geon, casually passes over gory scenes or blood-soaked monster corpses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The lake was quiet without a single breeze. Under the blue surface, only clear ripples were visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But everyone knew. In reality, this lake was teeming with water ghosts trying to grab humans and drown them at any moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Someone might suddenly be grabbed and dragged into the water.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe right now they’re extending their arms to our feet, constantly waving their hands trying to grab at least our feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How do we attack ghosts we can’t see?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What if Rabbit unni uses detection skills to tell us their locations?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But we soon realized that Myo Cho-hui’s detection skill was useless here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing the energy of life is the ability of Myo Cho-hui, who possesses wood attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the opponents are already dead ghosts?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It would be the same even if Sa Ye-ho came. He finds enemies by detecting heat. Ghosts don’t have body temperature either.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s no one in the Twelve Zodiac with the ability to detect ghosts…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s when an idea occurred to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just close your eyes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We can’t see the ghosts, but there are beings close to ghosts attached near us right now, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If we switch to familiar vision and look, we’ll probably be able to see them!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like it would work if each person rode their familiar and borrowed the familiar’s vision for long-range attacks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t tested it directly, but I was confident this would work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can feel Woo Sae-geon looking at me. Is he annoyed that I came up with a useful idea first? Serves him right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then what about people without familiars?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Myo Cho-hui’s words fell, everyone looked at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m a healer so it won’t be a big problem. I’ll stay far away and just heal. However, don’t go in recklessly to attack. You can’t count on my predictive healing this time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon put one sword back in the scabbard on his left side. Though twin swords were his specialty, he seemed to plan on using only one today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, the number of swords didn’t matter. For casting earth attribute skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t let your body touch the water.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon gave a warning. Since we couldn’t enter the water directly, everyone was going to consume large amounts of skills in this stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Water ghosts can’t possibly be stronger than us, right? If we get caught, couldn’t we pull them out instead?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your arrogance will kill you someday, Ma Cheon-ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon coldly berated her. It was a statement without blood or tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah seemed shocked and kept her gaze downcast for a while. However, since it’s not easy for someone with a天上天下唯我独尊 (heaven above, earth below, I alone am honored) personality to reform, she climbed onto Chollima and soon forgot what she’d just said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow… disgusting! They’re packed so densely.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But they look like people. I wonder if they weren’t made from dead toads.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon also summoned the Dragon familiar and witnessed the swarm of water ghosts. Though Woo Sae-geon probably didn’t plan this far, the recent harsh familiar training had been helpful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But something’s strange?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why doesn’t anyone care that I also can’t bring out a familiar and can’t do anything?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah openly makes laughing sounds. Even Jin Seol-woon seemed to be faintly smiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo gestured for me to come to the back where he was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard would feel comfortable with me quietly staying next to him. But do you think I’d do that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I came all the way into a stage, so I should contribute too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I have my own thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe now is the time to reveal this skill I have to everyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t be surprised if I suddenly disappear. I actually have a stealth skill and I’m going to use it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because it was bothersome, I roughly notified the three who didn’t know about the stealth skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Boundary Between Life and Death (Earth Attribute)&gt; skill is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, now I can see the ghosts in the water too. There really are so many—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, my body stiffened completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the ghosts were simultaneously poking their faces above the water surface and staring at me.
 </span>
</p>
