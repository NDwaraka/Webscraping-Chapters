  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 15
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had told Jin Seol-woon that if he had something he was worrying about, he should just do it, but the new song recording matter was already finished. Therefore, Jin Seol-woon should have had nothing to worry about currently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But…… actually, there was something he was worried about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He just didn’t want to admit the fact that this had been seen through by Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had nothing to do with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he knew it, sleep had fled and his eyes became clear. Jin Seol-woon recalled the thoughts he hadn’t been able to find answers to even before falling asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon, how did that person know the reason I don’t sing? He’s not really my fan, and this was the first time he met me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because…… you’re someone who gave up singing, which you love, in order not to harm both the Twelve Zodiac and Innate.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I guess I have to admit it now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever purpose Gyeon Gang-hyeon had for doing this to me,
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Dog successor was cleverer than others knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For several days after that, I kept hanging around Jin Seol-woon’s residence to remind him of my existence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t easy since I had to match the little time when Jin Seol-woon wasn’t at the training ground, plus I had my own schedule.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But for that reason, there was also the effect that Jin Seol-woon’s irritation doubled from having his precious rest time disturbed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I leaned against the lobby wall and greeted him with a finger snap. Jin Seol-woon ignored me and passed by. As he always did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, today he seemed tired of pretending not to know me. Just when I thought he would leave like that, he stopped abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you want?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He still had his back turned. Jin Seol-woon wasn’t looking, but I grinned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to continue the conversation we were having a few days ago.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other person said nothing. However, he didn’t just leave either, so I could consider this tacit consent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behold my cheap efforts used to create this opportunity again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I came to see your face, you know? If I’m a fan, wouldn’t I naturally want to see my favorite idol’s face?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stubbornly pushing the fan setting that he wouldn’t even believe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you see this? Your youngest tagged you. He said he misses Esi hyung, and that he’ll work hard for hyung’s share too, so he’s cheering for hyung’s work.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You should respond to this, shouldn’t you? If you don’t, rumors will spread that Esi cut ties with Innate instead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Giving him updates on his members’ situation without being asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm hmm~ hmm hmm hmm~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blatantly playing Innate’s title song in front of him and humming along.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These three things were a great success in wearing down Jin Seol-woon’s patience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well then, let’s move on to the next step.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you say this before? That the Innate kids wanted to include your voice first, but you were the one who refused?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a truth that Jin Seol-woon had once blurted out himself, perhaps because he didn’t like his members being criticized by me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, I already knew this from the original work. But what’s more important here is what comes next.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then sing by yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it sounds like meddling or an order, I don’t care. Someone had to say this to Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually, there’s no problem blocking you. This is all something that would end if you just realized it yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy who looks like a handsome android, why does he care so much about his colleagues and public opinion?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Surprisingly, everyone thinks “Jin Seol-woon is Esi before he’s a hunter,” so nothing much would happen if he reduced training a bit and sang a little……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even I, who say this, know. Jin Seol-woon is really stubborn. No matter how much others say this for days, it’s just going in circles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why, in the original work, it takes two months for Jin Seol-woon to comfortably sing the songs he so longed for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By then, he’d lost some of his musical sense, so he was very regretful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I should have sung sooner. Music is my life, what’s a little public opinion?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know well that you’ll regret it later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there’s no way this guy would improve just because a scoundrel he’d barely met threw a tantrum for a few days……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you’re going to be like that, this side has plans too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Once I throw a curveball, what can you do?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I walked over and grabbed Jin Seol-woon’s wrist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon tried to shake me off lightly, but I was faster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Return home.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I used the return function through the status window. Jin Seol-woon, who had been grabbed by the wrist, was dragged along with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, Jin Seol-woon’s eyes widened as he unwillingly ended up inside scoundrel Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In response, I smiled with the corners of my mouth stretched like Jin Seol-woon would when giving fan service on stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Watch carefully.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Where I was was the arcade in Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s house. I had connected the large screen used for watching movies with the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The clock on the wall pointed to exactly 9 AM.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perfect. Just according to my plan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ding dong. A notification sound rang throughout the room through the speakers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the screen lit up, showing a wide table in what looked like a private office and the person sitting there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I had made an appointment in advance, as soon as the time came, I was connected to the other party via video call. I greeted first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello, Association President.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to my subtle push, Jin Seol-woon was standing outside my small screen view. He was in a position where the Association President couldn’t see him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was startled enough to make his shoulders jump at the Association President’s face that suddenly appeared, but he held onto his minimal composure and didn’t make a sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It’s nice to meet early in the morning. Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What insincere words from this old man.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it’s more than this villain-like old man deserves, since this is a meeting between a successor and the Association President anyway, I should at least exchange greetings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you for the points from before.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see Association President Kim Jae-moon’s eyebrows twitch immediately. It was funny.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m talking about that damn reporter interview from before. Since he called me to Hunter School’s central building under the pretext of points, he seemed to think he had to keep his word, and later actually gave me points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  You have received 3000 points from external sources.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Would you like to accept?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He really didn’t want to give them, Association President. That’s why I laughed so much when I received the points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Association President Kim Jae-moon. All he does is take money from broadcasters and watch the government committee members’ reactions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s decent at shoving regular hunters into gates and handling the aftermath, but he only sees successors as cash cows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having seen so much of this person’s trolling in the original work, I was just grateful no matter what trials the Association President went through because of my interview.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t do any good deeds worthy of receiving points. Well, I’ll think of it as a reward for giving good words of encouragement to the reporter.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“……Then, may I ask for what reason you requested a meeting with me?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His insides must be boiling. The Association President requested the main point in quite a polite tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced sideways and confirmed that Jin Seol-woon was looking at me without being able to move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve been thinking, and I’ve decided I should do it after all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When talking about things like this, the key is to make an expression different from your words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I made the most ’empty-headed looking face’ I could manage. Especially more cheerfully when saying the next words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Do what?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to report Hunter School to the Labor Office.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a reckless claim that was tantamount to nonsense. It was impossible to tell whether the person saying it was serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps recognizing this, the Association President also made a face like he was looking at a whining 7-year-old. And in that state, he tried to reason with me. Looking at him doing this, he seemed to want to pretend to be a logical adult.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon would be more of an adult than you.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What kind of argument is that? Officially, the recommended training hours for successors and hunters don’t exceed weekly working hours.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Aha.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the current insane training hours are just what the successors are voluntarily extending and doing themselves. Is that what you’re saying?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know about that stuff. I’m just going to spread the word far and wide. That the current amount of training for successors isn’t something humans should do. Loudly, so all the citizens of the Republic of Korea can hear.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Annoyance momentarily crossed the wrinkles under the Association President’s eyes. He smoothed the wrinkles with his fingers and spoke again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The citizens are grateful to the successors who voluntarily accepted their duties. National honor, post-retirement housing and funds, various benefits have been promised, haven’t they?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Such privileges come with a price, that’s the Association President’s argument.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Association President, who had paused briefly, then began attacking my logic itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon. You currently don’t train as a successor, so then who did you request this meeting for? ……Don’t I know that this wasn’t a meeting requested in consultation with other successors?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I couldn’t help but feel wronged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this a topic that requires consultation with the parties involved?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That my voice contained more indignation and sincerity than necessary, I eventually realized as I heard it myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But just this once, I let that emotion flow out as it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having never been an idol, I couldn’t fully understand Jin Seol-woon’s feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I could empathize through the original work, and coincidentally, because of the Association President in front of me, anger welled up and I was really pissed off. My clenched fists trembled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know if Jin Seol-woon was watching me like this or not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A kid just wants to sing and he can’t even do that? Because of watching your reactions?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
