  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 156
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The timing was so terribly coincidental that I lost my composure without realizing it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Who is it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment my mouth opened, Mungmung hurriedly hid inside me. Whether it was Squeaky or Mungmung, they never showed their true forms to others – that was the same.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The door burst open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Sa Ye-ho. The tension completely melted away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you knocking and then coming in? What kind of concept is that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expected him to giggle, but Sa Ye-ho’s expression was somehow displeased. Moreover, he swept his gaze across the room once as he entered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How would I know what kind of mischief you’re up to inside?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is he talking about?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, I’m working in here, what else would I be doing? Bewildered, I turned my attention to yesterday’s school settlement details.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to Sa Ye-ho, the fear that had dominated me until just now disappeared. As my emotions settled, I could return to daily life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The system that seems to be watching me even changing stage numbers… Ah geez, I don’t know. Let’s think about this later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho didn’t go to the sofa but immediately sat down on the edge of the desk where I was working.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I narrowed my eyes and looked up at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, still with a displeased expression, suddenly nudged my arm with his foot. It was a white bare foot without even socks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “My snake eyes skill broke.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he spat out words more ominous than his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Snake eyes skill? Why did that break?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It rotted. I saw something I shouldn’t have seen and my snake eyes rotted.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is he talking about? I looked Sa Ye-ho up and down with suspicious eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There are cases where skills themselves change, whether for better or worse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My ‘Boundary Between Life and Death’ skill was like that, and when the year changed and Yang Pyo turned 20, some of his skills were enhanced for the better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But Sa Ye-ho hasn’t had anything happen that would cause that…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how light-headed Sa Ye-ho was, he wasn’t someone who would joke about skills to me, who had become the leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But right now, to my eyes… I couldn’t feel any change in energy from Sa Ye-ho’s body. Sa Ye-ho’s fire was exactly the same as before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I was about to ask if he was mistaken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So it was when we went to support the Cheonan gate.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After building up something grand, he suddenly cut off his words and squinted his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho abruptly lifted his butt from the desk. The one step that had been soundlessly light became snake-like slithering steps the next moment. He opened the office door, looked around left and right, then closed it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is he trying to say that he’s even checking if there’s anyone outside to overhear?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who returned to my side, still stared at me intently with an expression hard to gauge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he was particularly carefully watching my reaction. As if he would catch even the slightest change in the direction of the fine hair on my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “While detecting the boss, the leader and healer disappeared and didn’t come back. Even when we made emergency contact, there was no response.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Of all people, it had to be the sunfish leader and healer who went missing, it’s inside a gate, the kids behind us are just staring blankly after doing something, I had no choice but to use my skill to find them.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, really no way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So I used my snake eyes… and your chat came belatedly. …You had the presence of mind to send a chat?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crazy, ah, really no way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if you’re at the height of boiling blood, isn’t it a bit much inside a gate? Did your head spin because you were too happy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those words were my death sentence and the sound of my life ending.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I froze like stone. I felt trapped inside stone. Sa Ye-ho was waving his hand in front of me, but the motion looked choppy and disconnected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re bright red. Can I touch you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s eyes flashed. It was the same crazed eyes I’d seen exactly once when we played the game directly like characters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho who had become a snake itself, finding this unbelievably entertaining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I just faint right here? I’m actually on the verge of fainting right now. Should I just die? That seems possible too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I can explain everything. Listen. There are circumstances.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang energy and whatnot – I’d never wanted to tell anyone even if I died, but reaching this dead end, I had to pray that Sa Ye-ho would please listen. My neck turning red, I explained the whole ordeal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Because my body was like that, I was ultimately receiving regular treatment from Ja Hyeong-woo, and the incident in the gate was an emergency situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you looked like you were enjoying it too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I finally squeezed my eyes shut. My face was so hot it was hard to keep my eyes open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With those snake eyes, what would you know? Screaming would only be digging my own grave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What if he finds me disgusting?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m supposed to be the leader, I don’t want to look defective.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, I remembered the Agni fight incident. The annoying giggling sound was vivid. When I muttered to myself about how that Agni bastard could do such a thing, Sa Ye-ho had definitely said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Such things happen in the world.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gave up on hiding my reddened face and lowered my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You said it could happen.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced up at Sa Ye-ho, but he neither particularly affirmed nor denied that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was only the goofy face he’d shown long ago when he first said he liked me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you dating?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The question was so one-dimensional and direct that I was rather speechless. It was timing when I should have smoothly deflected, but my head just froze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To say we’re not dating would make me someone who presses their lower parts together with someone they have no feelings for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To say we are dating…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That bastard thinks you’re dating.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to roughly get past it, but there was no room to escape. Sa Ye-ho managed to open those slit eyes wide and bright, showing tremendous interest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While grinning as he watched the blush spread from the edges of my cheeks again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did Ja Hyeong-woo seduce you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I nodded, meaning yes. With a slight hint of resignation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t forget to subtly imply that I was a victim who was deceived by him, and it was all because that bastard was cunning just like his looks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Heh. Would you fall just because he tries to seduce you? You must have let yourself fall.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Sa Ye-ho knew me too well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘We’ve played together too much. Should I push him away a bit?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is do or die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Thump*, Sa Ye-ho’s body, pushed obediently as I shoved, crashed onto the sofa floor. I climbed on top of Sa Ye-ho and growled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you spread rumors, know that you’ll die.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you crazy? Like I’d out you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your word choice!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I still couldn’t fully accept the fact that my first physical contact partner was a man. When I yelled, Sa Ye-ho giggled and showed surrender by raising both hands while lying down. It was a clear surrender pose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yessir, leader.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had to kick my blanket for several nights in a row.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But thanks to that, I could forget the rising anxiety.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until Stage 33 was imminent right before our eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ***
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about the dangerous stage, and being flustered because of Sa Ye-ho, Gyeon Gang-hyeon hadn’t had his mind together at all lately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon, this time please don’t postpone it—”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I understand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, he received a talk show schedule.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was his first private broadcast since becoming leader. He’d been putting it off day after day, but for some reason, Gang-hyeon accepted it right before the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Standing at the center of the talk show, he seemed a bit more serious than before, but didn’t look gloomy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere continued flowing cheerfully and informally, surrounding Gang-hyeon as the leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon, I heard you’ve recently received modeling offers from various brands after retirement! Is that true?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had improved his image by transforming his irritable personality into charm. Broadcasting officials also began to notice his other talent – his power in front of cameras. And most importantly, Gang-hyeon was easier to send proposals to than Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon answered cleverly even to the sudden question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They looked favorably on me, but honestly I don’t really know why. I recommend Ye-ho instead of me. He’ll shoot amazingly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “As if you don’t know the reason.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Jin Seol-woon spoke up. As soon as Jin Seol-woon opened his mouth, the camera focus turned precisely to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t know how highly I regard Gyeon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Words that would make fans stir again were thrown out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon returned to being an actor when the talk show started. He spoke with Gang-hyeon naturally as if nothing had happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though his insides were burning up without anyone knowing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘After telling me to make time for him too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He found himself so pathetic he couldn’t stand it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had wanted to confess properly. But every time he tried to choose what to say, his thoughts scattered repeatedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Knowing the outcome already, he felt afraid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever he said, it would be the last time with Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s devastated expression looking at him in that dark room painfully flickered before his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He felt like he would see that face again. Like his words would disturb him once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon briefly closed his eyes then opened them to calm his surging emotions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He opened his eyes and observed the space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  True to the public evaluation that he was still cold toward Ja Hyeong-woo, Gang-hyeon was now sitting very far from Ja Hyeong-woo. Almost at opposite ends.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But in the round semicircular panel, that position was also the best spot to gaze directly at Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon watched Gang-hyeon with lingering attachment while being conscious of Ja Hyeong-woo’s presence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Doing so, he could also vaguely read what Gang-hyeon was thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This talk show taking place right before the stage was a buffer before Gang-hyeon threw a big stone into the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few days later, there was an association announcement. Gang-hyeon spoke directly in front of cameras. As the leader of the successors, staking his face on it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We will stop stage broadcasting. From now on, only the strategy results will be disclosed, and after association review, we plan to discuss whether to release edited recordings of some key scenes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He declared his refusal of stage broadcast transmission, and that whatever situations occurred inside, all of it would be made into matters for successors only.
 </span>
