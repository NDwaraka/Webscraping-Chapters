  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 90

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon ran down the corridor, got straight into the elevator, pressed the first floor and repeatedly hit the close button.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t follow any further. There was also no attempt to catch him by sending text messages or chatting on his phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, I should have said that it’s all past business so it’s fine now, don’t worry about it before leaving…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He regretted the words he hadn’t finished saying, but since he was the one who cut off the conversation and ran away, he couldn’t go back. Gyeon Gang-hyeon crouched down in the elevator with an aching headache.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, I’m glad Ja Hyeong-woo still doesn’t approach me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, he had been nervous. After allowing the embrace in the gate, he worried that Ja Hyeong-woo might mistake this as Gyeon Gang-hyeon becoming lenient and cling to him like when they were children.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that didn’t happen, and their relationship remained exactly the same as before. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s continued nitpicking at Ja Hyeong-woo’s various aspects probably contributed to that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But somehow…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It didn’t feel as refreshing and relieving as he had expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when the elevator door opened, Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t get off and kicked the ground with his shoes, wrapped in an unpleasantness he couldn’t understand himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Could it be that Ja Hyeong-woo unexpectedly doesn’t dwell much on the past? When we were young, he followed me around so much…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crazy. What am I thinking? Is this excessive self-consciousness? Embarrassed by himself, he punched the elevator wall with his fist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he grabbed his hand because it stung, and soon forgot what he had been thinking about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Phew.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once Gyeon Gang-hyeon completely disappeared from sight, Ja Hyeong-woo let out a sigh as if his energy had completely drained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I had known in advance that his parents had passed away, I could have been more…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His heart burned with regret that came too late. If it was during first year of middle school, it would have been just one year since contact was lost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he couldn’t contact him because he was severely shocked by that…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Ja Hyeong-woo soon looked at himself with a dry attitude. Then he reminded himself of a bitter truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t been that important to Gyeon Gang-hyeon in the first place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His heart-wrenching feelings toward him weren’t valued by the other party to that extent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was used to this kind of thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I feel like I can never let go of these feelings even if I die, I should try to get closer to Gang-hyeon…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as Gyeon Gang-hyeon was secretly relieved, Ja Hyeong-woo hadn’t made any non-work-related contact with Gyeon Gang-hyeon recently. The exception was when he got carried away last time and brought him home to eat together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the reason he acted this way existed in a realm Gyeon Gang-hyeon could never know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Just being next to him makes me have improper fantasies.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about it again, he shouldn’t have undressed Gyeon Gang-hyeon and done such things that night out of anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he had known that the scene of that white skin flushing red would come to mind several times a day and scatter his concentration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while his head was stuffy from hearing about his parents, his body faithfully recognized the presence before his eyes. Just seeing the white traditional clothes’ ties swaying made an eerie excitement build in his stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How difficult it was during that broadcast too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Washing powerless Gyeon Gang-hyeon vs. Powerful…]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He almost really asked the host this: ‘What are you thinking, sexually harassing successors?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The harassment toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon was done by his own imagination while answering that question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He still doesn’t know what state of mind he was in when eating together last time. That’s also why he more diligently and quickly emptied his tray.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then Gang-hyeon stared at me so much.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was he dumbfounded, wondering if a beggar had entered his stomach?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be fortunate if only a beggar had entered. Because that disgusting thing called sexual desire was also in there. Whenever Gyeon Gang-hyeon shook his hair and his scent drifted over, strength would immediately gather below his waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was certain was that he must never bring Gyeon Gang-hyeon to his house again. He felt like he would cross the line and come to despise himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No, it’s already despicable.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he felt stimulation from just a part that separated from Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He realized when he first heard the music Gyeon Gang-hyeon recorded. How base a human he was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The voice is a little different. Softer, but… someone else modified it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, it sounded like Gang-hyeon whispering directly in his ear, and that bright voice was so happy to listen to. He savored that song as if licking it thoroughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even searched the internet for how to use video editing software. He extracted only Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s voice from the cheer song. It took five hours just to learn the terminology and a whole week of work, but he was satisfied with the result.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hated having other voices attached next to it. Especially the chorus parts made him furrow his brow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone else was mixing with Gang-hyeon, so there was no way he could remain calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…I’m more ugly now than in childhood. At least I was young then.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything visible, everything that made up Gyeon Gang-hyeon bewitched him, creating too many things worthy of divine wrath. Sensations where it suddenly got hot below and blood seemed to rush there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t wish for Gang-hyeon’s yang energy to drop soon because I want to do it once more.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon would be horrified if he knew this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he said he wanted to date, he’d never want to see him again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he said he’d always liked him, he’d deny him completely, throwing even childhood memories into the trash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he was forcibly suppressing his emotions as if he might get indigestion…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon after, when Gyeon Gang-hyeon came to him with this kind of talk, Ja Hyeong-woo’s mind could only go completely blank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yin people and yang people can combine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he called him alone to say this, just the two of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A house completely resembles its owner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that sense, Sa Ye-ho’s house was in a word the incarnation of materialism, an explosion of greed. The garden was lined with stately trees like an arboretum, and the house was also full of all sorts of miscellaneous items.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to have some sense of arrangement, but there was so much stuff it was hard to look at properly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The large and small dartboards occupying all the walls also contributed to this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire house was practically a dart arena. Instead of being lazy about training, Sa Ye-ho consistently practiced throwing even in daily life (probably because this was fun), but just hitting targets that were always in one place was of no help in actual combat…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why does this crazy bastard have a pump at home?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He did it while stepping on a pump.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Colorful arrows quickly went up on the pump machine screen. Thump thump thump, every time Sa Ye-ho excitedly moved his legs, effects popped on the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hoit. Yap!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he let go of the railing and threw darts toward the side wall by the bathroom. Thak, thatak! Several stuck simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You train so solemnly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you. Want to pump too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Want to die?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, that’s an inferiority complex. I could just politely ask if you want to try.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I raised my middle finger for Sa Ye-ho to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I plopped down on the sofa holding the warm large needle infused with fire energy that Sa Ye-ho had given me earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These days, whenever I have spare energy, I’m researching fusion skills with other attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve now completed tests on three attributes total. Hae Mi-jun helped with water attribute, Won Ha-ri with metal attribute, and Sa Ye-ho with fire attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only wood attribute user Myo Cho-hui… I don’t know. Will I be able to receive her power once before I die?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I came here now to get Sa Ye-ho’s fire attribute. I definitely didn’t come to play.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The skill fusion work itself is going smoothly, but there’s something strange.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire and metal attributes clearly have no superiority or inferiority, but strangely, fusing attributes with Sa Ye-ho was easier than attribute fusion with Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, even though they’re both water attributes, arrows mixed with Hae Mi-jun’s power were stronger than arrows shot with Ja Hyeong-woo’s talismans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The latter is especially suspicious. If Ja Hyeong-woo is stronger than Hae Mi-jun, naturally the fusion result should also be stronger on Ja Hyeong-woo’s side, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There might be some kind of rule…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For several weeks of pondering and trying this and that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then it suddenly occurred to me. The fact that the original work’s title was &lt;Hunters Who Achieve Harmony&gt;.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Harmony. Harmony?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could this be it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, what is snake among yin and yang in the twelve zodiac?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted loudly at the back of Sa Ye-ho’s head, who was absorbed in pumping. Sa Ye-ho answered without stopping his feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Probably yin? But why? Does that matter?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just searched the internet for the yin and yang of the twelve zodiac. Soon the classification of the 12 animals appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…That’s right.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who fused well and who didn’t. This differed according to whether yin and yang matched or not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Upon realizing the truth, I got slight goosebumps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wanting to conduct a full-scale experiment according to the newly discovered principle, I called out Ja Hyeong-woo. To any meeting room in the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So this method you thought of to amplify our skills with your ability.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo sat down and got straight to the point. I began explaining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “In a way it’s natural, but it seems you guys haven’t thought of it yet. Our abilities follow the five elements, right? Then there should be yin and yang.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was an idea that didn’t appear in the original work. Therefore, I am now, on one hand, trying to change the original work in a better direction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yin people and yang people can combine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clatter, the table he was sitting at suddenly shook.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wondering what it was, I looked down but there were only his legs.
 </span>
</p>
