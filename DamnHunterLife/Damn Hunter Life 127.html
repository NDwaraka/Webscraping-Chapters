<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after the suspicions about the current leader’s tattoo were cleared up, the earth attribute training ground was still bustling with commotion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s voice was the loudest and most boisterous among them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okay fine, let’s say hiding the tattoo was because he was thinking about broadcast mosaics and stuff. But why did he choose a scholar concept?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s wrong with being a scholar? It suits him fucking well, doesn’t it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s too different from the tattoo! Is Woo Sae-geon a pervert? Does he get thrills from living a double life?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Gyeon Gang-hyeon was viciously attacking someone who wasn’t even there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside the office of the central building, it was quiet without even the sound of breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, sitting at his desk, was lost in deep thought with his usual expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t bother to explain about the tattoo with his own mouth. This created anxiety among the young successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this incident was also a kind of experiment that Woo Sae-geon had planned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When I, as the person in charge, create suspicion and anxiety among the young successors, who will they gather around and who will they depend on?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They all flocked to Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Like chicks seeking their mother’s embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Had they forgotten what kind of person Gyeon Gang-hyeon was until this spring? Or had Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s actions up until now erased all of that from their minds?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Sa Ye-ho also follows Gyeon Gang-hyeon quite well.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During the last filming, when Gyeon Gang-hyeon dared to conspire with Sa Ye-ho to lift him up from the sun bed…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon didn’t bother to stop it. He showed leniency to Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in that moment, he thought that the time when fear politics was no longer necessary had come.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The foundation has all been laid.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than elevating Ja Hyeong-woo, who was as intimidating as himself, as the next leader to continue the rigid and oppressive atmosphere… perhaps now was the time when ‘affinity’ was more needed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When his thoughts reached that point, Woo Sae-geon slightly furrowed his brow. A “tch” sound came from his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If only Ja Hyeong-woo hadn’t lost his touch in the first place.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the stage, Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t give him sufficient healing. And that was undoubtedly because he was startled and lost focus seeing Gyeon Gang-hyeon getting crushed by the fireball.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader! Ja Hyeong-woo’s healing amount is insufficient!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy who always stands one step back with the excuse of being weak, but actually grasps the entire situation and immediately points out when something’s wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon rubbed his eye area with his knuckles once and opened the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even at the end of his reign, work always poured in. The most important among them was the handover to the next person in charge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  “Those who are 20 years old or older this year.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the screen showed people who were over 20 this year, one by one in zodiac order. Ja Hyeong-woo, Myo Cho-hui, Sa Ye-ho, Jin Seol-woon—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The artificial intelligence Status Window, which collects not only school information but all internal and external public opinion, asked a question he hadn’t given.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s answer was concise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Include him.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The list of voting candidates with five people including Gyeon Gang-hyeon soon spread throughout the entire school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter where you looked around campus, students’ murmuring never ceased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How can someone as frivolous as Gyeon Gang-hyeon be a leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, maybe he’s just included for formality. We’re not going to vote for him anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do votes just roll around like that? Does it make sense to just put him in because it’s boring? The possibility of Gyeon Gang-hyeon actually becoming leader isn’t 0 percent either. That’s what voting is!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, even if all the students’ shock were combined, it wouldn’t surpass the magnitude of shock the person in question received.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye, Ye-ho…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That evening, Sa Ye-ho, who was holding a game console and going beep-beep, faced the zombie-like face of Gyeon Gang-hyeon creeping in through his house window. With a pale face as if he’d seen a ghost somewhere, he suddenly hugged Sa Ye-ho and said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m seeing things. My name is on the candidate list. They say it’s not an error. Why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s lost his mind. Sa Ye-ho suppressed his laughter and gently patted Gyeon Gang-hyeon while throwing a bomb into the burning house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If there’s a successor vote, I’ll have to vote for Gang-hyeon~”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah fuck, are you crazy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The honey-sweet reaction Sa Ye-ho had been hoping for immediately popped out, which was satisfying, but he didn’t know Gang-hyeon would be several times more shocked than that. As if he might collapse right then and there, the blood drained completely from his already white face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you distinguish between when I’m joking and when I’m not? How can such nonsense come out of your mouth? Is there no one else in the world to be leader that they’d make me leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A face burning with anger was thrust in front of Sa Ye-ho’s eyes. Sa Ye-ho, who had been staring blankly, soon burst into a hollow laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A bit annoying, and funny in the midst of it all. It was absurd that Gyeon Gang-hyeon couldn’t grasp reality even at this point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, really? You’re serious but I spoke like it was a joke, so sorry. Then shall I speak properly without joking?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho straightened his upper body that had been supporting Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s weight. Then Gyeon Gang-hyeon leaned backward. Sa Ye-ho, who had instantly reversed the situation, clearly pointed out the facts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sae-geon hyung is kinda looking at you as the next leader. Why do you think your name got on the candidate list for no reason?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon blinked several times. His long eyelashes fluttered anxiously, filled with unease.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Me, why…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was swept by the urge to gather Won Ha-ri, Hae Mi-jun, or anyone here as a group and have them beat some sense into this guy with fact violence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knew Gyeon Gang-hyeon had been living in some strange delusion about being a delinquent or whatever, but seeing the reality, wasn’t it more serious?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An expression as if he’d lost a country slowly appeared on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face. Gyeon Gang-hyeon stammered out excuse-like words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m, I’m… the Twelve Zodiac villain, right? I used to be a drunk, and now I’m human scum who only says things I shouldn’t?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho let out another hollow laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed smart yet strangely trapped in his own world. Right now that innocent look was reaching its absolute peak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, should I ask the kids about that? Ha-ri, Mi-jun, Seol-woon, all of them? Want to see what they’ll answer?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, no…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon stuttered and immediately lowered his tail.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing his lack of confidence in his words, it seemed his objective perspective was slowly opening, but he still wanted to deny it in a corner of his heart as he shook his head and plopped down on the floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you have a long tail, it gets stepped on. Gyeon Gang-hyeon was really sloppy. After helping others here and there, did he think no one would know if he just spoke cleverly? It was more amazing that he truly believed that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked down at him warmly and casually threw out a comment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re similar to Sae-geon hyung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he should have heard unspeakable curses immediately, Sa Ye-ho’s thoughts didn’t waver. He had no intention of revising his impression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So… that’s why his eyes had quickly gone to the changed Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s not easy to have big secrets in Hunter School where area CCTV is robust, stories about the leader candidates quickly leaked outside the school as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if he was just a candidate, the fact remained that a future where Gyeon Gang-hyeon, the Twelve Zodiac’s weak constitution and controversial figure, becoming leader had been discussed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A tanker in name only who couldn’t tank. A familiar that couldn’t be used well even when present due to internal injuries. A body that couldn’t stand at the forefront as a leader even if he became one. The stamina controversy again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What good would fusion skills do when the disadvantages were much more prominent?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And past mistakes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The harsh words he’d spouted to students while drunk, or photos of him crouched and lying on the campus ground resurfaced. Topics about Gyeon Gang-hyeon circulated hotly around the internet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Sigh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok sighed at the internet boards filled with bitter words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘These are things I used to see every day before, so they’re not particularly surprising, but what had been well-forgotten is now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok, manager of Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon, resolved that this time he would have to bring out the truth he had buried before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The call records of Gang-hyeon-nim crying and appealing his pain, the remote medical consultation records…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t certain yet. Since no official announcement had been made, this leader position might end up going to Ja Hyeong-woo without incident after all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, if a reversal occurred, Park Yoon-seok was prepared to block the fierce criticism that would be poured on his successor with what he had, based on his belief that his successor could do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even while making that resolution, he thought there probably wouldn’t be a need to go against Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s will…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The other successors will probably support Gang-hyeon-nim—’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash! Suddenly the sound of a cup breaking echoed through the office where Park Yoon-seok was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Th-this—!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not caring about the glass shards scattered on the floor, a man was trembling and showing the whites of his eyes. What was happening?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who… who spread this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was Woo Sae-geon’s assigned manager.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok first moved the man who had lost his reason away from the glass shards, then looked down at the monitor screen he’d been looking at.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Real-time hot news. Dozens of article headlines filled the screen.
