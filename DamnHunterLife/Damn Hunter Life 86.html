 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I have a question. Why didn’t the system create a teleportation function to the cafeteria? Depending on the person, it might be used more than the home return function, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The path trudging to the cafeteria was dazzling. I had to squint because of the stinging, strong sunlight that seemed intent on disinfecting the entire road with UV rays.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And it’s inside a gate anyway, so what’s the point of implementing South Korea’s ozone layer as is?”
 </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, it’s because of vicious beings like you, Status Window. …Come to think of it, what exactly are you, Status Window? Sa Ye-ho says you always claim to be an AI when he asks. Is that true?”
 </span>
</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Huh. I haven’t heard that kind of answer before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I feel like my eyes will go blind from the sunlight if I stay here a bit longer. I was walking with my eyes almost closed when suddenly cool shade fell from above.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had suddenly appeared, was tilting his parasol toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing carrying something like this around?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t get tanned.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under the faint shade, Jin Seol-woon’s skin glowed softly. Even without any makeup, Jin Seol-woon’s features always gave me the impression of being gorgeous whenever I looked at them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Want to have lunch together?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An absurd suggestion popped out from that very face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m supposed to eat with Hae Mi-jun?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Then what about dinner today?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Probably Sa Ye-ho?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tomorrow?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s his scheme? I couldn’t read any ulterior motive from his black ocean-like eyes. I felt an ominous feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did I do wrong?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Nothing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then that’s settled.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly escaped from under the parasol. Jin Seol-woon caught up immediately with his longer legs and covered me with the parasol again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you refusing? What’s the reason?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because it’s bothersome.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think I’ve heard that excuse before.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What are you trying to say now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Realizing I couldn’t shake off Jin Seol-woon with speed, I just reduced my stride. Jin Seol-woon tilted the parasol closer and persistently looked into my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you occasionally come to my house and eat together? I could go to your place too. I’ve always lived alone, so now I’m getting lonely.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey. That’s because you ostracized the world. And out of all the places to escape your corner, you chose me? Should I introduce you to someone else? Hae Mi-jun is nice.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t need anyone other than Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My slowing steps came to an abrupt halt. Jin Seol-woon stopped following suit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My face must have been full of suspicion. Jin Seol-woon gave a very long bullshit explanation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t worry. No one will know we ate together. Even what we’re doing on the street right now, they’ll just think we have something to discuss. We just need to secretly come and go from each other’s houses. Just like Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi used to do.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice is particularly gentle and sweet, like when singing. Since he’s deliberately whispering low, it somehow felt ticklish to listen to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whatever…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, at this point, would there be much difference if one more bothersome guy increased?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Hae Mi-jun, Yang Pyo, Sa Ye-ho, and Won Ha-ri are already invading my precious meal times. What’s one more person added to that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s fine since it’s not Ja Hyeong-woo. If it were Ja Hyeong-woo, that would be troublesome.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even though the conversation ended, Jin Seol-woon was still walking beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why do you keep following me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “To escort you so Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi doesn’t collapse from heat stroke and make the news.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When we arrived in front of the cafeteria, regular students saw me and Jin Seol-woon and were startled. Students going in and out of the entrance parted to both sides like the Red Sea, creating a large space in the middle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon left me behind and departed as if his real purpose had been to escort me to the cafeteria.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it was strange. Even though Jin Seol-woon retreated and I was left alone in that spot, the students’ gazes didn’t seem as sharp anymore. It might be my imagination though.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While waiting for Hae Mi-jun running from over there, I pondered Jin Seol-woon’s intentions until the last moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What benefit does he get from eating with me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Ah, I got it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now that we’ve even done music recording together, I’ve become like a community of shared fate with him, so he’s monitoring me closely in case I do something stupid again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he says my image has improved and whatnot, he’s ultimately anxious. Considering how much Jin Seol-woon has to lose, that’s understandable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi’s ideal type?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A question Jin Seol-woon slipped in among light daily conversation while walking to the cafeteria.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to the parasol blocking the sunlight, Gyeon Gang-hyeon fluttered his eyelashes more easily than before. His expression, drowsy from the sunshine, responded without much suspicion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Where would such a thing exist? What woman’s fate would I want to ruin?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hmm… Jin Seol-woon quickly turned his head inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had already expected this level of lukewarm reaction. Nevertheless, he pressed once more to try to extract what he could get.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Still, if there’s an ideal image you think of?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t know. There isn’t. …But do you know any of Woo Sae-geon’s weaknesses?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He failed to obtain information. He was even ignored. The question from just now completely disappeared from that small, round head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon briefly turned his head so Gyeon Gang-hyeon couldn’t see and swallowed his laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, the wall was high.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Having to seduce a man who doesn’t see men as romantic partners…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he won’t tell me his preferred female type, there’s no reference manual. It wasn’t even certain whether he wouldn’t reject same-sex romance in the first place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after escorting Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Jin Seol-woon stood at a distance for a while, quietly watching him meet Hae Mi-jun in front of the cafeteria.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had run over, caught his breath lightly while giggling. Gyeon Gang-hyeon chuckled and put his hand into the hair of the head below him, ruffling it. Then Hae Mi-jun’s face flushed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Jin Seol-woon’s eyes curved as if trembling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is really difficult… it feels like the whole world is competition.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words he muttered to himself tasted bitter.
 </span>
</p>

  Successor Training Ground—Integrated Training Ground

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today there’s a full successor assembly in the afternoon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throughout lunch, Hae Mi-jun looked particularly happy today. Is it because he can train with me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Integrated training for all attributes led by Woo Sae-geon. Running simulations assuming stage situations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was group training of successors, one of the things South Korean people would most want to see if they could peek into Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I went in without being late, but the training ground was already in full swing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Familiars were roaming around as if the gymnasium-sized indoor space had become a zoo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ma Cheon-ah! I told you to watch the dragon familiar’s movement!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the middle of it all, Woo Sae-geon was shouting sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Oh… I should stay quiet.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like a latecomer, I quietly went in, spread out a cushion, and sat in a corner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A proper scoundrel must always carefully observe where to stretch their legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this place where various attribute attacks were flying around, one wrong word could result in suffering from someone’s emotional control failure (intentional).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage 35 to be conducted in the near future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, Myo Cho-hui, Jin Seol-woon, Yang Pyo, and Ma Cheon-ah, scheduled as the conquest team, were in intense training under Woo Sae-geon’s supervision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since people with immediate important business were rehearsing…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They made me sit nearby to watch and learn, but actually I have nothing to do.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I’ll take this opportunity to slack off more diligently than anyone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun and Won Ha-ri were quietly doing individual training with VR on one side. I chatted with Sa Ye-ho, who was near Woo Sae-geon, from afar via messaging.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fire was only across the river and the rest was peaceful time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep—. Beep—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If not for the sudden warning notification, this peace probably would have continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The notification rang from all successors’ status windows, but the decision-making power belonged to the leader anyway. So while Woo Sae-geon fixed his gaze in the air and read the content, everyone just stared blankly at Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Woo Sae-geon sharply turned his chin and headed straight for the exit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, follow me right now. It’s an external gate matter. Myo Cho-hui will continue training.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  White scholar’s robe hem and black Hwarang uniform fluttered and disappeared from the doorway in sequence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the two disappeared, Sa Ye-ho came toward me. Avoiding vines spreading here and there, he smoothly climbed the wall and plopped down on the bench next to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally turning off chat and speaking out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What showed up in the news?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. Like this. Want me to read it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who quickly found real-time gate breaking news on his phone, read with unnecessarily good diction, perhaps due to his broadcasting experience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Today at 2:40 PM, so about 5 minutes ago, a Hunter School student’s parent tried to see their child’s face before entering conquest at the gate entrance. When the child became visible, the parent ran into the line despite monsters being present and was exposed to danger. During rescue, 21-year-old Hunter Kim×× suffered serious abdominal injuries. The civilian parent is safe, but Hunter Kim×× is currently in critical condition and requesting support from healing-type hunters. It’s not a conquest issue but a civilian accident. Ja Hyeong-woo seems to have gone to heal this—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, a long green form came swooshing toward my eyes with tremendous wind!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something vine-like came under my knees and below my right armpit. I screamed at the sensation of my body floating up in the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Uh… I dodged? I thought my side would be pierced.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I mistook for a vine was Sa Ye-ho’s arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it happened suddenly in the training ground, my mind was dazed from the accident. It was even more so because the sight of vines spread all over my vision, as if cursed by green plants.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being held by Sa Ye-ho, I looked down to see exactly how I ended up in this state.
 </span>
