  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 78
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bustling presence of unfamiliar children made Hyeong-woo even more withdrawn. Hyeong-woo remained seated at his desk with his head deeply bowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When his female deskmate glanced at him with anxious looks, then asked the homeroom teacher to change her seat to the front claiming she couldn’t see the blackboard, he became even more intimidated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that sense, the fact that Cheon and Han’s attendance numbers were similar became another stroke of luck for Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon and his seats were side by side, front and back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “20 points on dictation? Why are you so bad at it? Rewrite the wrong ones.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though there were 30 more peers in one class, Hyeong-woo’s school life couldn’t function without Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stupid, you got it wrong! Hey… I’m throwing away the colored paper! Fold this part so it sticks out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When it came to Gang-hyeon, being called stupid didn’t hurt his feelings at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why aren’t you singing along?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t sing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, even if you get it wrong, no one will know, right? Just sing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, look, look. Look at me. I’ll sing it all wrong once. The kids’ voices are loud, so you really can’t hear. Keep looking at me, okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Holding his pencil case like a microphone and swaying his body while singing with passion, not a single note was right. But it seemed only his deskmate next to him, who was looking at Gang-hyeon in bewilderment, and Hyeong-woo behind him could hear it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s words were true. The other kids really didn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only he could clear up his deskmate’s misunderstanding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cheon Gang-hyeon sings terribly…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m doing it on purpose! Don’t you know it’s harder to get it wrong deliberately?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you getting it wrong on purpose?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh… to confuse you!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A smile naturally spread across Hyeong-woo’s lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Boys this age would tease relentlessly, calling it “○○’s wife” whenever a girl got even slightly close to any boy. Because of this, there were always loud “No!” exchanges and fierce fights.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the eyes of boys looking for someone to tease, Gang-hyeon, who didn’t even go to the playground and looked after Hyeong-woo, caught their attention. They had already been frequently teasing Gang-hyeon for looking like a girl with his pretty face. The boys who found a new target laughed loudly enough to shake the classroom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cheon Gang-hyeon is Han Hyeong-woo’s wife!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo was startled and dropped his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The laughter filling the classroom seemed to be directed at him. Moreover, calling a boy someone’s wife was the ultimate humiliation, wasn’t it? He felt so sorry for Hyeon-i. It was the moment Hyeong-woo was fidgeting with his feet under the desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon shot up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, who’s going to marry you guys later? Han Hyeong-woo, I’ll at least be his wife. From what I see, no girls will marry you guys.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The girls burst into giggles. The atmosphere completely shifted to Gang-hyeon in an instant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boys were speechless and just trembling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey you little, Cheon Gang-hyeon, do you want to die?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, are you crying? Are you crying?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Pfft…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo turned his head and secretly laughed. His heart was pounding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeon-i looked so cool.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon got along well with everyone. But in the small society called school, there weren’t only Gang-hyeon’s friends.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Doesn’t Cheon Gang-hyeon act too big? Should we step on him?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo, who was returning from submitting supplementary homework to the staff room, stopped when he heard someone whispering in the bathroom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No way. That kid has backing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Backing? Does Cheon Gang-hyeon have an older brother?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, same grade. Don’t you know Han Hyeong-woo? That tall nerd.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crazy, him? His class always wins at tug-of-war.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …If I’m big, it’s good for Hyeon-i. Hyeong-woo clenched his fists tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s when it started. Hyeong-woo began looking up sports-related books in the school library and starting training that no one had asked him to do, filling water bottles to the brim.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re going to play soccer for our class. I’ll teach you the rules.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was magic-like power in Gang-hyeon’s voice. What Gang-hyeon said always came true. When Gang-hyeon told Hyeong-woo he could do it, it really happened that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, who’s that? He’s so fast.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s that kid’s name in class 3? He scored three goals alone, that’s crazy!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, class 3 is going to win at soccer…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo was bewildered even after sweeping the playground himself. He was amazed that he too could receive the kids’ cheers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boys from his class who had been hesitantly glancing at Hyeong-woo gradually began calling to Hyeong-woo far across the playground. And before he knew it, they were shouting things like “Pass to Hyeong-woo!” and including Hyeong-woo among them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon didn’t play soccer but was mixed in with the cheering girls. When Hyeong-woo briefly passed by, he heard Gang-hyeon boasting proudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeong-woo went out instead of me. You guys didn’t know, right? Hyeong-woo won our class’s tug-of-war too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He liked it even when Hyeong-woo’s achievements were bragged about as if Gang-hyeon had done them. Rather, he hoped Hyeon-i would be even more proud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You did do it. It’s all you.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon had changed Hyeong-woo’s life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Hyeong-woo was gradually, slowly but steadily blending in among the children… Gang-hyeon also began hanging out with other groups.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the grade changed and classes were separated, it would have been natural if it was natural.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the worried looks he occasionally gave Hyeong-woo disappeared, maybe he was relieved thinking ‘now it’s okay.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo knew how much Gang-hyeon had been tied to him during that time. His slightly matured heart thought they should let go now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after Gang-hyeon suggested playing together first would he approach Gang-hyeon that one time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even as his head grew bigger and the world expanded, seeing Cheon Gang-hyeon still made his heart race and flutter for no reason, so apparently he was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Around the time they entered middle school, Cheon Gang-hyeon moved to Seoul following his father’s transfer to the head office.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Contact me when you’ve adjusted? Don’t forget me just because I’m out of sight.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo couldn’t forget the smile on his lips as he patted his shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s how Cheon Gang-hyeon disappeared from sight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No contact came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when he contacted first, there was no answer. The number seemed to have changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as connections naturally are, they seemed to have naturally grown apart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a memory that was big and long only for Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a child who had grown up trouble-free like Gang-hyeon, childhood only serves as background. The past doesn’t hold back someone who has become an adult.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only Han Hyeong-woo remained in that place, drawing the back of the distant Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To meet again someday.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Maybe it was actually me who was wandering inside the hallucination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after my vision returned to normal, my recognition was slow. I just blinked like waking from a long sleep, then looked down at my left hand that was somehow caught.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I raised my head, all the wind surrounding me stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By the quiet, deep eyes in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon left, and news was cut off like blurred memories.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo continued to think of and remember him, and they met again in the strange and mysterious space called Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although the situation of suddenly becoming a hunter was vague, it couldn’t compare to the joy of meeting Gang-hyeon again. However.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Gang-hyeon must have disappointed Ja Hyeong-woo again.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think I understand why the original Ja Hyeong-woo had better abilities than the current Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who lost something important in life, had to cling to becoming a hero.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The novel really didn’t describe psychology at all. Compared to Ja Hyeong-woo’s real psychology, even the mentions of Gang-hyeon that did appear were rather few.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because it couldn’t describe Ja Hyeong-woo’s feelings of losing Gang-hyeon. Because it was indescribable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t just a mission to save the world. Ja Hyeong-woo really thinks about Gang-hyeon a lot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was wrong of me to think of separating Ja Hyeong-woo and me just because I’m not the real Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was just one of my life from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I won’t die. And I won’t disappear without saying anything either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Focus returned to Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gaze lengthened. He didn’t ask anything, nor did he seek any changes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While sending persistent looks as if wanting something from me, he also seemed powerless as if he would enter the fantasy again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my mouth as if devoured by hallucinations myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest contracted. There was a sound of a long exhale escaping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you want to show sincerity in your apology… don’t push me away.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was pulled into a tight embrace in just one step.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensation of my whole body being buried wasn’t bad. There was only a sense of obligation that I should feel bad about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Another person’s heart beats fiercely near my collarbone. Different body temperatures transfer to the same temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I relaxed my strength and closed my eyes, trying to handle Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now treat where you cut yourself with glass, stop being stubborn. At my casually mentioned words, Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly took off his upper body clothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So you can see directly and be relieved.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He took off the back of his hwarang clothes and unbuttoned the black jeoksam worn underneath. When the bandages were completely unwound, his tanned bare skin was revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when I tried to properly examine the wound, Ja Hyeong-woo preemptively covered it with his hand. Blue light leaked through his fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He tells me to check, so I’m checking, but… there was nowhere to look.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What do you do to get this big?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It looked like muscle chunks were attached piece by piece onto a huge skeleton. I looked at the two largest chunks in front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you take steroids?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? What’s that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Never mind. Just put your clothes back on.”
 </span>
</p>
