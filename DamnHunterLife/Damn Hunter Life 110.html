  ‘Translation Result’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  All hunters, regardless of nationality, have five attributes from nature. While their abilities and levels may vary, hunters’ positions are the same.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  However, Korea has the peculiarity of having 12 superior leaders. Ah, though it’s only 10 for now.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Anyway, what’s surprising is that when these 10 people were entered, the global system also produced the alias ‘Twelve Zodiac Successors.’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  You mean ‘Twelve Zodiac Successors’ wasn’t a setting created for marketing in Korea, but information that was registered in the system from the beginning? How curious. Do you have more detailed information?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  I couldn’t obtain any other information.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  When I looked into the ‘Twelve Zodiac’ theory, it’s not just a story that works in Korea, but a theory spread throughout the East. But why was only Korea chosen among them?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The system created the Twelve Zodiac Successors…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suppose that makes sense. All the familiars have animal forms too. Still, hearing it directly from an association person felt different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But in the end, those people don’t know the exact reason we’re called successors either, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems even the World Hunter Association can’t help with information the system doesn’t disclose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, there wasn’t much gain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just got an eerie feeling for no reason. I pointlessly tapped the status window floating in front of me with my finger (of course it doesn’t actually get tapped) and stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beyond the door went quiet for a moment, then someone said something briefly. I could understand those words without translation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Noel should be arriving soon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The conversation they were having cut off abruptly with those words. They’re probably waiting for this person called Noel. Is he coming into this building?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then footsteps started from the entrance I had come through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was startled. I know I’m safe anyway since I’m in stealth mode, but seeing the person’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Noel was this bastard?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A tall man with green eyes, Agni, walked step by step toward this room. He had an unusually cold expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I trip him or something?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Remembering everything I’d suffered until now, it was hard to suppress the impulse. I at least raised my middle finger toward his profile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni went inside, and the door closed. I turned the translator back on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suspiciously murmuring voices. Agni’s voice, heard sporadically, was low and subdued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The feeling was different from the voice he used when being a smartass to me, which I found a bit unexpected, when the translation result came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  ‘Translation Result’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  You particularly shone in this match, Noel. You performed your assigned role excellently. You really looked cunning, haha.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  The First Call team members really don’t know for sure, right? That I always deliberately act like a villain to draw viewers’ attention and receive additional money in return.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Of course. You’re a flawless scoundrel. But to your mother hospitalized in the hospital, you’d be the best son.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An unexpected fact hit the back of my neck dully. I couldn’t understand it immediately and read the paragraph twice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Agni was coordinating with officials and acting? For money?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right at that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The conversation cut off like a lie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A man’s voice was heard right in front of the door where I was standing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Creak—!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In an instant, I came face to face with an association official.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The most sophisticated stealth technique I’ve ever seen. It hides appearance, sound, smell, and even life energy completely. But what to do. The detection skill I have is one that sees existence, that is, the ‘soul.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cold eyes pierced exactly where I was standing. It seemed like I had unknowingly pressed close to the door while listening, which became the problem. The man looked me over thoroughly with a gaze that seemed to strip me naked after I was caught red-handed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no choice but to release my stealth skill. As soon as the skill was released, the man grabbed my shoulder firmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni, who had been bewildered, checked me and his complexion immediately turned pale. He jumped up from his chair and shouted like a scream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let him go! He has nothing to do with this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why wouldn’t he be involved? He was eavesdropping.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I called him here. It’s my fault!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni grabbed the official and raised his voice. What? Is he covering for me…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Agni was soon kicked out. The official pinned me against the wall and began pouring out English furiously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His tone was very harsh and threatening. It seemed like he might harm me if something went wrong. I, who had been keeping my mouth tightly shut, finally shouted clumsily in English.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Slowly, speak! If you speak fast, I can’t understand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the official looking down at me smirked mockingly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Mocking me? Irritation suddenly rushed over me. My middle finger hidden at my waist twitched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, the sound of the back room door opening wide came from behind me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gaze of the man gripping my shoulder went upward. His eyes became blank as if surprised.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, the hand that had been on my shoulder was forcibly removed. By Woo Sae-geon, who had torn the man’s arm away with terrifying grip strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon was glaring at the official, not me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What the hell is this supposed to be?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t even know Woo Sae-geon was there. Was there a meeting with other people? If I think he happened to come out because of the loud noise during a meeting… the context makes sense while simultaneously not making sense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So, more precisely, Woo Sae-geon’s current behavior.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon asked about the situation in English, then began protesting rapidly in an authoritative tone. During this, he pulled me over and pushed me behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to his consistently calm attitude during our conversations, I had expected Woo Sae-geon would speak English perfectly. But actually hearing the elegant pronunciation flowing from his mouth was surprisingly amazing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A native speaker… so almost native level. Even seeing it directly, it was puzzling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A human who looked like he’d just popped out of an Eastern painting, that is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You go ahead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon threw out a word as if I had no need to stay here and sharply turned his chin. His eyes remained fixed on the official in front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slowly shifted my gaze to the side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t bring myself to say thank you, and saying sorry when I wasn’t sorry, so after hemming and hawing, I finally said quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll owe you one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I returned to the lodging and slept for a while before waking up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after lazing around like that, there was still about an hour and a half left before returning to school. Sprawled on the bed, I thought about what happened earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Woo Sae-geon will handle the trouble I caused smoothly with his eloquence and status.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, I’m in debt to that guy. A shortcut to making hunter life tiresome. My stealth skill was also discovered…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I remembered Agni’s desperate expression as he tried to stop the official. I rolled to my side and buried my cheek in the pillow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It is bothering me… but what’s it to me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni chose to get cursed at by Korean people himself. He’s already doing well with his bad boy image, plus he made money from it. It didn’t seem like anyone forced him either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, wind chime sounds came from outside the door. It was a bell tied to a string that guests shake instead of a doorbell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s me, Agni.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A presence right at the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Goosebumps rose. Sleep completely fled and I bolted upright.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I got permission from the security guard and asked where Gyeon’s room was. Could you show your face for a moment?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, all kinds of thoughts came to me. Could that thing outside be an assassin? He came to eliminate me for hearing something I shouldn’t have.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though his voice was gentle, that guy who was all provocative was acting, so couldn’t he fake this kind of tone too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to turn him away at the door, then changed my mind. I quietly called Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Uhhh…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho answered half-asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Were you sleeping?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Mmmuhhh…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Agni seems to have come for a fight, help me out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Exactly 2 seconds later, a clear voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Fuck. He’s dead.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Sa Ye-ho, with his short hair pressed down according to pillow marks, flew down from the 3rd floor window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing me come out to the yard, Agni approached hesitantly. It was a 180-degree different image from his appearance during the match.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it didn’t seem like he came to fight, Sa Ye-ho decided to listen to the conversation from a little distance while pretending to use his phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you have something to say, say it. Speak slowly. Because if you speak fast, I can’t understand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first word was a bit awkward, but it got better as I spoke. Even if my pronunciation sucks, he’ll probably understand roughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni immediately opened his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “About what happened earlier… Don’t worry. Your team captain handled it well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought he’d question me for eavesdropping on an important secret. But Agni was actually being politely respectful. It was very strange to see the guy who was acting crazy being so docile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he was going to change like this, what the hell was that match about? I suddenly got angry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And also, I came to apologize. For what I did to you during the match. I made you really angry. I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How am I supposed to react to this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I crossed my arms and shot back while looking elsewhere. Agni looked even more flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t need to react. I don’t even deserve your forgiveness. It’s just… you found out earlier. My secret. To me, that seemed like an opportunity to apologize to you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Got it. I heard your position. Is the conversation over?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I nodded and gestured to Sa Ye-ho who was some distance away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, what am I supposed to do here, comfort him? My job was done by listening to Agni’s story and believing him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to turn around, Agni raised his arm and lightly stopped me. And what he said was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Listen. If it hadn’t been for the contract, I wouldn’t have tormented you like that. While I was insulting you, I felt like breaking my own head. Who would want to be so unpleasant to someone they like?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see blood rushing to Agni’s face. He didn’t seem to be joking. There was no lightness in his voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No… but what is he saying? That he likes me…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone likes me? And a man at that?
 </span>
</p>
