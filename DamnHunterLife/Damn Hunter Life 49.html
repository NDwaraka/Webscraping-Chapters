  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 49
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You understood what I want, right? Tell me directly if you comprehended it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person making the call was calm, but Yang Pyo beside him was terrified.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though managers exist to receive successors’ complaints, that doesn’t mean they should act like debt collectors demanding payment like this hyung was doing…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s more, Manager Park Yoon-seok was accepting it all nonchalantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even if I’m wrong, it’s not intentional, so I’ll request corrections. We’ll recruit an authoritative psychiatry professor, and although all doctors have the duty not to leak patient information, given the nature of this matter, we’ll have them sign a strict confidentiality agreement to ensure Yang Pyo successor-nim’s information doesn’t spread, then schedule counseling sessions twice a week. Is that correct?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A professor? Someone that high up? Ah, yes. The more experienced the better. Please put some care into it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only Yang Pyo listening felt strange. Just from the content, it sounded like Gyeon Gang-hyeon was his guardian or something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A person who, even if Yang Pyo didn’t have everything he needed, would take care of it and work to bring necessary things from outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Just from his way of speaking, he sounds like he can solve anything with big talk…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But seeing him insist that such problems should be left to professionals showed he accurately understood his own limits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Also, share every detail of the progress with me. I’ll suspect you the moment you try to gloss over even one thing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Understood.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok, who had been responding readily, changed his tone just once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Instead of doing as you wish, there’s one condition… would you hear it?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon glanced at Yang Pyo, wondering if he had heard Park Yoon-seok’s words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the sound was too low for him to hear. Gyeon Gang-hyeon feigned an indifferent tone, pretending it wasn’t serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What is it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Compared to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s brief tension wondering if this man would finally pressure him—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The content was bland.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’d like to have a leisurely conversation for once. Could you spare some time? If you let me know when you’re available, I’ll adjust to that. Let’s have tea while video calling.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much he pondered, Gyeon Gang-hyeon couldn’t think of anything that could be Park Yoon-seok’s intention. Enough to wonder if he really wanted tea time with a scoundrel like himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After brief consideration, Gyeon Gang-hyeon accepted, and the deal was made.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine. Answer when this number calls. He’s my manager.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having finished his business, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s form smoothly disappeared. It was a return skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo stared blankly at the spot where Gyeon Gang-hyeon had left for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t know what storm had passed since yesterday. His head felt distant. At the same time, reality slowly began to return.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I received help from Gyeon Gang-hyeon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the leader finds out, I’m dead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Woo Sae-geon’s contemptuous gaze came to mind, Yang Pyo felt like hanging himself immediately. Yang Pyo, who had banged his head on the dining table with a thunk, began devising ways to become strangers with Gyeon Gang-hyeon when outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if I pretend not to know, what if Gyeon Gang-hyeon acknowledges me first? I’m screwed…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was just recently that he thought he could give up anything if he could stop Kim Sang-ju, but thinking about the immediate situation kept making him scared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter what, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was still that ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after awakening and quitting alcohol, a troublemaker who could instantly shake up Korea for better or worse the moment he stepped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No, it’s fine. I just won’t run into him! Gyeon Gang-hyeon is a newcomer so our training grounds are separate, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just wringing his hands wouldn’t do anything but make him late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, he’d show himself entering the training ground to get his attendance stamped on the surveillance camera, then courageously enter the training ground…! Confidently!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One second after shouting ‘confidently,’ Yang Pyo became dumbfounded seeing white sobok in his home ground, the earth training facility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Not running into him, what a pipe dream. Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was a master at deflating people, waved his hand fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an annoying greeting after just 20 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you here?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because newcomer training ended.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It ended?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. Won Ha-ri mastered it first and went under Myo Cho-hui. So I’m automatically assigned here now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His explanation was natural, as if he had known this would happen. Yang Pyo finally realized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This hyung approached me with even the day he’d join the other successors in mind.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was certain. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s help must have also included the scheme to secure connections in advance so he wouldn’t be isolated alone in group training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Now I can’t even pretend not to know…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite Yang Pyo’s obvious anguish, Gyeon Gang-hyeon just grinned. Yang Pyo realized he was in Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surely until just now, Yang Pyo had felt great gratitude toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon. He had even felt guilty for being too ungrateful. He had been grateful yet anxious, wondering why Gyeon Gang-hyeon was doing so much for him—that was just moments ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now a different feeling struck him in the face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why do I want to pinch this person’s cheek just once…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of hugging him last night, I should have touched his cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever, forget it. Yang Pyo just gave up. That actually made him feel more comfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why is it just you today?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was so shameless, forgetting the days when he couldn’t even set foot in the training ground and acting like someone who had frequented it since the beginning of time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, that’s because we earth attributes have been training individually all along.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So why? No wait, I think I know why.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon waved his hand to stop Yang Pyo’s answer mid-sentence, then suddenly smiled bitterly as if pitying them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo bristled first at that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not being ostracized!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was just going to say that a certain leader and a certain idol are terribly individualistic?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon would have withdrawn saying he couldn’t concentrate with someone beside him. Woo Sae-geon had no concept of group training. Though he occasionally joined others’ training, it was solely to correct other successors’ skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you hesitating because you don’t want to train?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to do it now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Raise your attribute. What will you do if I’m faster and you’re embarrassed?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m faster!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo became heated and showed himself willingly stepping onto Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, he couldn’t concentrate. Whether it was because Gyeon Gang-hyeon kept entering his field of vision, his stray thoughts naturally flowed toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Awakening really brought a person back like that.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His current appearance was much better than before. People really need to work after all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He remembered Gyeon Gang-hyeon drinking every day, with only liquor bottles seeming to multiply. Watching that hyung bring shame to successors day after day, he had concluded they could never hang out like before again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the past, the successors had suddenly met each other after falling from the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no such thing as ‘recreation to become friends,’ of course. A time when only gloomy sense of mission dwelt due to gates. There was no human exchange between them at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Was that person’s name Woo Sae-geon? He’s really blood-curdling. That kind of person will be our leader from now on? Suffocating…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then, Yang Pyo had cautiously approached Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who seemed the most spirited among the earth attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What he remembered now… was that Gyeon Gang-hyeon had a thin build even back then, before experiencing awakening failure?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And a dining scene from one day came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While eating with Gyeon Gang-hyeon in the cafeteria, two became three midway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m seeing him for the first time in almost 10 years too. I moved away after elementary school.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Gyeon Gang-hyeon had called over Ja Hyeong-woo, claiming they were old friends, and seated him beside them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo looked back and forth between the two with curious eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re successors together with a friend? That’s insane fate. I also ended up here with a friend I went to entrance exam academy with, but he’s a regular hunter.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words about not seeing each other since elementary school were true, they seemed affectionate yet… awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even with Yang Pyo in front of them, Ja Hyeong-woo muttered quietly without a hint of embarrassment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I waited a long time after you transferred.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, sorry about that. Anyway, we met again now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You changed your number.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I had some things going on then. Nothing major.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even sitting beside him, Ja Hyeong-woo hyung would just endlessly gaze at Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face. Without even trying to hide his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So are they completely estranged now…? During Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s wild days?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s consciousness returned to reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That power struggle in the maze gate was no joke. They just didn’t grab each other by the collar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, you look idle? Whew…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, whose appearance had become disheveled from training, leaned his trembling body against him. Yang Pyo, taking it as sarcasm, frowned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung looks like you need to go to a hospital?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Man, right now my training score is better… You’re not like this because of your phobia, huk, you just can’t do it, right? I didn’t know you were this pathetic even in practice…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, infuriated by this, deliberately moved his body away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s thin body, losing its support, crumpled down like a withered plant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His powerless lower body and ankles drooped like a mermaid who had just gained legs, and his upper body was propped up by his arms. In that state, his pale face looked up at Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Yang Pyo’s hesitating eyes, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s lips opened…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You just can’t fight.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wasn’t pitiful at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to take a nap. You can’t do it, so keep training. Good luck~”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo angrily hit the sandbag for about an hour without rest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This pisses me off! Even if I were Ja Hyeong-woo hyung, I wouldn’t reconcile with that person!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was the first opponent Yang Pyo felt stubborn rivalry toward, wanting to beat him. Comparing records with friends and encouraging each other while teasing felt exactly like returning to the old days preparing for physical education.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gradually, the time spent meeting Gyeon Gang-hyeon lengthened, and the sight of Gyeon Gang-hyeon standing at the doorway with a pillow became more than a one-time thing. Yang Pyo somehow forgot a certain emotion that had always pressed down on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What the lonely feeling of having no friends had been like.
 </span>
</p>
