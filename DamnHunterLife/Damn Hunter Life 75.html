  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 75
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Now he had crossed the line.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no room for denial. Ja Hyeong-woo had been looking at Gyeon Gang-hyeon as an object of desire, and had released his urges on his thigh without consent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how angry he was, this shouldn’t have happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the heat passed, a hollow sense of loss remained. The sight of him sleeping with an innocent face that knew nothing added to his sense of doubt. Ja Hyeong-woo hesitantly reached out like someone who had committed a crime and gently stroked Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What just happened can’t be said to be something you brought on yourself. It’s what I did.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The small face was both pitiful and resentful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when feelings of hatred and resentment arose, on the other hand, he was breathlessly just tender toward the other person…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knew that if he would just look at him once, all these complicated feelings would melt away in an instant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after several days passed, Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t see Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While hiding the bandages on his chest with clothes and engaging in training, he kept thinking of Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I never see him again like this… I won’t be able to endure it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He actually knew. Since becoming a successor, hadn’t Gyeon Gang-hyeon disappointed him again and again?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon won’t approach to reconcile first. It would be pointless to expect it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time too, he would disappoint him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is he thinking of me? While Ja Hyeong-woo was mechanically training with water attribute weapons with his mind elsewhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A communication came from Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“A request for successor support came in for the Yeongdeungpo C-rank gate. Despite the low rank, the hunters who went in have had no contact for three hours.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the regular hunters matched with this gate were several A-ranks. Moreover, they were all people with at least one raid experience. It didn’t make sense that they were struggling against C-rank monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a high possibility that the hunters’ feet were tied for some other reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hoping it wasn’t fatal injuries from carelessness or ambush, the most optimistic prediction was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hallucination characteristics are suspected. You and I should go.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A troublesome characteristic. However, since they had experienced a similar gate once in the very early stages of awakening, some preparation was possible now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“However, if you can’t maintain mental composure right now, forget it. I’ll go with Myo Cho-hui.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had been at that scene where Ja Hyeong-woo fought with Gyeon Gang-hyeon a few days ago. He also knew that the two hadn’t even seen each other’s faces, let alone reconciled. (He heard from Sa Ye-ho.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui would be reliable in this field. She’d be unfazed even if the gate showed hallucinations of citizens’ corpses piled like mountains. Wouldn’t she remain composed even facing forgotten memories from the past she wanted to forget? Did she even have such things? He couldn’t imagine Myo Cho-hui falling under hallucinations and losing her mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if someone was injured inside, a healer would definitely need to go in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sending Hae Mi-jun would be concerning due to his timidity. Ja Hyeong-woo soon made his decision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can handle it. I’ll go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Handle my ass, what can you handle!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard Squeaky has also been hiding since then, which is annoying, but hearing that Ja Hyeong-woo and Woo Sae-geon entered the hallucination gate made me feel even more frustrated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw this gate in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So unlike Ja Hyeong-woo’s calm reaction, I also knew how long it took for Ja Hyeong-woo to escape from the hallucination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You can’t come out for almost two days. You can’t even eat during that time. You’re stuck in a corner of the gate where no one can find you.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because hallucinations also interfered with detection skills, they couldn’t use Myo Cho-hui or Sa Ye-ho’s skills either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hallucination described in the original work was a sensory manipulation debuff that showed current or past memories as if they were real.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once you fall into a hallucination, you have no choice but to stay still for days until you shake it off yourself or someone wakes you up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You could shrivel up and die while still lost in memories without even knowing you died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Limited to hallucination gates, it might be fortunate that the hunters are all young, 24 and under.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though there are individual differences, generally the longer you’ve lived, the more potent the hallucinations become.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Older people have experienced more joyful and unpleasant experiences in life, so there are more gaps for hallucinations to exploit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Based on the hallucination gate, I considered how different the current Ja Hyeong-woo might be from the original work’s Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, Busan Gate. He overcame that easily because of me. That’s probably why the current Ja Hyeong-woo’s skills are somewhat inferior to the original. Because he’s less desperate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, the current Ja Hyeong-woo faced and directly jumped into school factional fighting problems that he didn’t know about in the original. An experience not in the original was added.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Setting everything aside, since Gyeon Gang-hyeon is alive and not dead now… does that mean one hardship in life was reduced?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But thinking about the big fight we had recently made it complicated on one hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How many times in life could there have been incidents that would make Ja Hyeong-woo, who never raises his voice, get that enraged?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about it made my spine chill. I think I’m screwed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I haven’t seen his face once since then, and he went to see hallucinations in that state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How can he overcome hallucinations when his heart is full of anger? Like the sleep deprivation incident before, why is this bastard filled with baseless confidence? Or is he just the type who thinks it’s fine if he dies?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Anyway, if Ja Hyeong-woo can’t come out for two days like before, that would be entirely my fault…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throb throb, I can hear the sound of my conscience ringing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let me see if there’s anything I can do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, I become incompetent with high probability whenever gates are involved because of my pathetically inadequate body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, there’s something absolutely advantageous for me in this hallucination gate. That is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even combining all successors, I’ll be affected by hallucinations for the shortest time. I’m certain.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I have no past memories from before realizing my possession.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In human terms, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say I’m a child who has only lived one season.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if forgotten past memories come alive from this incident, it would be beneficial for me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s one more advantage. Since I remember the original content accurately, I roughly know the surrounding environment of where Ja Hyeong-woo might be collapsed in the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Good, let’s go.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Woo Sae-geon might cause trouble later and give me disadvantages, I’ll tell him beforehand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Woo Sae-geon finds out, he’ll definitely use all kinds of personal attacks to prevent me from going, but it’s fine. I have my methods too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Me&gt;Ox Successor: I’m going to support Yeongdeungpo Gate. I definitely said so but the leader’s reply was late. I said so, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By now Woo Sae-geon probably can’t see chats because he’s seeing hallucinations…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Moving to gate occurrence location.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only outside sightseeing Hunter School allows. Of course, you can only move to in front of gate entrances, and when gates close you’re immediately forced to return, so it can’t be used for entertainment other than the purpose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if I hide my face… anyway, association staff will check identity at the gate entrance.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I moved openly in Dog successor hunter attire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In front of the gate where civilian control was being conducted chaotically, one staff member in protective gear was startled to see me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You requested successor support. I’m going in too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But successor Woo Sae-geon said the support would only be him and Ja Hyeong-woo-nim…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to say I’d take responsibility, but since I need to be a scoundrel, I thought it might be okay to speak roughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why, you think I can’t do it? Because I’m weak? Because I get constantly trolled on the internet?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not what I meant…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I haven’t been drinking and my condition is fine. I’m going in because I think there’s something I can help with.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the staff member was at a loss for words and stammering, I slipped into the pure white entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t a violation. I was also properly a successor with two stage records and an adult capable of making my own judgments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My whitened vision gradually returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In case monsters jumped out, I held my bow up high even in a situation where vision wasn’t secured.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Cold.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside the gate was a high mountain area with few trees and full of rocks and cliffs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The temperature was slightly chilly, but if you stayed for a long time under hallucinations, you’d gradually lose body temperature and it would be fatal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because it had hallucination characteristics despite being C-rank. To balance it out, there seemed to be no monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The view is narrow because of rocky hills.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was that I didn’t know where the regular hunters who entered first had scattered, and I couldn’t even see where Woo Sae-geon went.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted loudly while struggling up the hill in front. Every time I adjusted my footing, stone fragments crumbled from under my feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I look down from high up, I might see someone? While thinking that, I suddenly thought of a hypothesis and stopped in the middle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is there any guarantee that what I’m seeing isn’t a hallucination?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stones I could touch, the cold temperature, the dry air all felt real, but that wasn’t proof this wasn’t a hallucination. Hallucination characteristics make you feel all of that as if it’s real.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That was really dangerous just now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I was in a state of confusion, there was a possibility I could slip and fall while climbing the hill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I came back down right away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I set foot on the ground, I saw someone’s figure slip behind a distant rock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t just stand there staring blankly. I followed despite the risk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A large athletic build, dark blue hair tied with a handkerchief. His hwarang clothing fluttered in the dry wind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t call out, but secretly observed his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Ja Hyeong-woo was somehow different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
