  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 119
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had come up on land, sat down with his knees deeply bent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon slipped out from under his shoulder to sit facing him and looked into his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Nothing else is broken? Your ribs?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think… I’m okay.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon answered while occasionally jerking his neck from pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon hastily took out an arrow shaft and fixed Jin Seol-woon’s left arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other Successors were surrounding the boss and engaging in battle. Every time they glanced back, Gyeon Gang-hyeon gave a firm nod with resolute eyes. Meaning that Jin Seol-woon was safe and it wasn’t a fatal injury.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The boss isn’t defeated yet. You might as well stay unconscious.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both their clothes were soaked and clinging to their bodies. Jin Seol-woon, lying on the ground, had his shirt fabric thinly covering his well-trained chest muscles, and his upper body repeatedly absorbed and released the water-soaked fabric as he breathed in and out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s sobok was thicker material than his shirt, but it wasn’t in any better condition. Since it was all-white clothing and only one layer. If he had known his own state, he would have been horrified at how his slender figure was completely revealed. Especially his flat stomach and concave waistline.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hair and delicate eyelashes looked pitiful, dampened with moisture. With that face, he bit his lips and watched over Jin Seol-woon responsibly. Not knowing that his wet clothes were stealing away all his body heat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as the boss was defeated, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes widened as he was rushing toward the two.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hurriedly took off his black durumagi and draped it over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s head like a hood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tore Jin Seol-woon’s sleeve with a knife and checked the fracture site with purple bruising.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Water attribute healers include first aid education in their school curriculum. That was why Ja Hyeong-woo could insert IV fluids by looking at blood vessels, even though he hadn’t had a related profession before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Other work requiring specialized medical equipment like X-rays or CT scans was automatically filled in by healing skills. Healers just needed to apply one of the low, intermediate, or advanced skills depending on the severity of any injury.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tapped Jin Seol-woon’s shoulder to wake him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have to align the bone by pressing it before healing. I’ll do it while you’re conscious—will that be okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a brutal thing to say directly to the patient, but Jin Seol-woon’s expression didn’t change much. He calmly agreed without complaining of pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t qualify to receive Hae Mi-jun-ssi’s skill.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who often provided support to external gates rather than stages, had recently manifested a new skill after training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Tears Shed by Stars (Water Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It could be called partial anesthesia. Hae Mi-jun’s third healing characteristic after stamina recovery and detoxification.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the skill that finally got Hae Mi-jun recognition from people as a healer with independent abilities, not a lower-tier version of Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Hae Mi-jun got this skill, he was so moved that he ran to Gyeon Gang-hyeon. That’s when Gyeon Gang-hyeon said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unlike Ja Hyeong-woo who is almost always calm, you have a kind personality that tears up when seeing people in pain, so that kind of skill was born.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since partial anesthesia was an advanced skill, it had limited uses. Therefore, Hae Mi-jun, following advice from Woo Sae-geon and Ja Hyeong-woo, set strict conditions for patients who could receive the partial anesthesia skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The more serious injuries requiring continuous healing. And the younger the age, the more priority given to using this treatment skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fractures weren’t without pain either, but Jin Seol-woon was insufficient to be a beneficiary of that skill. He acknowledged it himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether idol or whatever, he was a hunter now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Bite down on this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo made Jin Seol-woon bite down on a clean towel. As a measure to prevent dental damage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was also next to him during this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But why does he keep holding my arm?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon looked down at his arm that Jin Seol-woon was gripping tightly as if it were a railing. Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze fell on it too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Gang-hyeon’s arm might get hurt. Hold onto something else.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was a patient. He understood that the process was painful and that he needed something to rely on during treatment. Ja Hyeong-woo barely maintained his reason and spoke calmly.
 </span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not a single magic stone came from the water ghosts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Magic stones were the weakness and heart of monsters, so all living monsters should have them. The absence of magic stones meant that what they had faced were really ghosts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, since this was a phenomenon that only appeared in stages, which were gates within gates, there wasn’t much public unrest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  News articles also focused more on Jin Seol-woon’s arm injury than on the monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The afternoon after clearing the stage, Jin Seol-woon was muttering to himself in a corner of the Successor training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes! I’m fine~”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He smiled brightly at his phone screen and vigorously waved his perfectly healed left arm to show it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He chose the training ground as the place to show his face to fans to emphasize that his injury had healed well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I’ll go train. See you again, GIFT!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “See you next time!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon decisively cut off the broadcast, leaving behind fans who begged him not to go. That cold-hearted aspect was also charming to his fans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, alone again, lightly exhaled through his nose and looked straight ahead. Then he soon noticed a white figure leaning against the wall and flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You must find it bothersome. Having to turn on broadcasts every time something happens to confirm things.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If someone else had said such a thing, he might have been slightly annoyed. Jin Seol-woon just chuckled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If Gang-hyeon-ssi had debuted as an idol, you wouldn’t think that way. This is all the fans’ affection too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon dusted off the floor and got up to approach. He felt good getting closer to Gyeon Gang-hyeon step by step.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Listening to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s voice chattering away was also pleasant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, imagine if it were me. After morning training—I’m fine~. After afternoon training—no problems~. Coming back from a gate—I’m fine~. Just every morning when I wake up—yep yep I’m okay~. I’d have to broadcast just for breathing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed he had been listening to Jin Seol-woon talking to his fans from behind. Seeing how he perfectly imitated Jin Seol-woon’s vocal tone. Jin Seol-woon chuckled inwardly and changed the subject.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you catch a cold? You got wet yesterday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t catch one?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, it would be more surprising if Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body didn’t catch one, but he had reliable backup. Whenever his throat felt a bit scratchy, Squeaky would immediately fix it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the related topic came up, Gyeon Gang-hyeon also had something to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, tell your dragon to stop burying things in the ground. That’s trolling. Why does it do that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm, should I ask?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As they entered the earth attribute training room side by side, Gyeon Gang-hyeon complained. He probably already knew the reason, so it wasn’t a question out of real curiosity. Jin Seol-woon, intending to play along, summoned the Dragon familiar even though he clearly knew familiars had no self-awareness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Gyeon Gang-hyeon pushed him aside and stepped in front of the dragon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You step back. You’re too soft-hearted for this. I need to give it a stern talking-to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon obediently stepped back and received greetings from Yang Pyo, who was slowly approaching. Gyeon Gang-hyeon firmly grabbed the dragon’s whiskers instead of its collar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You bastard, don’t do it. Don’t bury things in the ground.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Up until then, Jin Seol-woon was just letting Gyeon Gang-hyeon be, thinking that person was doing something funny again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing that his heart would drop at Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s next words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you trying to save people? You don’t have to save them. We’re here. You have human comrades!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, how would they understand such words?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had been watching from the side, interjected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It understood.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And eventually, Jin Seol-woon’s dazed voice spread through the space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh, really?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had actually said it, turned around looking even more puzzled. Jin Seol-woon muttered one more thing in a daze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I… understood.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He realized where the Dragon familiar’s habit came from.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was because Jin Seol-woon himself unconsciously tried not to depend on other Successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon, with its high intimacy with its master, had copied his independent tendencies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘We’re here, you have comrades…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon mulled over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words again and again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking that perhaps the Dragon familiar’s habit might be corrected in the future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A change that Gyeon Gang-hyeon had unintentionally brought about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Jin Seol-woon was certain this wasn’t a fluke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon-ssi isn’t someone who follows others, but someone who should lead someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how weak his body, no matter how he tries to hide behind others claiming to be a troublemaker, the power he possesses won’t stay hidden forever.
