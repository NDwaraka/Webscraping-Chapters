  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 150
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is this crazy bastard saying?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You get cocky when I cut you some slack? Don’t feel sorry anymore?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I growled, Ja Hyeong-woo said he was sorry but laughed quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And before my wounded pride could flare up, he kissed me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A tingling heat bloomed from my parted lips. Since I had expected it, I hugged my knees tight and squeezed my eyes shut like someone taking earthquake shelter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve gotten used to this now. I absolutely won’t make a sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, damn it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was pulling my tongue and sucking on it—I couldn’t help it. Ja Hyeong-woo tilted his head at an angle and kissed me again. Saliva naturally flowed in with the deepened kiss. I panted and gulped it down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I unconsciously lifted my eyelids briefly and our eyes met. Ja Hyeong-woo was staring down at me intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My face flushed hot belatedly. Without realizing it, I bit down on my mouth. Even when his tongue got slightly bitten, this crazy bastard let out hot breath as if excited. His tongue filled my mouth so full it was overwhelming. The stimulation rang sharply down my spine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While my vision blurred, Ja Hyeong-woo, who had separated our lips, buried his nose in my nape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Every part of you is sweet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he slowly licked down along my neckline with his tongue. The wet tongue rubbed and licked my skin as it slipped along. A suppressed moan leaked through my teeth at the strange feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uu, uut……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you get excited, your skin’s scent gets stronger…… I can’t think of anything else.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was ticklish to the point of driving me crazy. Watching that bastard murmur and spread saliva on my nape with dazed, drowsy eyes, I couldn’t tell if this was for my sake or for his own pleasure. Is this what healers do?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely managed to move my head and glanced down at Ja Hyeong-woo’s lower area. I wondered why he couldn’t keep his tongue still, and sure enough, his crotch was already bulging.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suddenly realized my chest felt empty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My clothing ties had been undone at some point. When I quickly looked down, those strings were caught in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I discovered my wide-open chest, I pushed Ja Hyeong-woo away. The heat that had been burning my head from half panic and half crisis cooled a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was also a bit troubled. But when he should be begging desperately for forgiveness, that bastard’s gaze traced my skin. He couldn’t take his eyes off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I desperately wanted to raise my hands to cover my bare skin. However, since it would look unseemly for me to cover myself, I endured the shame and glared at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without any excuses or anything else, Ja Hyeong-woo soon retied the knots for me. The treatment ended just like that too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I woke up in the morning, I received a new notification through the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet. My low blood pressure hadn’t returned to normal yet, but they just shove documents at me out of nowhere—what am I supposed to do?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Work-life balance is a mess. How did Woo Sae-geon handle this……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, after checking the title, “Ah, this can’t be helped” came out naturally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the second stage notice I’d received since becoming leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  &lt;Stage 33&gt;
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Appearing Monsters: Earth Ghost (A-rank), Soul Stone (A-rank)
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Personnel Limit: 7 people
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I saw the brief preliminary information, my eyes nearly popped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were too many strange things in these three lines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First of all. Why is the stage number like this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The previous number was 44. Naturally, this time should have been number 45.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But suddenly the numbers decreased backwards—what a mess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, is this a typo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried talking to it, but the status window ignored me again this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I used the system to submit an inquiry with leader authority.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting aside the stage number for now. The next thing that bothers me is A-rank monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the personnel increased to 7 people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not like it’s been that long since it changed to 6 people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If it’s 7 people, that means only two people would be left from the current total personnel.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those two people who were forcibly required to be left behind as the minimum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So we’re already pushed almost to the edge of a cliff?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……No. Let’s not think negatively. I shook my head and focused on objective information instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While spreading out all the successors’ combat power and skills and pondering coordination methods, I had other thoughts too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The stage where we caught the Jangsan Tiger last time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then, Sa Ye-ho was seriously injured at the end. His body was torn by tiger claws and he became covered in blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how stage live broadcasts are basically only viewable by adults, the too shocking and brutal scene went out in full with just a blur effect. Because of the secrecy prohibition rules.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally, quite an uproar arose. The comment section became chaotic with people expressing concern for the successor and mental shock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I had to hold Sa Ye-ho’s hand and even do a press conference.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I went out under the pretext of announcing training revision plans afterward, but essentially made a public apology. Sa Ye-ho defended me, saying he had been inexperienced.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, Sa Ye-ho didn’t suffer from anything like post-traumatic stress disorder. Thanks to feeling pain only very briefly and immediately losing consciousness, then waking up cleanly recovered when the mouse familiar appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, after that incident, I caught him sulking for a while before turning on his personal broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m just a bit scared to turn on the broadcast……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even that shameless kid was afraid of handling viewers’ nagging.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking back on that incident made me sigh deeply again. I rested my chin on the desk and tapped my fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s natural that we could get hurt, isn’t it? So what, are hunters some kind of amazing invincible immortals?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as prosecutors can get hurt while chasing criminals, the hunter profession also involves danger. Even if you initially deny it saying you didn’t become a hunter by choice, eventually you accept it someday. Just like I did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the problem is that the watching citizens find it difficult.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s because we marketed the successors too much like celebrities.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So there was one thing I was considering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If gate conquest reached a stable period and school order was established during Woo Sae-geon’s era, shouldn’t I enable hunters to live like hunters with my own hands?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So what I need to do right now is……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Refuse stage broadcasting.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once I organized it in words, the path ahead only became darker. Would it have been better if it had been Yoon Sae-geon’s era as leader instead of mine?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How much would the association throw a fit? If only I could meet him in person, I would have grabbed Kim Jae-moon’s collar first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, since stage information had appeared, I couldn’t delay any longer. First, I should consult with Sa Ye-ho……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the emergency text sound from my phone and the status window alarm rang simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I checked the alarm content through the nearby status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /A gate occurred in Cheonan City at approximately 10:35 AM today. Automatic matching of regular hunters has been rejected. Switching to manual matching.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know why the commentary is saying this, but anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Such concise words expressed how threatening the gate that occurred in Korea right now is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Basically, when a gate occurs, Korea’s system slots regular hunters from D to A rank into the gate considering their attributes and abilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the matching itself being canceled means that the currently existing regular hunters couldn’t conquer the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, the notification that just appeared means this: S-rank is needed, so bring successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At the Busan Gate, Woo Sae-geon brought successors in only after regular hunters were injured.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Previously, they would have noticed the gate’s condition only after one failed conquest attempt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is a function that shouldn’t exist according to principles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared at the status window for a while, then stopped even that because time was precious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if it was special treatment of unknown intention, it was something I needed right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I set aside consultation about stage broadcasting and everything. This gate is the most important thing right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because it’s directly connected to citizens’ lives.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think we need to mobilize at least four successors. But I can’t pour in all our strength. Since the stage is also right around the corner, I had to conserve the successors’ skills and stamina.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hurriedly pulled out gate analysis files and scribbled various things in my notebook while continuing my thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why do these things always come all at once?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, wait. If it’s going to happen anyway, now is better. Because I can somehow arrange things even if it’s tight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely reconciled my heart that was split in half and began calculating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the first dangerous-grade gate since the leader changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I don’t go in here, it would be a bit much as a leader, wouldn’t it?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is why being a leader is hard. It was better when I was a scoundrel. It was more convenient to take care of my own body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, I also have a clear advantage that other successors don’t have.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……I have many skill uses. As long as I receive steady yang energy supply, I can use them all.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I don’t trust myself either, I needed a safety device. I don’t want to appear on the news carried by regular hunters in a gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I went to find Ja Hyeong-woo at the training ground and demanded outright.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come to a gate with me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’ll immediately say yes, right? He always did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stared at me for a long time without responding, then suddenly smiled broadly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you smiling? Can you laugh in this situation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not a situation where I should laugh, but…… it sounded like you were asking me on a date.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone is about to die from pressure right now, but this bastard isn’t the leader……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How did this bastard become a leader in the original story? Maybe Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t really leader material to begin with?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, I didn’t take this position because I’m leader material either.
 </span>
</p>
