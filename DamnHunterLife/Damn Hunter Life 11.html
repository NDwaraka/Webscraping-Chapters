  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 11
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Um, this skill I just got, it’s a low-grade stamina recovery skill. It won’t be much help in combat, but I’m happy with even this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because he was grateful, Hae Mi-jun was staring at him too intently. Gyeon Gang-hyeon found it a bit burdensome but managed to get through it well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Try using it on me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was starting to feel fatigue creeping in. He’d definitely taken a nap earlier, but what was wrong with this damn body of his?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m drained and sleepy from doing this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So as a light test of his first skill, he casually asked Hae Mi-jun to use it. But upon hearing this, Hae Mi-jun became greatly agitated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t overdo it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He dropped his breathing apparatus with a clatter and acted like he was going to immediately take Gyeon Gang-hyeon and lay him down on a bed. Gang-hyeon flinched at the fuss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll use the skill for you. Anytime. But let’s stop here for today. Hyung, you need to rest.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t want to receive concern from a kid. Feeling embarrassed, Gang-hyeon hurriedly soothed Hae Mi-jun, then added casually with a face that couldn’t hide those feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright. We’ll stop here for today, but starting tomorrow, if you want, I’ll do it diligently every single day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Gang-hyeon’s view, Hae Mi-jun cried a little even then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was about to use his return skill to go back to his house when he looked back at Gang-hyeon again. Hae Mi-jun’s face, which had bloomed brightly without a trace of tears—something that rarely appeared even in the original work—turned toward Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you. Gang-hyeon hyung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s the eighth time you’ve said that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But, you’re not going to tell me the reason this was possible, are you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon gazed quietly into those sparkling eyes that seemed to regard the other person not just as close, but as completely one of his own people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, Squeaky should be cursing from inside his clothes, telling him to stop showing off, but Gang-hyeon didn’t yet have any suspicions about why it was so quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll tell you later.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunter School central area, Building 5.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One of the buildings containing classrooms for regular hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Trapped in a bathroom where [Public] wasn’t functioning, Yoon Cha-on hung his head while becoming Ha Gwon-yeong’s verbal punching bag.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fuck, this is why delinquents are a problem. Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Hae Mi-jun both—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smack, smack. The sound of flesh hitting flesh came from Yoon Cha-on’s cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong wasn’t hitting hard enough to leave marks, but that made it even more infuriating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But… there’s still no way to fight back.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As long as Ha Gwon-yeong’s successor Ja Hyeong-woo and Yoon Cha-on’s successor Hae Mi-jun had the same water attribute, and as long as they were the only two healers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As long as Hae Mi-jun kept being endlessly compared to Ja Hyeong-woo… he himself would inevitably continue to be looked down upon by Ha Gwon-yeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was scary wasn’t Ha Gwon-yeong’s existence. What was truly infuriating was the helplessness regarding his own abilities—that no matter how much harder he trained than Ha Gwon-yeong, he could never achieve comparable results.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the sound of the bathroom door opening occurred. Even so, Yoon Cha-on didn’t lift his head to look in that direction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Whoever it is, if they’re a student, they’ll see Ha Gwon-yeong and get scared and leave.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the person who entered didn’t turn around and leave. The voice sharply calling out in this direction was familiar. It was someone Yoon Cha-on knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No way.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Really? Finally, his heavy head lifted. Yoon Cha-on recognized the other person at the doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A successor one year older than him. He’d always walked around with hunched shoulders so he hadn’t noticed, but now that he looked, the youngest successor had quite sturdy shoulders and a fairly thick neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was glaring at Ha Gwon-yeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Criticizing me is fine. Look down on me and ignore me as you always have.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the first time Yoon Cha-on’s successor had directly stepped forward. Yoon Cha-on felt like he was under some kind of spell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But if that finger-pointing extends to my subordinate, I won’t stay quiet either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successor Hae Mi-jun remembers me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was wearing his hunter uniform. It was a sight he hadn’t seen in quite a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Ja Hyeong-woo was a hwarang, then Hae Mi-jun embodied the image of being his successor, so his hunter uniform was decided to be a nangdo robe mixed with a lot of white. It gave the feeling of a skylark that harmonized with his gentle face, with a feather ornament worn in the hair as the main point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What good is having a hunter uniform if it’s never been used?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would have been gathering dust in his closet. Until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But why did he come out wearing that? Hadn’t he not worn it because he was embarrassed?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Has something come up that requires those clothes now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He imagined Hae Mi-jun being active. Yoon Cha-on’s chest swelled with some kind of expectation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been the Hae Mi-jun successor they’d so thoroughly ignored. But when he actually raised his eyes and confronted them, that stupid Ha Gwon-yeong was crushed by the greater authority and left without being able to make a peep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘See, Ha Gwon-yeong, I don’t know about me, but I told you that if you cursed Successor Hae Mi-jun, you’d get your comeuppance someday.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun approached the spot Ha Gwon-yeong had left. Their eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay? Did that person hit you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Incredibly, this was the first conversation the two had ever shared, yet Hae Mi-jun’s eyes looked upset and held worry directed at Yoon Cha-on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on avoided Hae Mi-jun’s gaze while saying something else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You know my face.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was rare for busy successors to remember regular students unless they were very close associates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t have many people who are mine…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Students aspiring to be healers, one hundred out of one hundred wanted to belong to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The people under Hae Mi-jun were an extreme minority who, despite not being able to belong to Ja Hyeong-woo due to capacity limits, reluctantly accepted positions because they didn’t want to give up being healers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And all of them regretted it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They had no idea that Hae Mi-jun would embarrass them for months on end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry. Because I’m weak.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on looked at Hae Mi-jun without even blinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he knew that the successor before his eyes had the temperament to sincerely apologize even to regular students, experiencing it firsthand felt dreamlike and dazed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve made you wait a lot until now, but could you wait just a little longer? I’ll train so I won’t be embarrassing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Over the past few months, because of Ha Gwon-yeong, Yoon Cha-on had learned how worthless words that come from people’s mouths can be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If there is darkness, there is also light. That’s why Hae Mi-jun’s words carry power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. Successor-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on answered with formal and ceremonial speech, yet unable to hide the wonder contained in his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When it’s just the two of us, you can call me hyung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on watched Hae Mi-jun’s retreating figure until the very end as he left first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was definitely something unfamiliar and surprising, yet somehow the shock wasn’t as great as expected. Moreover, he felt some kind of déjà vu.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gym incident from just last week was still vivid. Somehow Gang-hyeon and Hae Mi-jun overlapped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did everyone eat something wrong? What’s happening?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although it came to mind together, Yoon Cha-on couldn’t deduce the connection between his successor and Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still half in a daze, Yoon Cha-on took out his vibrating cell phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  &lt;Notification Text&gt;
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Preliminary information for STAGE 26 has been sent to the successors.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —The same screen was also appearing on the screens of the successors sitting gathered in the conference room at that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The total number of people in the room was 7.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Currently, only 9 of the Twelve Zodiac had manifested successors. Excluding the 2 who didn’t contribute to combat. In other words, all combat-capable Twelve Zodiac members were currently assembled here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll announce the deployment roster.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ox successor Woo Sae-geon recited in a monotone voice while adjusting the notebook in his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well… there’s nothing really to announce. There’s been almost no change for 5 stages now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He closed and opened his tired eyes to get a better look at the notebook, then seemed to realize the meaninglessness of that action and gave a thin smile with his thin lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “East side dealer, Wood attribute Myo Cho-hui.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of a reply, smooth legs wearing flower shoes under the round table wiggled slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “West side dealer, Fire attribute Ma Cheon-ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yees.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A woman wrapped tightly in black warrior clothing grinned. Her hand stroked the hilt of her greatsword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Center is me. And front, Earth attribute Jin Seol-woon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one called was alone wearing a black shirt among the hanbok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having a conspicuous appearance in various ways, he lifted his sharply cut chin and produced a resonant low voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you know my injury hasn’t fully healed yet?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you know there’s no one to replace you for Earth attribute?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon returned the same words and his black eyes gleamed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon blinked several times with his long-lashed eyes, then lightly touched his injured arm with his opposite hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t have scars if I move around.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Move carefully. You’ll have to accept that much. You need to realize that you’re a hunter now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo rested his chin on his hand at the strangely flowing atmosphere. Not because of the small argument between Woo Sae-geon and Jin Seol-woon, but because of the strategy positions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally, the front position was his place as the only healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he couldn’t understand why Woo Sae-geon suddenly moved Jin Seol-woon, who usually took the rear, to the front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, was he switching places with Jin Seol-woon to go to the rear?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Finally, rear, Fire attribute Sa Ye-ho.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no place for a healer in Woo Sae-geon’s words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo scraped his chair as he shot up.
 </span>
</p>
