  I think this might be influenced by Gang-hyeon having high attribute affinity but low other stats
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because his stats for his own attribute are low, he’s able to absorb other attributes?

  After the Stage video was released, Woo Sae-geon had Sa Ye-ho check the internet public opinion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It went well as hyung intended. Gang-hyeon will probably bang his forehead though. Hyung’s decision to sacrifice Gang-hyeon~”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That bastard brought it on himself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He simply announced the source of the Four Guardian Deities skill straightforwardly. He should be grateful that the physical contact part was omitted…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon seems to have no conscience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he had that thought, a personal communication request came from the ungentlemanly Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Leaderrrrr!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A resounding shout battered his eardrums.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon moved the status window far away. *Cough cough*, Gang-hyeon coughed several times from the aftermath of his own loud voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Living on coughing alone, yet his spirit was alive and well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Why did you say it was my skill! Why! I asked you to say it was Sa Ye-ho’s skill!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Listening to Gang-hyeon’s tantrum, Woo Sae-geon felt his stress relieved for the first time in a while. Suppressing a chuckle, he calmly retorted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You want me to lie to the entire nation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“There’s such a thing as white lies.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Think about your situation. You should welcome people acknowledging you. If you want to retire and receive a pension.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if struck where it hurt, Gang-hyeon was silent for a while, then lowered his voice considerably and whispered pitifully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Just the leader acknowledging me is enough… I don’t need other people…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Click*, Woo Sae-geon mercilessly cut the communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Over there, Gang-hyeon must be holding his head in frustration saying “Ah shit…” That pitiful voice was naturally just an act.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he cut off communication due to Gang-hyeon’s bullshit, he couldn’t say what he originally planned to tell him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That Stage was your last chance.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he should be considering it heavenly luck that the fusion skill possessed such power, he’s making complacent complaints about not wanting attention from people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you couldn’t produce any results even on your final stage, I was going to officially declare the Dog successor a non-combatant and bury him this time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A successor who retires while I’m gone doesn’t have the potential to fill the void of the ‘incompetent Dog successor.’

  After the Gate Break erupted last November, the whole world began slowly adapting to life with Gates. And so, today marks the 9th month since Gate generation began.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The World Hunter Association finally succeeded in connecting the most special and secret otherworld where Korean hunters gather with the global comprehensive system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And with that, finally all hunters on Earth were placed on the same system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  World rankings were registered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Overnight, suddenly, all hunters including successors could see their rankings laid bare.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, regular hunters also called Hunter School students didn’t have their rankings disclosed unless they revealed them personally…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The situation was different for successors whose stats were already public.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The world ranking format is insane.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A Korean man in his 20s named Park Ho-gyeong, facing the massive data ranking site uploaded by the World Hunter Association, followed this behavioral pattern:

  ‘This is so satisfying, ha.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s analysis that Woo Sae-geon’s skills become sharper and stronger as he goes through Stages. Experts said the Woo Sae-geon from the Busan Gate a few months ago and the current Woo Sae-geon are completely different people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even now, that high growth trajectory shows no signs of breaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As much as this was true, it was also an element that made one lament the terrible flaw of Korea Hunter School’s ‘age limit.’ The moment such a person loses all awakening abilities and retires within this year is coming. It could be called a great tragedy that Korea faces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong scrolled down and discovered one more Korean name in the top 30, letting out a cheer.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hyeong-woo hyung, I always believed in you.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since water-type awakeners were mostly healers, they were actually disadvantaged in the world ranking system. Park Ho-gyeong searched the healing group rankings separately in the search function and clearly confirmed that Ja Hyeong-woo was 2nd in the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And returning to the top 30 to look again…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were no more Korean names. At this point, Park Ho-gyeong rapidly cooled down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Let’s just search by Korean nationality.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When searching Korean nationality, only the rankings of 10 people called successors appeared. Whether there was Korean Association coordination, they were listed in zodiac animal order rather than alphabetical or Korean alphabetical order.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, all successors were S-rank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, glancing at the numbers, besides Woo Sae-geon and Ja Hyeong-woo, the other successors also seemed to be positioned roughly within the 100-200 rank range.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Korea is unexpectedly a hunter powerhouse.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, Korea has the dependency that all other hunters use the successors’ power… But still, all successors being S-rank is nothing short of perfect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether the order of animals and abilities really had a correlation, the first two figures were overwhelmingly strong and the rankings gradually decreased toward the back. Park Ho-gyeong checked the successors at the back with a bored expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
