  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 153

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“That’s strange. Emergency communications should transmit voice even if the recipient doesn’t answer.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A clear female voice continued. It was Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My blood instantly ran cold as if my head had been thrown into ice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Something must be wrong, fuck. What if we lose 1st and 2nd place? Gang-puppy! Hey!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Speak quietly. The students can hear too.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Or maybe the communication broke? What should we do?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually, Sa Ye-ho’s voice joined in, running wild in all directions, and my mind, which had been hazy as if I’d taken drugs, snapped awake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh, stop, hng, stop! There’s a communication.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I reached out wildly and luckily grabbed Ja Hyeong-woo’s arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, I was the leader. I’d come to clear a high-level gate, and there weren’t just the two beyond the communication but regular students as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t be pulling down my pants and acting stupid in a place like this!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been focused and sweating a drop or two, finally hesitated. Belatedly grasping the situation, his eyes flashed with murderous intent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’ve caused trouble.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Change your expression before saying something like that. Anyone can see you’re a bastard whose mood is ruined from being interrupted!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But instead of releasing my cock, Ja Hyeong-woo pressed down harder. Then he moved his gaze to the status window as if to answer the communication. While his hands vigorously rubbed both cocks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hng… don’t, ugh, don’t answer! Ahng, use chat…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while speaking, my moans were blatantly obvious. Had I been making sounds like this all along?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo continued his up-and-down movements without stopping, pushing his thing in. My toes kept curling inward. Even though I covered my mouth, moans kept bursting out. I clung to him with my vital point seized, terrified that my sounds would leak into the communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hng, stop, stop your hands! Haugh, I said stop…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, with a truly unwelcoming expression, finally, fortunately, stopped his movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t miss this opportunity and hastily brought up the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Sorry couldn’t hear
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Came pretty far
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stopped mid-chat and looked up at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Say we’ll be back in a few minutes…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My voice was pathetically trembling. In my relief, my eyelids and limbs all went limp. Tears had formed on my eyelashes, making it hard to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment our eyes met through my blurred vision, Ja Hyeong-woo exhaled a dry breath through his mouth. He lifted his clean hand to wipe around my eyes and stroked my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “15 minutes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After sending the chat and closing the status window, silence flowed. I quietly caught my breath while glancing at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought he’d pounce on me again immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did the flow get completely broken in the meantime?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No. His club stuck against my stomach hadn’t softened in the slightest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His own cock was in that state, so why was Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly acting normal?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gentle question suddenly came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You seemed too shocked. If you want to stop, you can tell me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now? I was dumbfounded but didn’t voice it. Because I could see apologetic feelings in Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced at the taut cock tinged evenly pink. The flesh that had reached the threshold of climax before being interrupted looked pitiful, and actually hurt too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’ve come this far, so what are we stopping for?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The corner of Ja Hyeong-woo’s mouth lifted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, with his knees on the ground, suddenly brought his face close to mine. He almost reached my forehead area… then suddenly stopped. Soon he returned to his original position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…He was about to kiss me but came to his senses and stopped.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only when he gripped both cocks together again with his large hands did the smile disappear from him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The clumsy shaking of bodies resumed, the panting and bumping of cocks against each other. Everything in front of my eyes turned pure white and light flashed. Climax was imminent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hng—!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I arched my neck back first and ejaculated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Similarly, Ja Hyeong-woo’s semen poured onto my pelvis. The abundantly scattered fluid dripped down my thighs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I lay sprawled while Ja Hyeong-woo rested his head on my shoulder, savoring the afterglow for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How’s your energy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I was too drained to feel my pulse, I could tell that vibrant energy had seeped into me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether I’d be able to jump into battle shortly after this, I didn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo dampened a towel he carried with lukewarm water and wiped my lower body clean. He tended to me first, leaving himself for later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as the stickiness disappeared, I got up unsteadily and turned my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t look.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Belated embarrassment rushed over me. This time of hurriedly tidying up was unbearably shabby and shameful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I changed into spare white traditional clothes. Ja Hyeong-woo was quick and had already overtaken me. He instantly organized his appearance and even turned over the dirt on the ground to cover all the whitish traces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then finally, he carefully assessed the state of my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It won’t work.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo used his &lt;Puddle on a Rainy Day&gt; skill on me to cover my face. Not knowing what I looked like without a mirror, I reluctantly accepted the skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just regulate your breathing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was calming my panting breath, a thought suddenly occurred to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But if there’s a mask skill, couldn’t we have done it with kissing from the start?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I asked Ja Hyeong-woo, he said, “I didn’t think of it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it was a lie or not… wasn’t worth thinking about. Either way, it would be the same that he wanted to do this kind of thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  &lt;Eyes of Life That Recognize Other Life (Wood Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment when Myo Cho-hui was sitting with her eyes closed, searching for the boss monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, bored from waiting, was idly fiddling with his status window. He didn’t make foolish attempts like trying to become friends with regular students. Someone who wasn’t at school now had told him not to do such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ding. Then a private chat arrived.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Dragon Successor&gt;Me: Is the leader safe in there?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This one’s also chatting me privately for the first time. Sa Ye-ho rolled his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he’s close enough to contact Gang-hyeon directly but doesn’t… something must have happened between them too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about Jin Seol-woon’s behavioral changes, it quickly added up. Then what remained was whether a popular idol who lacked nothing could really set his sights on a fellow hunter, especially another man.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho shook his head distractedly. His thoughts weren’t long. He soon burst into light laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-puppy. Your sins are great.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Gyeon Gang-hyeon was currently accepting someone… that partner would probably be someone other than Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A while later, the boss’s location was identified, but the leader and Ja Hyeong-woo who had gone scouting lost contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Something must be wrong, fuck.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been anxiously pacing around, shot up. Since it was a kid who’d been sick recently, his worry instantly swelled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Sae-geon hyung are different. The current new leader is bound to be worrying. Besides, the one who followed is ultimately a healer, isn’t he?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, who had been tapping the status window, looked back at Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They’re not even answering emergency calls.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll try tracking them with snake skills. Wait.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho called upon his snake familiar’s power and overlaid that energy on his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Snake Eyes (Fire Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s irises changed to those of a bright yellow reptile. His power to detect body heat extended through all terrain and features.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Found them. Right now—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s body shook greatly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He lost his words. Slowly, his eyes returned to normal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s wrong?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, not understanding, asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho gaped for a long time before barely managing to pronounce:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They’re safe. They’re a bit far away. But they’re fight… fighting. Fighting like dogs.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fighting at a time like this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right, at a time like this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s chat arrived after that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had to pay more attention to his poker face than ever before. While facing the returned Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Ja Hyeong-woo and taking down the boss together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the strategy ended, Sa Ye-ho, finally alone, burst out with the emotions he’d been holding back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His face instantly turned red as an apple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Crazy bastards. No, crazy. What the hell?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The silhouettes he’d seen through heat detection were clinging to each other and shaking. Moreover, he’d seen both their lower regions where blood had rushed and their stiffly erect cocks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fuck, whether those two are fucking or doing whatever, fine. But why do it there? Why? How come?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And why me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fuck my eyes! My eyeeees!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He came home and rolled around on his bed. He banged his head on the pillow and lamented. He wanted to scream everywhere. What did I do wrong!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Life is really fucking hell. After going crazy alone until exhausted, Sa Ye-ho looked up at the ceiling haggardly.
 </span>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   What do I do.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Let’s pluck out my eyeballs.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Let’s hit my head and get amnesia.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Let’s die.
  </span>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is there really no choice but to die? Sa Ye-ho gloomily pondered his situation.
 </span>
</p>
<ol start="4">
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Let’s complain.
  </span>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He turned on his phone. After calling until he answered, the other side surrendered on the fourth try.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I told you to call at night.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyuuuuuuuung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he wailed loud enough to burst the speaker, Yoon Sae-geon flinched on the other end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon was retired and wasn’t someone who would spread rumors anywhere. Even if he met Gyeon Gang-hyeon or Ja Hyeong-woo later, there was no worry he couldn’t manage his expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, hyuung. Today I…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He whined and spilled his tragedy. After hearing all of Sa Ye-ho’s words, Yoon Sae-geon let out a quiet chuckle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I thought they might be that kind of relationship.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was too sad. He was as sticky as he was wronged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aren’t I fucking pitiful?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yeah, enough that I’m glad it’s not me.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What, what do I do. I saw something I shouldn’t have seen. My eyeballs rotted. I can’t go back to how things were before. Fuck, I’m fucked. Huhuung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Try drinking alcohol.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho deliberately made sniffling sounds and leaned his shoulders deeply into the large pillow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Comfort me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Tell me when you need someone to hit your head.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not next to me though, hyuuung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had wailed to his heart’s content, suddenly sparkled his eyes like a pet lizard the next moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But what were you doing, hyung?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He rolled around and lay on his stomach with his elbows on the bed. Throughout his chattering, his pale bare feet and legs swayed in the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The call continued for a long time. Until Yoon Sae-geon tried exactly four times to hang up.
