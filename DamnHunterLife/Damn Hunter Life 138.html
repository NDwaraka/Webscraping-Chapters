  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 138

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first priority was to loosen up the team members who were frozen with tension.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon quickly typed a chat. Targeting Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: Hey I’m going to joke around so you play along
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: No matter what happens you and I must not get nervous
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right after sending the chat, Gyeon Gang-hyeon immediately put on a carefree voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s a tiger over there. Let’s entice one of them to become a successor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho picked it up as if he’d been waiting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we scout? Let’s first fight like hell then go with whoever’s left standing at the end.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “To push me this far. You’re an enemy but I acknowledge you. Become my ally! Is that what you’re going for?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But we really became like old-timey people. Climbing a mountain at night! Suddenly a tiger!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’d be good at pansori.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon felt Jin Seol-woon chuckle behind him and Won Ha-ri loosen her grip on his sleeve slightly. He was relieved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I can’t be someone who reassures everyone just by existing like Woo Sae-geon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least I must not show any signs of panic or helplessness in any situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next moment Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes completely changed. He dropped a cold instruction to his same-age friend who had just been joking around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho, secure visibility.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Roger.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho made the flames sparked from his needle tip rise to the sky. The dim mountain path brightened as if lit by fire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A circular area around the successors became bright. The beasts that had been surrounding them from all sides slowly retreated into the darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were countless large tigers that seemed capable of making someone collapse in fear from encountering just one. At some point the low growling had also disappeared and only tense silence flowed. The predators’ eyes were calm, as if aiming to strike vulnerable necks or sides in one blow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Those aren’t just ordinary tigers.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jangsan tigers… Jin Seol-woon let his voice trail off quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, he had wanted to respond to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s joke earlier, but perhaps because of the situation, only serious and unfunny thoughts came to mind so he kept his mouth shut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon raised his eyes sharply as if trying to extract information somehow from the beast silhouettes in the darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knows. The identity of those tigers. That’s why, except for the metal attribute which is advantageous to wood, he only brought people with solid mental fortitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of the Jangsan tigers’ characteristics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyone hearing strange voices or seeing things right now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I only see tigers.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s question, Ja Hyeong-woo answered first, then others responded in turn that nothing was wrong. Chats also arrived one after another.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After confirming with everyone that nothing was wrong, Gyeon Gang-hyeon stepped forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the current state of being surrounded in a circle, they must not rashly break this precarious standoff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Attacks in all directions, all at once. Gyeon Gang-hyeon carefully selected arrows from inventory while being cautious not to provoke the monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If the dragon moves wrong, the entire mountain will collapse… Earth is disadvantageous to move. Fitting for a wood attribute stage.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pure earth attribute wasn’t good. He absolutely had to fuse two attributes to suppress earth to some degree. Gyeon Gang-hyeon selected fire attribute arrows provided by Sa Ye-ho and prepared for other directions as if laying groundwork.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <b>
  Me: Jin Seol-woon
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Sorry but I need to use your dragon just as a dumb shield
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: When I shoot arrows forward, you surround and block the other three sides with your dragon. Just pure tanking today
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Even if the dragon is precious, earth attribute is disadvantageous here so there’s no choice
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Dragon Successor: Yes
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who prepared dragon summoning, also replied to Gyeon Gang-hyeon via personal chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something he hoped third parties wouldn’t hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Dragon Successor&gt;Me: It’s okay, the dragon likes Gang-hyeon
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Dragon Successor: Where do familiars have self-awareness? They just follow their owner’s thoughts
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, startled, glanced back at Gyeon Gang-hyeon inconspicuously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, Gyeon Gang-hyeon seemed too focused on imminent combat to dwell further on what he’d just said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon lifted his bow to eye level, expanded his chest wide and drew the string. Before the tigers in the darkness could even react to the killing intent, he shot the first arrow with almost no aiming motion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Drawing a bright red trajectory, the arrow charged forward fiercely, and thump—! The forest center where the fireball struck shuddered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All monsters leaped up toward the sky at once. Sa Ye-ho’s flames illuminated their wide-open mouths and large, sharp teeth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang! Simultaneously, tigers on the left, right and back were knocked away by the large brown body. The dragon struck them once with its torso and managed to settle down between trees, holding its breath. The dragon familiar sacrificed its own body to create walls behind and beside the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Black fabric fluttered from the shoulders of Gyeon Gang-hyeon as he retreated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That durumagi that Gyeon Gang-hyeon wore so often he now just put it on like it was his own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Can Gyeon Gang-hyeon really replace Woo Sae-geon?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a curiosity that arose in everyone’s minds. The entire nation watching the stage, and even fellow successors, wanted to see that answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The answer was here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud, someone with heavy and imposing footsteps despite their small frame passed by Gyeon Gang-hyeon and came forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The black and white layered skirt worn over pants swayed with vibration. The girl who suddenly stood at the front looked so fragile that even observers felt anxious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only metal attribute, ‘Won’ Successor Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though half a year had passed since awakening, only now was she experiencing her first stage battle. It wasn’t just because she was young.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, with her mouth firmly shut, recalled words Gyeon Gang-hyeon had said one day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re a secret weapon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s childish.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after receiving the young sister’s rebuke, he hadn’t been embarrassed at all. He just stretched his lips and smiled shamelessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s good. Enjoy it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shing, a silver-bearing blade slid out from its sheath. Though the blade looked too thin and delicate to face the numerous tigers still in front, nonetheless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sharp and stinging spirit that could be felt even through the screen emanated from Won Ha-ri’s every movement. Soon it took substance riding on her cold gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sharp metal fragments formed around her and floated up. Every piece trembled finely making resonant sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon wind made of blades rained down carrying the sound of cutting air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Won Ha-ri leaped forward pointing her sword, a scene was captured of a smile spreading across Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s lips through her scattered hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it would be later, the youngest successor’s performance would make all of South Korea enthusiastic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone wanted to know about her training. How she came to have her current skills, whose help was greatest. Everyone competed to wait for the moment she would speak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The person who guided me is the current leader.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that it wasn’t Woo Sae-geon who taught and left drew surprise from reporters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Former leader Woo Sae-geon had tried to train Won Ha-ri, but progress was slow because Won Ha-ri found the stern leader, nine years older, intimidating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, the lack of a senior with the same metal attribute was also one reason. Won Ha-ri had to figure everything out haphazardly by herself, learning through trial and error.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It feels like… breathe more slowly… but your heartbeat should be a little faster.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s what would have happened if Gyeon Gang-hyeon hadn’t appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite her young age, Won Ha-ri coherently included the current leader’s story in her interview content.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Only he could see, understand, and teach my power. All my skills came from the current leader. He has mastered all attributes and theories accurately. The weakness of not being able to physically perform it himself is a minor part.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Before praising me, I hope you’ll recognize Gang-hyeon oppa first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current Won Ha-ri had already surpassed the original work Gyeon Gang-hyeon had seen, except for lacking experience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was serious about others’ training even if not his own, had been assisting Won Ha-ri’s training every evening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Originally I was going to help for when Ja Hyeong-woo became leader… but I’m the leader.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had lamented briefly, focused on the present again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While clearing surrounding monsters with fire attribute arrows, he was also adjusting by shooting the same arrows to Won Ha-ri’s side whenever the storm caused by Won Ha-ri’s blade grew larger or tried to become unstable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He personally demonstrated how advantageous it was for a successor’s energy to be supported by another more experienced successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Countless blades rushed forward as if splitting and re-splitting seconds. Torn tree fragments flew. Swinging rapidly as if crossing swords, curved lines of blades seemed to wrap around bodies from multiple directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s flames collided with the blade, sparking red embers. The sword tip glowed red-hot, shining with a gleaming light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh—! Then one sharp metal fragment grazed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s cheek as it flew by. A bright red line bloomed on his pale skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was careless…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who cared more about Won Ha-ri’s image than his own pain, reflexively started to pour out words then stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because a hand that suddenly extended from behind lightly grasped then released his bleeding cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was always a healer behind him who wouldn’t allow Gyeon Gang-hyeon to get hurt.
 </span>
