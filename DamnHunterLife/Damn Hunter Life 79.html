  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 79
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who was putting on his jeogori again and putting on his outer garment, suddenly focused his eyes and stared intently behind me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is it? I turned around too. I was startled as soon as I saw.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whoa, what a surprise! Why are you standing there like a ghost?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few steps behind, Woo Sae-geon was standing with his arms crossed, giving off an eerie atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How long had he been watching? Didn’t he see from when Ja Hyeong-woo was taking off his clothes? Then it would have looked a bit strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you rescue all the hunters?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you leave it to me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who had walked over, briefly shared the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I found everyone on the missing list and sent them back to the entrance first. What’s left is you two.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt a sharp glare with those last words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the point when Ja Hyeong-woo and I consecutively didn’t answer calls, our two names were definitely added to that missing list.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm! As expected, our leader. Your work handling is perfect.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to dodge Woo Sae-geon’s criticism by being evasive, but the result was a complete failure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon, if you keep acting impulsively like this, when you retire you’ll have to spit out money instead of receiving it. You said to watch your usefulness, but was it to raise my blood pressure? How long do I have to put up with your dog-like behavior?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s blood pressure went up? Great profit… no, I’m frustrated too, you know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You don’t know the original work!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I found this guy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I boldly pointed at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Do you know what a big achievement this is? This person almost died from being left in the gate for two days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wait, how did Woo Sae-geon find this place so quickly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, you’d have to wander around for two days to get out of this place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, I left path markers while coming here.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking now, white sand flowing from the pouch at my waist was piled up softly on the ground two steps ahead. Though I got caught up in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hallucination, my body didn’t move around much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who was just blinking expressionlessly, was perfectly fine as I saw earlier. He deviated from the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I got him out quickly, and… I think I comforted him too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But speaking of ‘path markers,’ one thought suddenly comes to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader, wasn’t it thanks to me that you sent the hunters back quickly? You came here following my path markers, right? Then if you go in the opposite direction of the path, that’s the entrance. Did you use it or not?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon didn’t reply. He just stared at me menacingly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He used it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if the path markers that obviously looked like I made them were annoying to look at, someone like Woo Sae-geon wouldn’t kick away the correct answer right in front of him. Because Woo Sae-geon is a rationalist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine, let’s say you were useful by luck.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My guess was right. The anger faded a little from Woo Sae-geon’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then naturally the target shifts to the side…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, what did you do? A successor lying around just the same? Didn’t I tell you not to come in if you weren’t confident about overcoming hallucinations? Should I now consider that you’ve fallen to a level where you’re completely incapable of self-judgment?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Machine-gun-like criticism stuck into Ja Hyeong-woo’s temple. Ja Hyeong-woo stood there making no excuses with a blank face as if taking no damage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Ah shit.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I must have completely lost it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How can I look at this disgustingly big guy and think of the little kid who couldn’t say a word and just hung his head back then?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After struggling internally, I finally raised my hand to defend Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This guy found me though.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s dead-fish eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stared hard at Woo Sae-geon while ignoring that intense gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You found Ja Hyeong-woo, and Ja Hyeong-woo found you? That’s an achievement?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The excuses seem to get more pathetic…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, what about the boss? Did you find it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since this was inside a gate, it was easy to change the topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even without small fries, if it’s a gate, there’s a boss. The fact that the gate is still maintained means the boss is still alive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I found it. Follow me to clean it up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon turned his back and led the way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Too bad. If Woo Sae-geon hadn’t found it, I could have guided them like in the original work and shown off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I could see the boss monster with my own eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘C-rank gate. Since there are hallucinations, everything else must be difficulty-reduced.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the boss monster was right in front of us, I watched leisurely without even bringing out my familiar. I felt that little sense of crisis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did the World Hunter Association name this thing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sphere.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When you think about it, it’s probably the easiest type among all monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A large spherical mass that just exists, as if prepared obligatorily according to gate rules. Though its exact identity hasn’t been revealed yet, in the original work this was explained to be close to inanimate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No ego, no movement, and naturally no attacks. Therefore, it can be killed very easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Woo Sae-geon could end this monster with just one stab of his sword, I thought of a way to use this opportunity more properly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shall we try that experiment we couldn’t do before?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only Ja Hyeong-woo looked puzzled, not understanding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of giving a lengthy explanation, I just held out my hand to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me one of your things. You have a lot. Something like an attack skill.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an experiment to add another attribute to my attack skill with the special ability I have and see the power. The one that was canceled last time because Woo Sae-geon didn’t allow it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quickly understood my words. He handed over a talisman shimmering with blue light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A healer-type attack skill item. The shape was also suitable for attaching to an arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But how do I attach it?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would seem not to fall off even with just a little adhesive. Since it’ll stick anyway due to the skill effect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After thinking for a moment, I licked one side of the talisman with my tongue. I thoroughly moistened it with saliva and wrapped it around the arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While doing this, Ja Hyeong-woo, who was watching, kept flinching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Was it disgusting?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, the weapon was ready, and there was one procedure left before going in earnestly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After briefly composing my mind, I lowered my gaze and spoke gently inwardly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Squeaky.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I felt genuine remorse toward Ja Hyeong-woo, I thought I had done many things I shouldn’t have to the mouse familiar too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How frustrated must it have been with my suicidal behavior to openly tattle to Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Would my body be okay if I try this? What do you think?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…You were already preparing before asking.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So you’re saying it’s okay?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Yeah, it’s fine. Do what you want to do.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps knowing my change, Squeaky answered gently again instead of ignoring me like before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My mood improved quite a bit. It was more so because of the sensation of cool, soft water attribute intertwining over the familiar earth attribute. I raised my bow and took position. I drew the string long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Grave of the Dead (Earth Attribute)&gt; is activating.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I implement the technique I did with Won Ha-ri’s arrow once more. But this time with more refined energy from my side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt Woo Sae-geon’s gaze observing me closely. On the opposite side, Ja Hyeong-woo watched me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slowly released the string.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk! One arrow stuck in the middle of the sphere monster. The heavy earth tremor that came with the skill caused dust to rise with a rumble!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Probably only I, with my special vision, could see that moment’s scene accurately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment when soft rippling waves gently covered the solid earth energy dwelling in the arrowhead, becoming completely one without damaging each other’s energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Amid unknown excitement coursing through my body, the skill’s power gradually subsided. Soon the sphere monster’s appearance became clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even that pathetic sphere monster didn’t die from my intermediate attack skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, the arrow’s lethality had become extremely weak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They say if earth is too big, it blocks water. Did you mess up combining attributes, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, or is your fusion ability completely worthless to research?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can only see water so I don’t know well, but the attack doesn’t seem to have worked properly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Woo Sae-geon’s rebuke and Ja Hyeong-woo’s addition, silence flowed. Both looked at me suspiciously, waiting for what I’d say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What do these humans take me for?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If these humans could have seen the scene I saw, they couldn’t have such suspicions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By my standards, it definitely succeeded. The damage being worse than expected is a separate issue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to research more, but for now my hypothesis is this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “From what I saw, it’s an attribute difference.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threw the words first and glared at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Where do you put weak water into a sacred attack skill? This is water’s problem. I’ll never use your attribute again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I want to really annoy this guy who’s been careless because I’ve been treating him a bit loosely until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyebrows shot up. He’s offended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I’m satisfied. Before Ja Hyeong-woo could retort, I quickly shot another arrow to finish the boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few days later, I encountered Ja Hyeong-woo on the opposite side of the training hall corridor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since both he and I were just passing by, we could just keep passing. But when I stepped aside to the right first, Ja Hyeong-woo also stepped that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I moved left again, he followed and blocked my path.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually I stopped walking as the distance became too close while being blocked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
