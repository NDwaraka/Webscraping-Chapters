  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 176
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, there was a separate reason Park Ho-gyeong was at school despite it being vacation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because his father had appeared on a broadcast a few weeks ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“There were really many people curious about what kind of person the 2nd generation successor leader Gang-hyeon was.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His father, who he thought was just part of the Hunter Association’s administrative team, turned out to be personally assisting the person Park Ho-gyeong found most disagreeable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Dad was Gang-hyeon’s manager? Why didn’t you tell me! Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His twin sister Park Ho-jeong’s booming voice made his ears feel like they would burst.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Dad took care of our Gang-hyeon and even made him awaken! Amazing, well done!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She’s excited. Watching Park Ho-jeong cheerfully squealing with renewed energy, Park Ho-gyeong felt uncomfortable and turned his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then his eyes met with his father’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you surprised? This is my job. I’m proud of myself for looking after Gang-hyeon-nim. I hope you can also do work that satisfies you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His father knew that he had been cursing Gang-hyeon loudly like a joke with his friends. Yet he smiled at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll go get some fresh air.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From that day on, he wasn’t at home and often went out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong was upset that his father was completely devoted to the successor he had mocked and criticized so much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when they said the delinquent had changed and become a leader, he had just sneered, saying the past wouldn’t disappear anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, the past doesn’t disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……The years Gang-hyeon spent fooling around don’t disappear, but the longer years he struggled and fought illness also don’t disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong looked at Gang-hyeon leading him out of the collapsed department building and handing him over to rescue workers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He must have seen father’s face for a long time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong looked a lot like his father. But Gang-hyeon didn’t recognize him. He quickly carried him up like lightning and hurried away without exchanging a single word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While his guilt lightened somewhat, he simultaneously felt strange. Park Ho-gyeong’s heart squirmed and swayed strangely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What should he do if he was uncomfortable with his father bowing his head to someone his own age?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The answer. I should also serve and revere him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Our family can just become a full-fledged secretary household. From now on, I’ll call him hyung-nim. Anyone who curses Gang-hyeon in front of me can die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong decided to become a new person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The empty road at night sparkled with the bike’s illumination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon was straddling a newly acquired bike instead of the broken one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With small lights on and wearing a helmet, the bike turned its wheels with small noise and raced down the road.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dim scenery with occasional streetlights quickly passed through his vision. Within that, Yoon Sae-geon saw something strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small person was standing in the grass.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when he blinked, nothing was there. Was it an illusion? Yoon Sae-geon turned the corner and raced down the expanded lanes. The cold wind gave a refreshing sensation without penetrating his thick clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the same figure flashed by from grass in another direction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small force entered his temples inside the helmet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t believe in ghosts. So he dismissed spirit monsters as merely simple monsters. He trusted only his own intuition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why he had to stop. The air surrounding him was ominous. His instincts warned him to turn back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he thought he should change direction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small-figured person appeared right in front. It was in the middle of the road.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon turned the handle to the maximum. Screech— the wheels left rough marks on the road. With athletic abilities far from ordinary people, he barely swerved away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only the boy hadn’t thrown himself in front of the bike.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bike crumpled like clay. It was damaged and even corroded to the extent that if the bike had life, it would all have been taken away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That force even collided with the driver’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon, who crashed onto the road, didn’t move. The small figure shuffled its feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong crouched in front of him. He pulled off the helmet and threw it on the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gripping the other’s neck like a handle, he dragged him away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The lights in the successor training ground finally went out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why do you guys volunteer for overtime? Are you suckers?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Unlike the Leader, we have energy to spare, so what?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m dying of sleepiness…… I’ll let it slide today but adjust the training amount from tomorrow. Damn bastards.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They came out of the training ground in a group. They walked down the dark corridor making trivial conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the lights in an empty conference room suddenly turned on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Light from the door crack stretched long into the dark corridor. Yang Pyo got scared first and grabbed my arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With a strange feeling, I slowly moved in that direction. Then Ja Hyeong-woo went in ahead of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was nothing strange inside the conference room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the screen was different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You’re late. I almost killed this person waiting.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a familiar face beyond the screen. Beom I-ryeong, sitting with crossed legs in a dead-end room, smiled at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dialogue was the same as last time. The difference was that Beom I-ryeong was outside and I was trapped inside the school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it was a space I’d never seen before, I was certain that place was outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After seeing the person lying face down at Beom I-ryeong’s feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While everyone froze and couldn’t say anything, Sa Ye-ho pressed close to the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s pupils gradually dilated. I urgently reached out to Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho let out a death-like scream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His eyes became bloodshot and he thrashed wildly. He tried to rush at Beom I-ryeong, who he couldn’t possibly reach, and destroy the screen. I hugged Sa Ye-ho tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I soon got hit and bounced away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, solid arms supported me so I wouldn’t fall. Ja Hyeong-woo gently set me down and immediately strode over to grasp both of Sa Ye-ho’s arms. It was strength of a completely different class from just before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But where did such strength come from? Even when Ja Hyeong-woo expanded all his muscles, it wasn’t enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing Ja Hyeong-woo who seemed to be seriously considering knocking him unconscious by hitting him, I presented a more certain method.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had been standing dazed, was startled by my call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo had a knockout skill. He took away consciousness with the skill that had the fewest aftereffects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Sa Ye-ho become quiet. Ja Hyeong-woo handed Sa Ye-ho’s body to Yang Pyo like a piece of luggage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I regulated my breathing evenly and glared at Beom I-ryeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That person isn’t a successor, he’s a civilian. Do you even know?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Calm but not refined.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This fucking shameless bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The detestable face that still maintained a boy’s appearance recited words as if bored.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“That’s right. Let’s talk again after cleaning up the corpse.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t! Stop!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the large metal rod Beom I-ryeong held drove down hard into Yoon Sae-geon’s lower back, precisely where his spine was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a chilling sound of bones breaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly checked from behind. I saw Ma Cheon-ah covering Won Ha-ri’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s expression was distorted but he had strong mentality so he’d be fine. Myo Cho-hui was obviously fine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun and Yang Pyo couldn’t block it because they didn’t have the capacity, but they were holding up without collapsing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared at the screen again. I hoped luck would follow. I prayed for Yoon Sae-geon to breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon was conscious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I confirmed his intermittent twitching movements with clenched fists, breathing became difficult to control.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to ask what he wanted, Beom I-ryeong first narrowed his eyes toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Come here.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The same words without fail.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this time, it sounded like he literally meant to come to that place where he was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If a gate didn’t open, there’s no way I could go there. That’s Korea, and I’m at Hunter School.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought it might work with the dispatch function since Beom I-ryeong was a monster, but that function didn’t work either. The cause isn’t exact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps…… it’s because Beom I-ryeong messed with the system while disguising as a successor. Plus he would have damaged the system more by secretly leaving school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While thinking such thoughts, a certain idea suddenly flashed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If there was a crack in the previously perfect system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You want me to come there?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes. Come here.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I readily agreed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong wasn’t very surprised. Only the kids around me seemed shocked. Especially Ja Hyeong-woo gripped my arm tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Getting scared first without even knowing how I’m supposed to get out.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I chose. To follow Beom I-ryeong’s demand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because an important person’s life was at stake, I brought out the secret I had been saving and took a step into danger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Boundary Between Life and Death (No Attribute)&gt; is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The half-complete skill that first appeared when I had just awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now I know. This skill is also complete.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because the rules of this school are me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Using the energy I felt while fixing the system as a guide, I groped to find the crack in the system. And I placed my skill there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I am an entity whose abilities, substance, and myself as a person are all unclear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crack—! Something like a flat wall I didn’t even know existed shattered away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he didn’t expect it to come so suddenly, Beom I-ryeong’s eyes widened as he looked down at the floor. On that floor, my foot that popped out from thin air was placed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if I had crossed dimensions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m here. What now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a warehouse like an abandoned building. He must have watched some noir movie. I let out a small laugh with slight mockery.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But who said only I would come?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t just use a trick to cross the boundary alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I broke the prohibition of Hunter School. Making myself into the system, I constructed new rules.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors also followed me across. S-rank hunters accumulated one by one in the abandoned warehouse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong’s expression gradually crumbled. I sneered and ordered toward the back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wake up Sa Ye-ho.”
