 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The handwritten text was persuading the Association in an extremely calm tone about why Gyeon Gang-hyeon should succeed him, and why he had personally chosen Gyeon Gang-hyeon.

   Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon is familiar with all successors’ skills and excels at utilizing skills appropriately according to combat situations.

   Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon possesses fusion skills and has skills comparable to the advanced skills of former Korea #1 Successor Woo Sae-geon. While there are concerns about insufficient physical abilities, this can be supplemented through characteristics.

 <li>
  <b>
   Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon is the only one capable of emotional exchange with all successors.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon put down his pen and briefly recalled the faces of others. The young successors who all froze up just from seeing his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In contrast, Gyeon Gang-hyeon got along comfortably with the young successors and put them at ease, brought Jin Seol-woon into training. He gained Myo Cho-hui’s acceptance and Sa Ye-ho liked him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crucially, he could handle the next Korea #1, the most outstanding healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When it was time to catch mice, that’s finished. Now that it’s stabilized, it’s time to hand it over to a new flow.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Woo Sae-geon didn’t know. That now wasn’t a stable period, and the current peace was merely the calm before the storm of what would come later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, even if he had known, in his situation of having to leave, he would have chosen Gyeon Gang-hyeon again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hehe.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On Woo Sae-geon’s last day, Sa Ye-ho finally succeeded in forcing his way into his house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s house maintained the original hanok structure intact. Perfect for supporting the scholar image he had been portraying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as he entered his private space, Sa Ye-ho looked around eagerly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s persistent gaze, which had been that of someone indulging, stopped abruptly upon discovering Woo Sae-geon sitting in a chair with his legs crossed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On his exposed bare shoulder blade were bird wings, and on the trapezius muscle leading to his neck were a few sprigs of unnamed wildflowers. With his hair loosely disheveled, holding a drawing pencil and legs crossed, Woo Sae-geon wasn’t hiding himself, wearing only a white undergarment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho became curious about who had tattooed those designs. But he didn’t ask.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Are you drawing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a line he couldn’t cross, a curiosity he shouldn’t have about Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To be allowed by his side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On his last day as a successor, finally putting down training, he spent time drawing on canvas on an easel. A black and white drawing with intricate patterns was carved on the white paper. It was a tattoo design.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho played beside him as always.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Today marks the end, and Sae-geon hyung returns to being an ordinary boy again…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Playing magical boy games too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, listen. Hyung, so I said really loudly, ‘Why the hell would I say such bullshit?’ But it’s not like it’s the first or second time I’ve raised my voice on broadcasts. GO Ye-ho the human siren, right? So—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Chattering away with one-sided conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if bothering Woo Sae-geon was his job, he fully displayed his natural talent for being charming beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, receiving Woo Sae-geon’s look that said ‘pack up and get out,’ he answered “Okay” as he always did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he acted as usual, Sa Ye-ho actually knew well that he wouldn’t be at the school anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He got up and showed his back to Woo Sae-geon as he left, then looked back slightly as if he had forgotten something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, happy 24th birthday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Returning home, Sa Ye-ho fidgeted for a long time with the high-proof bottles in his wine display.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He picked one up, put it back down, went to the bathroom and came back to take it out again, then just left it, repeating this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally deciding, he grasped a bottle and burned open the cork. He trudged over and settled on the sofa. He brought the opening to his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Through his half-closed eyelids, Sa Ye-ho saw his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Sa Ye-ho bolted upright and poured all the alcohol into the sink. His face was severely distorted as he threw the bottle with a clang.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [‘Teleporting to ‘Ox’ Successor.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his head burning white, he couldn’t even see the other letters clearly as he brought up the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Invalid command. Cancelled.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, fuck…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho turned and ran out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He tore the annoyingly obstructive hanbok skirt that he wanted to kill and immediately kicked the door. Fabric fluttered wildly behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While running across the courtyard, past scenes unfolded in Sa Ye-ho’s mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That special moment of that day, not faded at all, remaining intact like a photograph.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Successor? What’s that? Fucking interesting. Like a game.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because he lived playing games so much, even when others were shocked by gates and such, he adapted quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While wandering around the chaotic school looking for other humans called successors, his body was suddenly yanked behind a corner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hard, strong grip that covered his wide-eyed mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Black hair poured over Sa Ye-ho’s face as he looked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t make a fuss. You must be one of those successor things too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A fully exposed forehead and straight black hair. Thick, masculine neckline, and tattoos slightly visible outside a black turtleneck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “From now on, follow my instructions. Answer what I ask and bring what I tell you to bring.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked up at the face with dark features that would make him look like a complete kid standing next to him, then nodded without a word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having lived in America all along, he spoke Korean well but didn’t know much about how Korea worked. Sa Ye-ho filled in his empty parts from beside him. And followed him around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon probably didn’t know the guy he grabbed in passing would be such a chatterbox.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To others’ eyes, they probably looked quite close.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …But all of this was a relationship that would end when being successors ended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon someone’s back came into Sa Ye-ho’s view.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wearing only the clothes he had when he first came to school, quietly heading toward the entrance, refusing anyone’s send-off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s a line that absolutely shouldn’t be crossed. The moment it’s perceived as genuine, he’ll stiffen and avoid me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Feeling a rare heaviness in his life, Sa Ye-ho pulled a shout from his throat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the scene of him turning around, Sa Ye-ho felt fear for the first time in his life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And even greater thirst.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you have to go to America?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence came to the empty space. The sound of Sa Ye-ho gasping for breath echoed in the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s seemingly emotionless gaze cut through the space between them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hands and feet were all trembling. Gyeon Gang-hyeon was in a state of seclusion due to unprecedented anxiety symptoms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Woo Sae-geon had declared he would pass the leader position to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No. It’s not fucked yet. There’s the successor vote! Ma Cheon-ah and kids like that will oppose it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, clinging to one strand of hope, bolted upright.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After some time passed, a notice arrived with the signature results of all successors. Gyeon Gang-hyeon opened it with more tension than college entrance exam scores.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And despair overwhelmed him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

  ‘Why… why?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he had lived as a scorned delinquent until now, he had never felt such alienation. Gyeon Gang-hyeon was so shocked he trembled as if about to faint.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But to go question the others…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho would fan the flames saying ‘Giggle congratulations!’, or Hae Mi-jun would say ‘I also voted for Gang-hyeon hyung!’ with such a blissful sunny expression that he couldn’t curse at a smiling face, or he’d get furious seeing Ma Cheon-ah ruining the school with her reckless vote saying ‘Well, the dog seemed most manageable.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a situation full of landmines, Gyeon Gang-hyeon realized there was only one person from whom he could hear a properly serious answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He forcibly used teleportation on Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A face suddenly encountered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Water dripped from Ja Hyeong-woo’s drooping hair as he blinked his wide eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Precisely because of such emergencies, mutual prior agreement for teleportation between successors is usually strongly recommended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Gyeon Gang-hyeon had been just one minute earlier, Ja Hyeong-woo would have been completely naked from head to toe. By a hair’s breadth, he had just finished showering and wrapped a towel around his waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should have not worn the towel. …No, it’s good he did.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had hoped to see his entire naked body and make him flustered, but thinking again, it was better this way. He would have been caught getting aroused.
