  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 151
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Don’t know. At least I got a healer.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Assuming I’d be the tanker myself… then it was time to find a dealer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought of Sa Ye-ho, but since I didn’t know where he was, I used the communication system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Eww, I don’t want to. I’ve been seeing too much monster blood lately. Sae-geon hyung isn’t around either.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this damn bastard had another bout of his lazy disease. Just as I was suppressing my bubbling anger and wondering how to curse him out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Who’s going?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Mm, got it. How generous of you! I’ll go.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What the hell. I didn’t do anything and he changed his tune on his own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, both Sa Ye-ho and I are poorly balanced, so it seemed like we’d need to bring one more person. Just in case.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If it’s a regular gate, we can get reinforcements later… but that would be embarrassing to watch.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, we had to go in once, crush everything decisively, and come out. I’m serious about this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I just bring Yang Pyo to steamroll everything? No wait, Yang Pyo needs to save his skills. And that bastard gets mentally weak if he uses them consecutively.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon too… doesn’t have abundant skills. And his dragon familiar was particularly overworked in the last stage. It would be better for him to rest for now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I thought that, an uncomfortable feeling welled up in a corner of my heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I leaned my head back against the backrest and thought about whether the judgment I’d just made was truly objective.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It doesn’t seem like a judgment I made while deceiving myself because I wanted to avoid Jin Seol-woon. I looked at it as a leader.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then among the remaining successors, someone worth bringing would be…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I brought up the private chat and briefly pondered what to say. I must always stay alert and be careful with every word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>

<p>

  Me&gt;Rabbit Successor: I’ll request support for Cheonan Gate.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Rabbit Successor: Me, Ja Hyeong-woo, and Sa Ye-ho will go.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whew, she listens well. I secretly breathed a sigh of relief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I became leader, what I feared most was precisely Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Could Myo Cho-hui really tolerate having me, not even Yoon Sae-geon, above her?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So to win Myo Cho-hui’s favor, as soon as I became leader, I started tinkering with the system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The function I messed with was the status window video call feature that could connect to family members’ and acquaintances’ phones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pestered the system to upgrade this video call function. I improved the video quality to high definition and extended the duration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it was a privilege given to all hunters, Myo Cho-hui was someone who would give back proportionally when she received what she needed. You could say her calculations were precise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I did wonder why Woo Sae-geon never did things like this when the system made it possible…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe this too was a kind of preferential treatment the system showed only to me…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After sending word that we’d depart for the gate in 10 minutes, I stared intently at the status window. Again, my lips moved involuntarily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you want something from me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no expectation of an answer, but.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the status window blinked and displayed text.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /Please hurry with gate support.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit, I’m going, I’m going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thus began a dangerous journey with me and Ja Hyeong-woo at the front (I didn’t want to be side by side with this bastard like a pair), and Sa Ye-ho and Myo Cho-hui behind us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an outing after a long time. Ten regular hunters were gathered at the gate entrance. They were skilled students I’d manually selected from the list I got by having the system do rematching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s Gyeon Gang-hyeon-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whoa, he’s coming in person…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since my senses had become uselessly sharp after awakening, I could hear all the students’ whispered conversations. As an awakened one, my five senses were somewhat better than ordinary people’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho asked, “Should I speak for you?” but I shook my head slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I stepped forward, the students instantly fell silent. The hem of my black durumagi fluttered in the cool breeze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who’s your leader right now? Come out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A big guy emerged from among the regular hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regular hunters also had to form teams when entering gates, so during hunter education classes, there were people who chose and learned the ‘leader’ position. If I was the supreme commander, they’d be like deputy commanders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m under Ma Cheon-ah-nim of the fire attribute. My name is…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After hearing just his name, I waved my hand to indicate he didn’t need to explain further. Instead, I spoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re left-handed. You usually hold your sword with just that hand. The kids are usually accustomed to right-handed movement patterns, so be careful of collisions. And your right ankle—it seems like you overdid it during training, so don’t let your energy leak toward that side. Well, I guess you’d know better than me even if I didn’t explain all day…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I rambled about what I could see, I suddenly looked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the regular students were staring at me with sparkling eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why… why.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How did you know all that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The student in front of me asked loudly, as if amazed. I felt a bit awkward and tilted my chin diagonally. In my embarrassment, a sharp tone slipped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can see it through the flow of qi. Don’t you know that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking with my eyes, I could tell how this student had been training their fire attribute until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The red energy more concentrated in the left arm than the right. Moreover, by looking at how the energy bounced, I could gauge what weapon they used.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could naturally also tell what trajectory and patterns they used to swing and defend with their sword. Following the grain of the flowing flames, a hazy image would emerge as if this student was actually demonstrating the swings in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t like I was some master from a martial arts novel, and I still felt uncomfortable with this version of myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow… that gave me chills just now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve heard about seeing through everything, having X-ray vision and such, but this is the first time I’ve seen it directly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Listening to the students exclaiming one by one, a strange feeling crept up along my skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I still remember it vividly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the first day I realized I’d possessed someone’s body, the praise from students pouring toward Ja Hyeong-woo as he passed by me in the cafeteria.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then, I was quietly eating my rice while listening to the harsh gossip stabbing into my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words referring to me then were consistent. Scoundrel, trash, incompetent. Even the exhausted Ja Hyeong-woo had said to me:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The current you would die instantly just from being grazed by a monster’s claw. Keep living pathetically like that. Reeking of alcohol.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The students look up to me. The admiration they had for Ja Hyeong-woo is now directed at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And despite having his praise stolen away, Ja Hyeong-woo himself…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo is staring at me with his mouth agape like an idiot. As if he’s the one hearing the compliments meant for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when our eyes meet, far from being embarrassed, he smiles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Don’t look at me smiling in front of others!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah shit, whatever. I’ll curse Ja Hyeong-woo out thoroughly tonight—. While I was at it, I went on talking, mentioning each of the other students one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The tall wood attribute kid over there should pair temporarily with this one. I think your combat styles will match well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow my insides were stirring. It wasn’t a bad feeling. Various emotions were tangled together, but still, one thing among my current feelings I could clearly explain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The feeling that I don’t want to disappoint anyone anymore.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time since becoming leader, I was proud to be a leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The students behind me were expecting my performance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, among them, there were probably people mixed in who had opposed me becoming leader. According to the numbers written then, probably with a 60% probability.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So I need to show them a proper performance.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My dog familiar sprang out from me. Immediately taking up my bow, I launched a preemptive attack against the monster horde.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Lonely Gravedigger (Earth Attribute)&gt; is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the surrounding mobs were cleared, I changed tactics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Myo Cho-hui Successor, please scout for the boss. Sa Ye-ho, you guard her. And command the students too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okie. But what about you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to scout the perimeter and scrape up some magic stones.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having personally witnessed the power of my tanker skill and dog familiar, the students didn’t particularly object to me splitting off alone. Only Sa Ye-ho looked at me with suspicious eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo naturally followed behind me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I continued advancing through the forest. Until I was far enough away from the students.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When we entered a dim cave, Ja Hyeong-woo finally seemed puzzled and grabbed my shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ignored him and pressed my hand against the wall. Only then could I squeeze my eyes shut. I’d been having dizzy spells that made my vision sway since earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah shit…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I really overdid it!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m from a delinquent background, so I thought feelings like wanting to show off in front of kids had long since disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Belated panting breath leaked out. After calling my doggy and using skills, my body was worn out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, sensing something was seriously wrong, lowered his voice and tried to turn my body around. I glared at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Didn’t you put in enough yang energy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah… sorry. Really—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Idiot, the gate itself was an unexpected situation. Can’t you even make that much of an excuse?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was briefly confused and couldn’t grasp the context.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sighed deeply, as if the ground would cave in. Soon I looked up at the damn bastard and gave clear orders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Heal me now.”
 </span>
</p>
