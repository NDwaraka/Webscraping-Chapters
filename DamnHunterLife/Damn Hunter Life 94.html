 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, Myo Cho-hui, who had been freed from her boss-searching role, raised her large glaive high while on her rabbit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, from atop her familiar, the tip of her glaive couldn’t reach the pile of bugs below.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, unlike me or Sa Ye-ho, she didn’t use consumable weapons, so she couldn’t throw her spear either. Even if she threw her spear to stab the bugs with a thunk!, there would be no way to retrieve her weapon again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, gauging the distance, tried to grow vines to pierce through or strangle the bugs. However, the snake-like bugs were small and flexible, easily slipping through the vines with swift movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, I saw green energy blooming in dots from Myo Cho-hui’s petite body in a way I’d never seen before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like dozens of tiny Tinker Bells.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Rebuilder of Barren Land (Wood Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An attack skill that Myo Cho-hui possessed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sprouts wildly sprouted from the bodies of the bugs that had been unable to cling to the familiar and were running wild.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hissss! The bugs writhed in agony before falling down with thuds. In an instant, corpses piled up below.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This happened with just one glance from Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rebuilder of Barren Land. Originally, it was just an ordinary skill that dealt small damage over a wide area and to about one large monster…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it worked devastatingly well against the monsters before our eyes, enough to be called their natural enemy. Woo Sae-geon’s intentions hit the mark perfectly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Sa Ye-ho stepped back to find the boss’s location, and Woo Sae-geon painstakingly carved out bugs one by one with delicate sword strikes that consumed quite a bit of stamina—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boar familiar staying in the center stood still and acted like a turret. Blue light would appear and light beams would fly to allies, or arrows would shoot out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo reduced the damage the familiars took with heals while occasionally using debuff skills. Hae Mi-jun looked after my health while supporting his teammates’ attacks with stamina recovery skills. He also removed the poison scattered by the four-headed bugs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I want to attach bombs to arrows and shoot them.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I shot and killed one bug, there were still hundreds more swarming together. Getting competitive, I applied a skill to my arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Grave of the Dead (Earth Attribute)&gt; skill is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk thunk thunk! The arrow pierced through several bug bodies at once and toppled the bug tower.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now this felt worth shooting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If my body’s too weak to shoot hard, my head has to work harder. Such is my fate.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, a chat appeared on my status window. Now quite familiar with it, I checked the chat without stopping my shooting.
 </span>

  I made all sorts of expressions. To the people watching the stage, I kept my face fixed toward the bugs as if it was because the bugs were disgusting.

  Actually, Ja Hyeong-woo was right behind me. Since we were both riding the boar familiar.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When is he going to stop thinking of me as a friend?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bugs that seemed like they would swarm endlessly finally began to decrease gradually. Fortunately, if you could call it that, no boss had appeared until then.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  3 hours and 38 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone seemed unaware because time had flown by while killing mobs, but I was acutely aware of it. My arms were shaking and my eyes were closing from shooting arrows for 3 whole hours.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time spent killing small fry had gotten too long. Since the stage grade was A, it was living up to its reputation. We were being thoroughly pushed around by an A-grade stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Woo Sae-geon proceeded with the next step without wavering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho, the boss.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Found it~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While luring out the boss buried underground, he didn’t forget to lecture.

  The ground rumbled loudly. That four-headed bug from earlier crawled out, now the size of a house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ugh…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dozens of bug legs crawling with rapid movements were too, vividly visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Woo Sae-geon hadn’t broken the silence by cutting off one leg with his sword in a single strike, I would have kept spacing out like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, as expected… this boss wasn’t easy to inflict damage on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An A-grade boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The snake-like body wasn’t easily cut or pierced. The legs regrew as fast as they were cut off. The successors struggled like never before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At least it’s fortunate that it’s not much of a threat as long as we don’t make contact.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The boss’s skin is fucking tough, damn.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho lost his composure and exploded in frustration. He had thrown dozens of hidden weapons but they all bounced off. The arrow I aimed precisely at its eyes was dodged by that damn boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Woo Sae-geon couldn’t rashly close the distance. Riding his ox familiar, he circled around while searching for the enemy’s openings with raptor-like eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time of being unable to do anything dragged on. We needed to stand proudly before the people, but at this rate, we’d be shameless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors’ prestige would be damaged, and… it would make people anxious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was clear that anxiety would be caused among citizens while news of successful conquest was delayed and silence lengthened. Communities would also buzz with fear and anxiety.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We must remember. Stages aren’t some special successor event.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is a war staking the survival and pride of Korean hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon made his decision.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as permission was granted, I immediately got down from the boar familiar. Since the height was high, I hesitated for a moment, then Hae Mi-jun quickly got down first and offered me his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho also left the boss to Woo Sae-geon and Myo Cho-hui and came to me for now. Since Ja Hyeong-woo remained on the boar, he would take care of healing those two.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I remembered discussing actions in advance with Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How do we naturally hold hands? Should I pretend to be in danger? You grab me and pull me away pretending…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘We can just hold hands normally. I’ll grab you while pretending to chat. Since we’re close, people will think it’s something like that.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when it came time to actually do it, I hesitated quite a bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was glancing at Sa Ye-ho approaching when I suddenly made an “ugh!” sound and crouched down on the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I suddenly act sick and crouch down, it’s natural for Sa Ye-ho to help me up, right? I’m always getting sick anyway.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I really was in pain. Honestly, this wasn’t expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s energy rushed in rapidly from the point of contact. It felt like a hot lump was moving around inside my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hngh, uh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t help but let out a small moan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho pretended to pat my back with his other hand while pushing the heat all the way in thoroughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People would say ‘Gang-tto-a (Gang-hyeon sick again).’ Like what I heard on the talk show… I’m glad I don’t look at communities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could feel Hae Mi-jun watching anxiously from the side. I steeled my heart once more and activated the ‘Grave of the Dead’ skill, then rolled the energy inside my body to process it into a new form.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I bit my lips so hard they bled, but it was almost done.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I just needed to stick this into the boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If the fusion skill turns out to be pathetic after trying it, I’ll really just shoot arrows until I cough up blood from next time… Then Woo Sae-geon might at least pity me…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I released the skill that had been circling and trapped inside my body to the outside—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly my vision turned yellow and bright red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire demons were surging from my body!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both I, who was engulfed in flames, and Sa Ye-ho, who witnessed me directly, screamed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the flames suddenly cleared. Something slipped out of me and rose into the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I frantically felt around my body. Fortunately, not only was there no burn, but not even a single piece of clothing was singed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then that is…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A bird… as large as the boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Each time it flapped its wings, scorching heat like being in front of a fire rushed over us. The flames were so intense that sweat beaded on my forehead in no time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A phoenix…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All its feathers were red and brilliant. Looking at that color, I felt like there might be a more appropriate name. I stared blankly before realizing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There are the twelve zodiac in the five elements, but above them are also the four guardian deities.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the four guardian deities, the position is south. In terms of the five elements, fire attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Vermillion Bird. In other words, Suzaku.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kiiiii—! The Vermillion Bird opened its beak and cried out. Sound waves echoed throughout the area and flames spewed forth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The large four-headed bug’s body instantly caught fire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the hard exterior that Sa Ye-ho couldn’t pierce even when he threw hidden weapons desperately earlier. Both Sa Ye-ho and Hae Mi-jun looked up stupidly like people whose souls had been stolen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Vermillion Bird deity didn’t particularly listen to my commands, but as if driving evil things to death was its very reason for existence, it drove the four-headed bug to its demise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The burning smell stung my nose. Pillars of fire rose from the four-headed bug’s entire body. The heat was so intense that even Woo Sae-geon retreated far back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho, your skill is amazing…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to pass it off belatedly, but it was too obvious that it was a skill that came from me, Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also know that I’ve crossed a river of no return.

  The fortunate thing was that Woo Sae-geon hadn’t used his advanced skill yet. If Woo Sae-geon’s skill had come out first just before this unprecedented emergency situation, one side would have been wasted, but that guy even has good luck.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  ‘But that means I can summon other guardian deities too. And I haven’t used the remaining guardian deities yet.’
