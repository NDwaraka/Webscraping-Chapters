 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once the stage number exceeded 30, Woo Sae-geon seemed to have gradually decided to trust the stage preliminary information given by the system. He began forming increasingly aggressive combinations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He organized teams centered around attributes advantageous against that stage’s monsters, boldly excluding other attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, departing from the existing method of overworking so-called elite top successors including himself, he deployed those who were still growing or had unbalanced builds and had rarely participated in raids to the attack team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For instance, Myo Cho-hui was excluded this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Jin Seol-woon was also excluded. Since Jin Seol-woon had used up almost all his skills in the previous stage, it was natural if anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…It’s only been about 10 stages, but for Yang Pyo to be selected again as a tanker replacing Jin Seol-woon is surprising. Woo Sae-geon must have judged it was okay.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not only that, I also discovered the name of a certain slacker on the roster whose training I’d never properly seen, let alone stage participation.

  ‘I’d like to see Sa Ye-ho fight with a weapon. I’m looking forward to it since I saw it in the original work.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Excluding Woo Sae-geon and Ja Hyeong-woo, this formation where the others were essentially gamble picks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When entering the stage entrance, the back of my head felt prickly so I turned around once. Sure enough, I made direct eye contact with Ja Hyeong-woo.

  If this kind of conversation gets caught on camera, discord rumors will spread. Chat was the right choice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s go in~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment even Sa Ye-ho, who wasn’t holding any weapon and was just dangling his empty hands, crossed the entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A visual shock hit hard. Blue, it was the ocean.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huk!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A shock like falling into water struck my entire body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey hey hey hey, what is this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Amid Sa Ye-ho’s confused question and Yang Pyo’s shout, a fishy saltiness burrowed into my lungs like poison gas.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I knew it, I was sitting down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other four were all fine. I was the only one gasping for breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had knelt on his right knee, immediately placed his hand on my heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Haa, ha.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I could breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without realizing it, I gripped Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand tightly and pressed it firmly against my heart. The blue light deepened. For now, this hand was the respirator that let me breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since this time’s monsters were in the sea, they wouldn’t attack first unless we approached the surface.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For me, it was heavenly luck. I had bought some time to rest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The attack team didn’t immediately enter combat and waited for a while until I calmed down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why is touching necessary when healing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After coming to my senses and swatting away Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand, I had been using Sa Ye-ho’s shoulder since there was nowhere else to lean on the sandy beach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been using me as an armrest all this time, generously offered his embrace too, having some conscience. But he was patting my head like he would a puppy, which only made me think I should recover quickly out of annoyance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s go now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Rest 10 more minutes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the unsympathetic Woo Sae-geon was thorough when it came to condition management. Despite his expression looking like he’d kill someone, he surprisingly didn’t rush us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ox Successor: I don’t know if you realize this is a stage with conditions favorable to earth attribute.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he did nag behind the scenes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By fielding me and Yang Pyo, Woo Sae-geon included as many as three earth attributes in this attack team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even considering that earth has more personnel than other attributes, it’s biased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, this stage’s background was the ocean.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the Five Elements, earth blocks the flow of water. In this stage, earth attribute had the advantage of suppressing water, so as Woo Sae-geon said, this was a stage favorable to earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But even Woo Sae-geon probably didn’t expect my body to be this much garbage.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s something like dot damage? A debuff throughout this stage. But Gang-hyeon hyung is earth and has a familiar too, so it’s a bit…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tanker Yang Pyo had just analyzed and read the space with a simple sweep of his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he doesn’t realize that’s not something just anyone can do, he probably thinks he lacks talent as a tanker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My skin still seemed to be throbbing. I slowly took deep breaths.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even Sa Ye-ho, who’s fire and weak to water, is fine, but what’s wrong with me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, being this weak, how will you get married later?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s mouth chattered above my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I asked for something else to lean on, Sa Ye-ho was now hugging me from behind with both arms wrapped around like doing the Heimlich maneuver. Not knowing how disgusted Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression was as he healed me from the front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze… seems to be like that because he finds it disgusting to look at.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I was drooping like a doll, Sa Ye-ho looked very relaxed. I hate to admit it, but Sa Ye-ho also hides muscles under his straight hanbok skirt. It just doesn’t show because his build is slim.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh how embarrassing~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know whether Sa Ye-ho takes my side or Woo Sae-geon’s more… but it’s certain he’s not my enemy at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he’s deliberately turning this part into a laughing matter, controlling so that the fierce criticism from people who’ll watch the recording later won’t be directed at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s even performing tricks so we won’t be bored.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or not. It might just be that he caught something to tease me about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m really okay now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grabbed Sa Ye-ho’s arms and separated my body that had been stuck to him. I signaled that I was fine and we should proceed with the attack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Sheep Successor&gt;Me: People seem like they’ll curse at you…

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo sent me a private chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His face when we met was full of worry. Even though he knows I’ve long since stopped caring about external reactions. Unnecessary worry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I get cursed at, it can’t be helped. I brought this on myself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I couldn’t tell anyone, my real goal today was separate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today I deliberately joined here to be a burden.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I lack defense, but I can’t use the dog familiar due to circumstances. I can’t use the mouse familiar either since I’d get caught.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, a harsh situation was created where Ja Hyeong-woo had to continuously supply me with low-grade heals while also taking care of teammates in that state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rocky terrain with uneven surfaces. Unlike the spacious areas in gates we’d seen before, the range where we could set foot here was limited enough to take in with our eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because below the cliff where we stood was all seawater.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While front-line Yang Pyo hesitated briefly, Woo Sae-geon smoothly blocked him with his arm and stepped forward from his original east position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He stared at the deep water surface where the bottom couldn’t be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho. Look into it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was already beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From Sa Ye-ho looking down below the water surface, energy shaped like flames sparked up. I could see it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The precursor effect before a successor uses a skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Snake’s Eyes (Fire Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides Myo Cho-hui, there was another Twelve Zodiac successor with detection skills. If Myo Cho-hui sees life energy, Sa Ye-ho detects heat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After using his skill, Sa Ye-ho covered both eyes tightly with his hands like someone watching a horror movie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s with covering your eyes when it’s supposed to be a seeing skill?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “These snake eyes are gross.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Sa Ye-ho removed his hands and turned around. His eyes, returned to their original form, smiled with satisfaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “About 120 small fries. The boss is also down there. If we’re not careful, they’ll all come up together, you know? What are you going to do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon looked around Sa Ye-ho, Yang Pyo, Ja Hyeong-woo, and me at a glance without wavering. His lips opened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there anything else but killing them all?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the only and clearest solution.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As long as they’re here to fight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As long as they’re called successors and trying to prove that name every moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once again Woo Sae-geon’s eyes swept the water surface. His gaze, feeling colder than seawater, was more reliable than anything when directed at hidden monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They have no intention of coming up first. Yang Pyo, bring out your familiar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo momentarily made a crumpled face as if he’d ‘gotten caught at a bad time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the hesitation didn’t last long. Yang Pyo was now a tanker who had overcome his phobia to some extent, still anxious but with strengthened resolve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had approached close to the water surface, took a deep breath. He whistled lightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump―!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The summoning succeeded. A massive form appeared above Yang Pyo’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Peculiarly, the sheep familiar had the giant horns and head of a mountain goat, with only the upper body clearly visible while gradually becoming hazier toward the lower body until it disappeared completely. Despite its half-remaining appearance, its size was as large as a mythical animal. Not only was it as big as a decent building, but it was comparable to large boss monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then it was Woo Sae-geon’s turn.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he moved his steps near Yang Pyo, a small amount of energy that even I had difficulty identifying spread across the ground. That alone made the area stir once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire ground resonated, making my feet stagger. The earth tremor that started from Woo Sae-geon rumbled through heaven and earth, creating water splashes even on the surface.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Epicenter of Eruption (Earth Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A skill Woo Sae-geon possessed. Like a volcanic eruption, his presence spread throughout heaven and earth. A kind of warning and provocation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was impossible for monsters to feel that tremor and still defy Woo Sae-geon’s provocation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, even if they came up, they’d all die to Woo Sae-geon anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kiii―! The monsters rose to the water surface.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing their half-formed human-like crushed heads, hideous features, and scale tails rippling below their upper bodies, I realized what kind of monsters they were.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Mermaids. Water attribute monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mermaids floating on the water all opened their mouths in unison. Their mouth corners split wide to both sides of their faces, and sharp teeth glinted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the mermaids crawled up the cliff in clusters, the danger increased rapidly. The mermaids that came out of water soon grew legs. Legs covered in scales moved swiftly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kiik! They rushed forward making spine-chilling sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo the tanker went “Hic!” and hiccupped. Seeing startled Yang Pyo, I attempted a joke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho, those guys look like you. Smile like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crazy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo went “Puhup,” and laughed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not stopping there, I raised my bow. Swish! An arrow cut through the wind and pierced into one mermaid’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you just going to watch?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until recently, I was still the person who helped with his phobia.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Show-off…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo grumbled. But his voice had more strength than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Realizing that change, I smiled.
 </span>
</p>
