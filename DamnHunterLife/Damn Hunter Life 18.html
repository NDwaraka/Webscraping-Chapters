  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 18
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, an S-grade weapon was too precious for me. Plus it had a weird name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I couldn’t immediately accept it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The idea that when Jin Seol-woon made my weapon, he thought about giving back what he’d received and made it for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For me, who had been nothing but trouble.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly I heard sounds from beyond Jin Seol-woon’s front yard, so I couldn’t think about it any further.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t Jin Seol-woon who had just left. Since it’s a guest, they wouldn’t stride right inside and would just pace around out front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dark blue bangs covering his forehead fluttered in the breeze. The hair tied up with a handkerchief and the wide Hwarang clothing along with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is the original protagonist showing up here?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s probably already at the training ground. I should have given it to him there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, muttering to himself, took something out of his inventory and set it down in a visible spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a magic stone from a gate. Already proven worldwide as a new material being traded at high prices, while also being used as expensive point exchange vouchers within Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He probably stopped by to give Jin Seol-woon physical points. Like a good colleague, with good intentions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Ja Hyeong-woo just turned his head sideways, he’d inevitably discover me, but it’s fine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Boundary Between Life and Death (Water Attribute)&gt; skill activates.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d already turned on the stealth skill long ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Anyway, nice weapon. I’ll use it well, homeowner.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having received the weapon and having no business with Ja Hyeong-woo, I immediately used the return function.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next moment I was in my house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon……?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other person seemed to have no thought that Ja Hyeong-woo would see him, looking comfortably elsewhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t immediately call out to him was because he was making a face he’d never seen before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He looked happy. That Gyeon Gang-hyeon – with his small, pale face that looked like it would break at any moment, who always colored his face with irritation whenever he saw Ja Hyeong-woo – was smiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Grinning as if he’d received some big gift, Ja Hyeong-woo had no way of knowing it was because of the weapon Jin Seol-woon had given him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He really hadn’t smiled like that in front of him since they were very young. Seeing that smile again as adults, it felt different from the old days somehow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Ja Hyeong-woo perceived Gyeon Gang-hyeon as pretty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the first time saliva had pooled under his tongue from looking at a person rather than food.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And that was from looking at a man, an old friend, and furthermore someone he’d been doing nothing but growling at recently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that instant, Ja Hyeong-woo was strongly bound to the other person. Nothing came to mind except the desire to preserve that smiling face in his memory. As if paralyzed, he couldn’t move for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why he came to his senses late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wait… why are you here?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He took a few loud steps forward trying to catch Gyeon Gang-hyeon. But Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s form blurring came first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His outstretched hand stopped uselessly in midair. Only Ja Hyeong-woo remained alone in the front yard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Must be the return function.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only skill usable even by non-awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Gyeon Gang-hyeon would be at his house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In his anger, he almost used teleportation on Gyeon Gang-hyeon like last time but barely regained his reason. Going to the training ground had somehow become an afterthought. He needed to find out why Gyeon Gang-hyeon had been at the Dragon successor’s house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He was smiling.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why did he smile? What made him happy? That question relentlessly tormented Ja Hyeong-woo. What was there to smile about at Jin Seol-woon’s house?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Making an expression he’d never made in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To say he’d been secretly there to cause trouble for Jin Seol-woon…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Recently, hadn’t there only been beneficial things for Jin Seol-woon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that he’d finally posted a simple letter to fans and a song video since becoming a hunter, the fans’ enthusiastic support for this, even positive reactions from the general public. Even Ja Hyeong-woo, who didn’t look at the internet directly, knew about it from hearing it through the grapevine – Jin Seol-woon’s story had been that famous recently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s change for the better. And Gyeon Gang-hyeon smiling while holding an unfamiliar sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What this uncomfortable feeling, this irritating mood was. Even though it was his own heart, Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t understand it at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His steps walking to the training ground weren’t straight but wavering. It was the kind of thing that would lead to several posts on the Twelve Zodiac community asking ‘Did something bad happen to Ja Hyeong-woo?’ but he himself didn’t care.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like he wouldn’t be able to focus on anything else until he heard it directly from the homeowner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He entered the successor gym, a space with a maximum capacity of 12 people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, wearing workout clothes instead of his robe, gave a sharp hint with just his eyes. Meaning he was late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, ignoring even the leader’s reproach, looked around quickly. He gestured to Jin Seol-woon in his short-sleeved shirt to come out to the bathroom corridor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though they were close enough to have each other’s backs in combat for tactical reasons, these two men normally had absolutely no casual conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had felt an ominous feeling from his hardened face, wanted to hold his head when Ja Hyeong-woo said he’d seen Gyeon Gang-hyeon in front of his house just moments ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Maybe it’s fortunate. If I’d left even 5 minutes later, he would have seen the two of us together.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression, he seemed to be thoroughly misunderstanding Gyeon Gang-hyeon as some kind of thief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had to clarify, if only due to slight guilt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know what Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi is thinking, but it’s not like that. Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi helped me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he said he’d been helped, when the other person’s face hardened further, Jin Seol-woon was inwardly flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being sensitive to human relationships and people’s emotions, if there was one thing he instinctively caught from looking at Ja Hyeong-woo in front of him, it was this:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between this person and Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, there are complex and subtle emotions that outsiders don’t know about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How about asking directly? It doesn’t seem like something I should be revealing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, making a quick judgment, chose to step back. He didn’t forget to thank him for the gate magic stone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stood nailed to that spot without any movement for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the vague answer allowed him to roughly guess the situation, he wasn’t any clearer than before knowing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only deep resentment remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I see. He helped Seol-woon. Your influence went into the Dragon successor starting to sing again recently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And when it went well as he hoped, he was secretly smiling behind the scenes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘While telling me to just train to death.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he didn’t even know Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I just someone who only needs to train for you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Twelve Zodiac skill training ground was famous as a place where the lights never went out 24 hours a day. Despite being used by the fewest people among all training grounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, even within that, the figures who kept the training ground from cooling down were limited to some.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Attribute training was usually explained as a battle with oneself. Other attribute awakened couldn’t teach you, and there was no other method besides personally stirring up the energy within your body, concentrating and devoting yourself – a realm of talent and sincerity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage 26 was imminent. Ja Hyeong-woo had been in meditation for three days trying to increase his affinity with his attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone’s footsteps approached, breaking the stillness that had settled in the quiet space. Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t open his eyes. While even the sensation of thick sweat drops flowing down his temples was distant, only the other person’s voice reached him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re confident you can manage your condition, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tone felt pressuring, as if saying he’d curse him to his face if he was damaging his body recklessly. Without changing his posture, Ja Hyeong-woo quietly replied “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There are interview requests that came for you. Send them all to me. I’ll write rejection responses.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon directly managed all successors’ external activities except for the Dog successor. The association also had managers to handle successors, but Woo Sae-geon didn’t trust them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And for good reason – outside was full of greedy hyenas. There were rumors that several entertainment companies were lying in wait to immediately offer modeling contracts or whatever the moment Ja Hyeong-woo and Myo Cho-hui retired.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was also a company that tried to put PPL advertisements in stage battle videos but only got cursed out by Woo Sae-geon and gave up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After roughly reviewing documents through the status window, Woo Sae-geon closed the window with increasingly irritated eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll handle trash like this myself, so you just train properly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t particularly answer, but Woo Sae-geon knew it would be affirmative anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Woo Sae-geon’s case, the sunken, dark-looking eye sockets were supposedly just features he’d had since birth—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at his eyes, Ja Hyeong-woo thought that at some point his own under-eyes had become darker than his.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, he didn’t rest from training. Believing he could hold out until Stage 26, he devoted himself to refining his attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whew……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But currently, Ja Hyeong-woo’s judgment was seriously unclear. His mind was in a state close to irrationality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With continued sleep deprivation, the shock Gyeon Gang-hyeon had given him pulled the trigger on that judgment. He was so focused on training even more fiercely to avoid dwelling on Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The morning of Stage 26 arrived.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who woke up after sleeping exactly 7 hours, fell into the delusion that his sleep was sufficient.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside Hunter School, in front of the gate leading to the stage, leader Woo Sae-geon looked back. At the 4-person raid team he was supposed to lead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ox Successor: You know without me saying.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ox Successor: Today’s goal is to close Stage 26. But beyond that, we need to show a composed appearance. Our duty is weighty.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ox Successor: Don’t forget.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the situation was broadcast live to citizens up to the entrance like other places, intimate talk was done through chat instead of speech.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo blinked several times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The text appearing in his eyes was strangely blurry. Puzzled by this, he was raising his hand to rub his eyes—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly his shoulder hit the wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he could realize that was the floor, his vision went dark.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the loud sound, all four people who had been standing in formation looked toward Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, finding Ja Hyeong-woo’s face on the floor rather than upright, shouted without knowing it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That idiot……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the skill-created veil disappeared from the collapsed face, Woo Sae-geon instinctively gave orders before even grasping the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cover him. With your back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So those dark circles don’t show on camera.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an order directed at Yang Pyo, the Sheep successor who wasn’t part of the raid team but had come to see them off. Yang Pyo, the largest among the successors, hurriedly crouched down and dragged Ja Hyeong-woo away while covering him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon concentrated all his nerves on managing his expression while turning his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The plan was already half-ruined. Having collapsed right before the stage, there was no way to prevent controversy over Ja Hyeong-woo’s condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then at minimum, they had to finish this stage smoothly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But with the only healer out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original members Jin Seol-woon, Myo Cho-hui, and Ma Cheon-ah all looked at Woo Sae-geon simultaneously with widened eyes. Woo Sae-geon opened his mouth under the gaze of colleagues who were all younger than him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’re modifying the raid team itself. Excluding the healer, with 2 tankers and 3 dealers from the original candidates.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Snake successor Sa Ye-ho would have to come immediately, but Woo Sae-geon couldn’t think that guy would be ready for combat at all. But he couldn’t blame Sa Ye-ho’s leisureliness. Originally Sa Ye-ho had been excluded from the raid, and this situation itself was sudden—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Hae’ Successor has teleported.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this time, a person Woo Sae-geon hadn’t expected appeared before them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he’d moved hastily after seeing the situation in real time, his light blue Nangdo robe was slightly wrinkled and the feather on his head was crooked. But it was clearly Hae Mi-jun properly dressed in hunter gear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Gyeon Gang-hyeon was the disgrace of successors, Hae Mi-jun was the sore finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The 17-year-old youngest, who until now had neither the skill nor confidence to participate in raids, looked up at Woo Sae-geon and spoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Steadying his trembling, in a quiet voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll substitute. Trust me and use me just this once.”
