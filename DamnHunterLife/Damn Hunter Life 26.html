  While most successors were recovering and regular hunters were refraining from activities to mourn colleagues who died in this gate, the school was quietly lifeless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

  In a dim room inside a traditional Korean house.

  Ja Hyeong-woo called out to the one lying on the bed like the dead.

  As heavy as the childhood memories he kept.

  Until now even though he was fucking annoying, we just left him alone since he didn’t work

  But if he’s awakened now the story’s different.

  Here comes the JHY GGH childhood friends theory again [346]
 </span>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   When GGH comes up in interviews, JHY’s facial muscles twitch and he consistently says “I won’t answer.” Shows agitation.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   They have the same birthplace and same elementary school. (Different middle and high schools)
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   JHY is extremely T-type, stays calm while healing anyone who gets hurt. But when GGH vomited blood this time, he looked at him with a totally shocked face.
  </span>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  + Look at comments saying “If you zoom in the video the quality gets shit and all expressions get blurred, isn’t this just delusion?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The staff JHY dropped was glowing by itself, that’s JHY using heal. But the skill not activating means he used up all his skill counts. He knows he used them all but keeps trying, that’s because he was shocked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Hae Mi-jun’s healing skill recharged, he teleported to Gang-hyeon’s house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hyeong-woo hyung said he was taking care of him…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the world-spinning sensation passed and he opened his eyes, Hae Mi-jun was in Gang-hyeon’s room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You came.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was startled looking at the bed. Ja Hyeong-woo had removed Gang-hyeon’s upper clothing and laid him down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He glanced at Ja Hyeong-woo, but his expression was calm. It seemed like Hae Mi-jun was the only one feeling awkward here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If it was someone other than Gang-hyeon hyung, he definitely wouldn’t have touched their clothes…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, skin contact isn’t particularly necessary for using healing skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when Hae Mi-jun trained with Ja Hyeong-woo before and needed contact for attribute guidance, Ja Hyeong-woo politely suggested undressing and kept touching to a minimum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then is it because he’s close with Gang-hyeon hyung?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But for that, Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression wasn’t good. Rather than being because Gang-hyeon hyung was hurt, there seemed to be some fundamental distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun sneakily raised his gaze to face Gang-hyeon again. After all, he was a patient who needed treatment, so he should look properly. That’s how he convinced himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The upper body he saw for the first time was heartbreakingly thin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet the body’s form and pale skin tone didn’t make him think it looked bad. Rather—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Pink…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was startled by his own unconscious thought. He lowered his head to hide his rapidly reddening cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo seemed not to notice Hae Mi-jun’s condition as he stepped back slightly and gestured forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I healed the damaged insides with my skill. It’s your turn.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Ja Hyeong-woo had treated the severely damaged interior, Hae Mi-jun had to restore the depleted stamina so Gang-hyeon could open his eyes and move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun held his palm above Gang-hyeon’s upper chest. Blue light spread evenly over Gang-hyeon’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun soon looked puzzled. The stamina recovery skill didn’t work on the target.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, frowning deeply, stepped closer to examine. Hae Mi-jun trembled like someone who had committed a crime.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is, is it because I’m lacking? Then Gang-hyeon hyung because of me…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tears welled up instantly, but faster than they could flow down his cheeks, Ja Hyeong-woo identified the cause.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look carefully. The light from the skill isn’t absorbing, it’s just floating on top.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He pointed with his finger and explained quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not that he’s not getting better despite using the skill, but that it’s not your jurisdiction.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was a good healer teacher. Even in this situation, he was calmly giving guidance to Hae Mi-jun as a senior.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to Ja Hyeong-woo’s words that he’s not a target for skill use, Gang-hyeon’s current state is one of two things. Either Gang-hyeon is already in a healthy state. Or Gang-hyeon’s body is fundamentally in a realm where skills can’t boost vitality…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unfortunately, there was no way to know the answer right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo judged that instead of skills, nutritional IV drip injections purchasable from the Hunter School shop would be effective. Even though there was nothing else he could particularly do, he stayed by his side the whole time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, Gang-hyeon regained consciousness on his own in less than three days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head was too hazy, like I had died and come back to life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s because I did too much.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was also the first time I had vomited blood like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now having Ja Hyeong-woo by the bedside wasn’t a surprising phenomenon anymore. Ja Hyeong-woo just stared silently as if waiting for me to notice him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried moving my shoulders a little and realized. My upper body was bare.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I flinched and pulled the blanket around my waist to cover my body. Then Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression became strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know I just did something weird between guys, but it’s embarrassing to be seen by that bastard of all people. Because I’m too white and thin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You seem fine with moving. Say anything. Can you speak?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because I was a patient, his tone was quite gentle even to me who had that kind of conversation with him in front of the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hmm…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the events in front of the gate came back to me, my body, which had seemed fully recovered, trembled minutely again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I accepted the weight that successors bear in Korea as my own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I desperately tried to get hurt instead of Ja Hyeong-woo… things like that came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned away from Ja Hyeong-woo’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You can curse me as an ungrateful bastard, a bad bastard, I don’t care. Even if you hold a grudge and try to get revenge on me later, I’ll accept it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right now I can’t handle your existence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Covering my tired eyes with my arm, I inevitably brought out the most vicious and annoying tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aren’t you going to train? How long are you going to rest?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The effect was certain as always. Ja Hyeong-woo’s face, which had been gently relaxed, immediately hardened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And I’m telling you again, sleep properly. Don’t collapse again and cause trouble then say it’s because of me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had come close, suddenly pulled the blanket off my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body briefly shrank from the cold air touching my skin. I tried to cover myself with my arms but Ja Hyeong-woo covered my arms with the blanket too and pulled it up to my neck. Then he glared at me and spoke clearly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if the sky falls I’ll sleep 6 hours a day, so speak nicely.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…This rat bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Half reflexively, half sincerely, I spat out even harsher words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Ja Hyeong-woo left the room, he glanced back from the doorway. His gaze was off to be looking at me, but his eyes were too fierce to be looking somewhere else entirely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll wait at the successor training ground.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was wondering what he meant and watching quietly when I heard the next words too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You awakened. Come try it once. That thing called training.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …This bastard holds a grudge against me.
