  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 87

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at it, vines had spread throughout the entire training ground. Not just me, but everyone had received the same surprise attack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An incident that occurred in a place where no one expected to be attacked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Each person’s response method could be roughly divided into three types according to their usual combat style or individual agility level.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Either they quickly protected themselves with familiars like Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or they struck them down with weapons they were familiar with, like Ma Cheon-ah or Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun nimbly threw his body to the ground to dodge. Even after dodging, he looked up in bewilderment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo just didn’t dodge. It seems he’s developed a habit of not dodging even when he sees attacks coming, probably because of his Invincible Body characteristic. Of course, even though he got whipped by the vines, there wasn’t a trace of damage. He was just very surprised.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wait a minute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You guys are all well-trained in combat, huh…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was I the only one destined to not dodge and die?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho giggled in my ear. I was still floating in the air. Because Sa Ye-ho was holding me and had landed on one of the thick vines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy with top-tier mobility stats had the speed and balance sense to save even me in that short time, and amazingly, he didn’t even drop his phone in the process.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I became aware of it later, the ground below my feet was dizzying. I managed my expression to not show my nervousness, but Sa Ye-ho kept grinning. Right, with our bodies touching, there’s no way he wouldn’t notice the tension…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you want to keep holding me like this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm. You’re soft and smell nice?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah fuck, I’ll just fall then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey hey, okay.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the dizziness and everything disappeared. I struggled, thinking it would be better to just jump to my death, and only then did he put me down on the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway… the culprit who threw everyone into confusion was actually obvious. No matter whose gaze you followed, it would all lead to one destination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Myo Cho-hui’s expression, who was the cause—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She looked completely surprised, so it definitely wasn’t intentional. Myo Cho-hui kept her mouth tightly shut. All she did was stare blankly at the training ground that had become a mess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the silence, no one could bring themselves to speak to Myo Cho-hui first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, Sa Ye-ho’s eyes slowly rolled to scan everyone once, then he casually let words slip.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow noona, that was good just now. It was the best training for us who had gotten loose. Anyone who couldn’t dodge properly just now should do supplementary training.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should not come back after going to the bathroom later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Myo Cho-hui came to her senses and withdrew the vines. Then she looked at everyone one by one and apologized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. I really did make a mistake. Sorry for making it dangerous.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s okay…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Rabbit unni, don’t be discouraged! There are tons of people here who are worse!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri and Ma Cheon-ah comforted her, saying it was fine. Jin Seol-woon, Yang Pyo, and the younger ones brushed it off as nothing and started their training again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, some of us here… Sa Ye-ho, who’s part of the senior group and an original Twelve Zodiac member, and I, who know the original story, see through the truth Myo Cho-hui is hiding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Myo Cho-hui apologized, it couldn’t be the result of genuinely feeling remorse toward others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside, there would only be irritation that she made a mistake worth being criticized for. True to her nature of wearing the well-made mask of a socialite, Myo Cho-hui only puts on sociability while being mindful of her mission as the Twelve Zodiac mascot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If she can’t control her abilities to this extent, there’s no reason other than her emotions being greatly shaken at that moment.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Including Jin Seol-woon, who was looking carefully, several others besides me probably could have reasoned this far.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But speculation gets blocked at the next step.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What exactly was the reason?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An ordinary training scene after Woo Sae-geon and Ja Hyeong-woo left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that brief moment, what could have happened to shake Myo Cho-hui’s mind?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Civilian parents are safe, but Hunter Kim×× is currently in critical condition and requesting support from healing-type hunters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had been reading breaking news out loud earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If she was shaken by hearing that, it all adds up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Sa Ye-ho was also quick to catch on. He followed my speculation.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho demonstrated multitasking by talking about how some latest game was incredibly fun while chatting about something else behind the scenes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I decided to nod and move past this topic for now. Woo Sae-geon wasn’t here anyway, and it wasn’t worth making a big deal about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there’s one more thing here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Didn’t I say I know the original story?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So there are things I know better than Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Could it be…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A clue from the original story flashed through my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From what just happened, one hypothesis about Myo Cho-hui was established. Perhaps I might be the first among the successors to… figure out the real inner nature of the person called Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [STAGE 35 has been cleared.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo and four others came out after completing the raid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to system rules, the video is confirmed the moment the clear notification appears, and immediately Hunter School people can view that video.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And then this video is transmitted to the Association and delivered to the citizens who are eagerly waiting for the successors’ activities. Showing the long-awaited process of the successors clearing stages.
 </span>
</p>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if someone might come humming without even watching the video, our leader added words like assigning a book report.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How ridiculous. If they knew how much I can figure out from just one raid video, they couldn’t say that.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if things like energy flow don’t show in recorded videos, there are parts you can learn through theory and analysis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to abandon my training and use a return home skill when someone suddenly popped out from the doorway and stood in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Phew… you haven’t left yet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun seemed to have run at full speed, bowing his head and catching his breath. Even during that, he held onto my sleeve tightly as if I might leave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Maybe, I mean, would you… watch this stage with me? At, at my house?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He managed to finish speaking with that timid personality of his. As I waited patiently, his face, still with baby fat, turned bright red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Watching stages is work, so it’s not like “let’s watch a movie.” Does he want to talk while watching together?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, it’s uncomfortable. Not that Hae Mi-jun is uncomfortable, but having someone next to me when watching raids becomes troublesome. There would be parts where I’d have to pretend to be stupid on purpose, and I can’t spread out my original story notes either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I seemed to hesitate, Hae Mi-jun’s cheeks got a bit redder. Now he didn’t know what to do, feeling sorry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I-if it’s difficult, it’s really okay! Besides, asking you to come to my house was presumptuous—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you talking about? Sure, let’s go to your house.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I answered readily, Hae Mi-jun’s face brightened up completely. He’s so happy like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What if I had said no? If his motivation dropped due to the embarrassment of being rejected and feeling sorry toward me, and he kept thinking about it during training, and his skills deteriorated, ultimately causing problems with his growth curve?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun is probably the type who needs continuous mental care because he has a weak heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s house was a bit smaller than mine, but surprisingly spacious. Since he didn’t greatly change the circular hanok, you could feel the wooden atmosphere, while modern furniture was arranged in appropriately matching colors. He had quite a sense for interior design.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please sit here!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun guided me to the sofa in front of the screen, then had me sit comfortably, gave me a cushion to hold, and even covered me with a blanket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Such devoted service, man. Come sit down.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Would you like some ice cream?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Red bean flavor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rested my chin deeply on the large cushion and waited for the screen to turn on. Hae Mi-jun glanced at me like that, and only sat down when I gestured with my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not on the sofa, but kneeling at the low table in front of it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the successors on screen were entering the entrance, Hae Mi-jun maintained a stiffly formal posture and watched the screen respectfully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Do you always watch like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about a cushion?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun couldn’t answer and turned his head to avoid it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right… Even he would be too embarrassed to say it honestly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The days of looking at the hyungs and noonas fighting at the front lines while thinking he was inadequate and bowing his head, the habit of foolishly kneeling on the cold floor without even a cushion to study videos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I’m comfortable here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Comfortable? Then should I come down too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? No! I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I pretended to throw off the blanket and come down, only then did Hae Mi-jun jump up and listen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He came up next to me hesitantly and sat down with his knees neatly together. Completely different from me leaning crookedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His stiff posture still bothered me, so I nitpicked for no reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why aren’t you eating ice cream?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was worried my attitude might become improper…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I improper?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I held the bar ice cream I was eating close to Hae Mi-jun’s mouth as he waved his hands in denial.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then take a bite.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
