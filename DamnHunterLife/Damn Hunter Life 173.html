  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 173
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An unexpected stroke of luck rolled in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the things I had to do tomorrow morning, the most unpleasant one was resolved. Since it’s Yoon Sae-geon, he’ll definitely keep his word once he’s said it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put down my phone and raised my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who I thought was sleeping, had his eyes open and was looking at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart dropped for a moment. His serious gaze without a trace of sleepiness collided with my skin. Ja Hyeong-woo’s mouth opened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry. I’m stupid, so I can’t be of any help at times like this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why are you saying that in the middle of sleeping?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wish I were a more reliable person.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so calmly at that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strangely, while receiving Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze, my heart that had been sharpened with anxiety seemed to become round. The silence that originated from Ja Hyeong-woo was affectionate. The tension that had blocked my throat was washed away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why aren’t you helpful?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked surprised.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A beat later, I was also startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah shit. Ah shit… I made a major slip of the tongue. I must have misspoken for a moment because I was struggling and tired.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To recover from this cringiness… I barely managed to cover it up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You give me treatment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gentle smile bloomed at Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips. He spread both arms toward me while lying down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re grateful that I kiss you every day?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won’t you shut up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While growling, I hesitantly entered the space between his arms. I was still sleepy and needed a heater.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shivering dry body gradually spread into the hot body temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Following the steady breathing, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body repeatedly rippled and subsided like calm water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quietly lifted his eyelids to savor the peace given to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was using Ja Hyeong-woo’s arm as a pillow. In his sleep, he placed his outer hand on Ja Hyeong-woo’s stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo subtly extended his thick ankle. Under the blanket, he slightly entangled it with the white, slender ankle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stimulation, excitement, and warmth mixed overwhelmingly, making his body feel hot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood circulated too quickly in his body. The pulsation throughout his body was intense. To the point of having the ridiculous thought that Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s skin might bruise from the pounding beats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just looking at someone can make your chest and throat tingle. The sensation of not being able to breathe because someone is precious also exists in this world. There’s also the phenomenon where even the simple action of taking a deep breath becomes addictive when you’re with someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He understood that strange truths that could never be realized alone all become reality in this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s shallow breathing hit his bare chest. Ja Hyeong-woo gathered his index and middle fingers to stroke Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s soft forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He seems comfortable when he’s with me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s gradually accepting affection. Does he know that his face already softens when looking at me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When this is over, when I retire, will Gang-hyeon accept me? He makes me harbor expectations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If the weight of the world pressing down on Gang-hyeon decreases.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes, staring into space, took on a chillingly sharp aura.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He witnessed directly through recent events. That Gang-hyeon had been preparing to handle such situations for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon was particularly concerned about the future. He tried to train me excessively too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since that was the same even before Gyeon Gang-hyeon became leader, Ja Hyeong-woo vaguely assumed that Gyeon Gang-hyeon might see the future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Or maybe he’s afraid. He doesn’t want to lose the future he finally grasped.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Gyeon Gang-hyeon never told him anything, Ja Hyeong-woo believed he was a special and excellent person. He believed alone even when no one else believed. That’s why he used to give him sharp criticism in the past.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You unconsciously said you’d save me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I’ll save you first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked at his status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The late-night highway was quiet. The bone-cutting wind of late winter roughly struck the concrete.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the dry ground beside it, a pitifully crushed form was revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The body already ruined by earth now crumbled even more from passing through the system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A body that seemed made by clumping earth rose from the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong crawled into the nearest visible grass. Even grass contaminated with exhaust and gas was grateful. He sucked in the power contained in the grass.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The surrounding life withered and twisted dry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong, who barely regained the appearance of a boy, slowly opened his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I need to push harder.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The system that Beom I-ryeong had infiltrated had various functions damaged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This seems familiar somewhere. Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was fixing the system like hitting iron with a hammer, eventually recalled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A computer that’s been visited by a hacker? Why is this so realistic?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, he organized the messed-up system. He fixed it to work normally again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I think I have more talent for this than expected. Should I learn computers after I retire?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I can retire safely. Gyeon Gang-hyeon thought additionally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong was erased from the successor list. Yoon Sae-geon, borrowing Sa Ye-ho’s face, reached an agreement with the Association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During this time, Gyeon Gang-hyeon managed the school, continued training, and paid attention to the power flowing in his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Time until the next stage passed quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The number ahead was 11.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On a certain day in February, all news in South Korea broadcast breaking news.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gates have occurred simultaneously across the nation. A total of 11 gates have been confirmed, with more than half revealed to be A-rank high-grade gates.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“A total of 26 casualties occurred from gate breaks. All casualties have been transported to hospitals…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“News has come that Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon will deploy all successors except for two reserves. When successors arrive, regular hunters will cooperate with rescue teams to begin rescue operations.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If breaking news talked about damage, other broadcasts had experts come out to discuss the current situation. People trembling with anxiety at home switched channels one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“With Successor Woo Sae-geon’s retirement, Korea’s 1st place disappeared. All rankings from 2nd place shifted down by one, which seemed like regression.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“However, for nearly 4 months, S-rank hunters’ world rankings have continuously risen. Successors don’t stop growing even at this moment.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Looking at current successors, it wouldn’t be insufficient to say this is hunters’ golden age.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This way is the evacuation route!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People rushed toward the direction hunters pointed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Black fear filled the eyes of a man who stood still in a daze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thick smoke rose from various spots in his vision. Screams for help continued to be heard from half-destroyed buildings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gates’ progression was too fast. Fast enough that hideous monsters crawling out of entrances was faster than the system’s matching speed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone frantically called home while running, someone wandered the streets without leaving while looking for friends.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A-rank monsters rushed to devour people, and hunters held out blocking monsters until people could evacuate. Each time they clashed weapons with monsters, scratches spread rapidly across their bodies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, another monster burst from the entrance and attacked people who couldn’t escape in time. Hunters jumped in belatedly but were outmatched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though time passed, there was no impact on his body. The man quietly opened his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whew—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a tremendous roar as if a truck had collided, but in front of him stood an ordinary person nonchalantly. No, he was too big to call ordinary. And he wore simple-colored hanbok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man who had just been rescued couldn’t help but open his mouth as he looked up at Yang Pyo. His head tilted back endlessly as if looking up at Mount Tai.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Following that, a clear voice was gently added.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hold it just like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small frame that seemed like it would only be half of Yang Pyo’s size. However, powerful force was loaded into the spear she held.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui descended from above, swinging her glaive in a large trajectory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She lightly avoided the monster’s claws just by twisting her body, and circled around repeatedly as if sprinting. It was hard to believe she was on the weaker side in mobility among successors, she was so quick.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unless it’s a spirit monster, life energy flows through monsters too. Myo Cho-hui, the only wood attribute user, could clearly see into the target’s energy. Therefore, she used the opponent’s power in reverse to produce stronger energy than what she possessed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while being led away by the hunter’s hand, the man’s head didn’t turn forward. He couldn’t take his eyes off them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There are only two…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For successor fans, meeting successors in person was both luck and tremendous misfortune.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Places where successors would appear were disaster sites where you’d have terrible experiences no matter how well you looked at it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, if you saw successors like now, not seeing more successors was clearly closer to luck than misfortune.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It meant that even with just two going to one area, it was sufficient to handle gates that regular hunters couldn’t even match.
 </span>
