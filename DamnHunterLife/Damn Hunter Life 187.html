  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 187

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did it say I had to deduce it myself?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then let me guess and try to get it right. I looked back on the path I had traveled so far. I recalled everything the status window had said to me all this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window had provoked me, mocked me, and said spine-chilling things…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…There’s still something bothering me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But before dealing with the status window, an ominous thing I had forgotten came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The black entrance I had seen still hadn’t appeared. Not until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tension that had barely relaxed became sharp again. I gripped Hyeong-woo’s arm tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stage inside the gate was mysterious enough, but there had been a triple entrance inside even that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Hyeong-woo turned his body while holding me. As if trying to protect me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In front of me and Hyeong-woo, a black-colored crack had formed. Like a door that suddenly appeared in mid-air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Different text appeared in the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If there were also monsters and bosses inside this? We’re both exhausted, so could we really handle them? Although the preliminary information that just appeared didn’t mention monsters, you never know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the logic Hyeong-woo had tried to use to persuade me for the tenth time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I had no intention of turning away from the fate placed before me or pushing it onto someone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That might have been the case until now, but not anymore.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo hesitated. Then he stared at me blankly for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, Hyeong-woo obediently followed along too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so, the inside of the gate we cautiously entered was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What is this place…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything was white and transparent. The ceiling, walls, and floor couldn’t be seen. We could only guess there was a flat floor since we were standing on something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this the gate’s concept?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite entering with great tension, it didn’t seem like there were any other life forms here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anticlimactically, in front of us was placed the easiest boss monster in the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sphere with no aggression and no life. A boss that gates just place there for courtesy, for formality’s sake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was engulfed in great doubt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s just a place with a sphere, so why did the Hyeong-woo from a different timeline…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Hyeon. What should I do with you.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Had that Hyeong-woo also entered and exited this place? If so, why did he end up calling Cheon Gang-hyeon’s name there of all places?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could it be because things have changed from the original work now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If so, then originally there should have been ‘something else’ here instead of a sphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, I felt I should confess the truth to Hyeong-woo here and now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, it was almost a certainty. I had to do it. All the air remaining in this place seemed to be pushing me to do so.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I moved a few steps. I made Hyeong-woo, who was trying to follow closely like he was tied by a rope, stop in place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Standing where I could see both the sphere and Hyeong-woo at a glance, I forced open my reluctant mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Listen carefully. I’m not Cheon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if I had come a long way around a distant path, the burden that had accumulated in my heart fell with a thud. I felt both relief and fear simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the first time, really the first time, I was saying this out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m… a possessor. I’m not the real Cheon Gang-hyeon. I’m a different person who possessed this body.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Hyeong-woo asked what I meant, I would drag out everything I knew to convince him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if Hyeong-woo really believed it, and thus learned that the real Cheon Gang-hyeon had died… the emotion he would feel was truly frightening too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo stared at me for a long time, as if facing a stranger for the first time. I endured that gaze with a miserable heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hyeong-woo’s mouth opened faster than I expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “By possession, you mean a different soul taking over a body, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s right, but…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo seemed to be taking it seriously. But far from becoming agitated, he was only very calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I see.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He only let out words in such a composed tone that it left me bewildered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You were thinking that way… so that’s why.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He nodded with eyes that showed understanding. I couldn’t follow his thoughts at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow the positions seemed reversed. I glared at Hyeong-woo, feeling like I was being left out alone. I waited for Hyeong-woo to explain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s something I haven’t told you. We agreed to be honest about everything, so I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unexpectedly, Hyeong-woo suddenly apologized. Then he started what seemed like a long story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But it would be strange to suddenly say it. I thought the time would come. I think that time is now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere flowed like water, and I couldn’t catch the timing to interrupt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When we met as children, you know the relatives’ house where I ended up staying after separating from my mother. You kept saying you wanted to keep coming to play, but I said I couldn’t get permission and absolutely wouldn’t let you come.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I clearly said I wasn’t the Cheon Gang-hyeon he knew. Why is he bringing up old stories?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to feel frustrated, thinking he couldn’t believe me after all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regardless of what I was doing, Hyeong-woo looked straight into my eyes and continued speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because that place wasn’t somewhere for kids to play. Actually… it was a shaman’s house.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the last words, I forgot whatever I had been thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since then, living there and being exposed to those things, my eyes opened a little too. …I’ll say this as a premise. From what I can see, you are Cheon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo approached me with one large stride in front of me, who was frozen and couldn’t move. His large hands grasped and wrapped around my cold hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because your soul is the same as when you were young and now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The conversation that followed, though I was speaking with my mouth, I couldn’t hear with my ears. My ears were buzzing too much. I couldn’t think of anything and felt like my head would explode.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I probably argued, asking if that meant he was a shaman too. I picked fights, being sarcastic and saying it was nonsense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t hear my own voice at all, but strangely, Hyeong-woo’s voice penetrated my blocked eardrums and clearly struck my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How do you think I saw those ghosts earlier? I’m not you, and I wasn’t looking through a familiar’s sight either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the calm explanation, my thoughts suddenly came back a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t realized it because the situation was urgent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, we had encountered various spirit monsters before. Notably, water ghosts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, Hyeong-woo said he couldn’t see them because he didn’t have a familiar, but healers didn’t need to see them anyway, so just proceed with the strategy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …That meant those were lies he made up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I did think it was strange how he supported well even without seeing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason he didn’t bother to mention it then was, as he said, due to his habit of not wanting to let others know he was different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I also recognized that Beom I-ryeong was heterogeneous. The fact that the mouse familiar had a personality, I thought was because of my background too. Even if I kept it secret, it was revealed in my skill and item names, but fortunately no one suspected anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The willow branch that was said to chase away ghosts. The sacred tree where gods dwell. The rice wine that repels ghosts. The talismans he threw from his fingertips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were all related to shaman’s ritual implements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, Hyeong-woo was looking at me again with an upright gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I return to your story now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head started ringing again. My heart was beating so loudly that it seemed to go up to my head and pound. I felt uncomfortable and nauseous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your personality, way of speaking, preferences, habits like the order when eating. They’re all the same. I couldn’t fail to recognize you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words Hyeong-woo said, trying to reassure me, spread through my chest like poison.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You were Cheon Gang-hyeon from beginning to end. I don’t know what or how you’re confused about… but this is the truth.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That can’t be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo can’t accept the truth, so he’s making up an elaborate lie. A lie so plausible it could even fool me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo’s expression, watching me, gradually hardened. He reached out to me as if feeling sorry and flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut up, don’t call me! What do you know to act like you know? Keep your mouth shut! Don’t tell me this or that!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I twisted my body as if having a seizure. I screamed and threw a tantrum. I couldn’t control myself either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking that Hyeong-woo was at a loss and keeping his mouth shut in distress, hatred welled up toward me, not toward Hyeong-woo. Both my mind and vision shattered into chaos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, it’s not true. I’m not Cheon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then who are you?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A stone dropped with a thud in my chest. I stopped breathing from the emptiness, then repeated the same words like a madman again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not true…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I spat out with all my strength whatever was stuck in my throat and trying to block my windpipe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to be Cheon Gang-hyeon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The echo rang a couple of times in the empty space. Suffocating silence flowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like I had made a huge verbal mistake and come to my senses too late. I hated the dizzy emotions to death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo broke the silence and called with a trembling voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You hated yourself that much…? Enough to think you didn’t want to be yourself?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
