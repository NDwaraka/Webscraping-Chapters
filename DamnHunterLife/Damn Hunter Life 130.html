<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But, Myodusa… is it waiting for our strategy meeting right now…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun asked an absurd question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like that because the Myodusa had been staring at us intently until the moment we finished preparing for battle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of scoffing, I just slightly raised the corner of my mouth. Hae Mi-jun stared at my face as if entranced.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not waiting for us. Where would those things have such manners?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how cute the cat head looks or how dignified it seems, that’s absolutely impossible. They’re just things dying to kill living humans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can see blue energy slowly rising. That thing just has disgustingly slow skill casting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, the giant serpent body visible behind its head also looked quite heavy-bottomed. Like it was trapped in some cave, the Myodusa didn’t budge from its spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, since we overcame the acid smoke with Ja Hyeong-woo’s curse skill, the situation isn’t entirely dark.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just be careful of the terrain and we can handle it. Let’s go!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted loudly once and then grinned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, a strange atmosphere flowed. It felt like the mood suddenly turned awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah shit, without realizing it. When Woo Sae-geon was right there behind me…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the silence was brief. Hae Mi-jun followed along with a bright smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho twitched his lips. Behind him, Jin Seol-woon rolled up his torn sleeve to his shoulder with a gently relaxed expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Ja Hyeong-woo… when our eyes met, I was the one who stiffened a bit instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was smiling. It was somewhat awkward, as if he was trying to copy my mouth corner. Like that smile I saw in the gate before, it made people flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While gauging the magic stone’s location with my eyes to catch the Myodusa, I casually sent a chat to Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Leader, join the attack too
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon moved smoothly without a word. Leaping nimbly like a beast to transfer to the next island and summoning his ox familiar to attack the Myodusa, he looked as terrifying as usual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But he’s not giving this and that command like before. Is it because of mental fatigue?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the leader stayed quiet without saying a word, the strategy proceeded smoothly. Thanks to training and combat experience, both the successors’ individual capabilities and their ability to coordinate attacks by exchanging signals with teammates had greatly improved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were no longer puppets who could only move after Woo Sae-geon ordered every skill use and managed their offense and defense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myodusa wasn’t a threatening enemy except for spewing smoke. Especially since its movements were slow and sluggish, it wasn’t difficult to defeat. By targeting the head instead of the snake body surrounded by hard shell, we could easily bring it down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…The strategy success notification isn’t appearing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That probably wasn’t the boss. No wonder it was easy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of the quietly standing Woo Sae-geon, Sa Ye-ho collected the magic stone from the dead Myodusa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I was more concerned with something else than the boss whose location I didn’t know. My heart kept feeling stuffy and I kept getting angry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I don’t know. Even if it’s out of context, I don’t care. I have to say it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve been waiting for just this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gestured for Ja Hyeong-woo and Hae Mi-jun not to follow, then stepped back alone and stood by myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that only I would appear in the system camera filming the strategy video, without anyone else being captured together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had blocked all reporters from us so that other successors younger than him wouldn’t make careless claims defending him regarding his controversy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, there’s one place Woo Sae-geon can’t block.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right here, the stage battle scene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked up diagonally. The direction of looking up at the sky. As far as I know, this angle faces the stage system cam directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Viewers watching the video later will make eye contact with me through the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The leader isn’t that kind of person. Saying the leader is that kind of person is insulting all of us successors who elevated that person to leader.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m just as pissed at people who left comments agreeing with the articles criticizing Woo Sae-geon as I am at those fucking bastards from whatever drug organization.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How can they throw around such irresponsible and frivolous words? Especially Korean people, to Woo Sae-geon? How dare they, to Woo Sae-geon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People criticizing Woo Sae-geon’s personality is quite satisfying. I’m probably included in that too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I don’t know about other things… I can’t stand by and watch them belittle the devotion that person showed for Korea.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of my statement just now, I might also receive criticism along with him until Woo Sae-geon’s innocence is properly revealed. I don’t care. Feel free to disparage me or brand me as an illegal defender.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a delinquent who thinks it’s better to lose everything I have rather than live unable to say what I need to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I knew it, I had been clenching my teeth and speaking passionately for a long time, so I didn’t realize.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That the boss monster’s thin pupils were directed at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In an instant, Woo Sae-geon’s eyes returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the intense energy that suddenly burst from beneath the island they were standing on, as if rewinding time, he moved his body first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon kicked Sa Ye-ho, who was next to him, mercilessly hard. Sa Ye-ho flew away with an “Ahhh” and escaped the Myodusa’s attack range, and using that recoil, Woo Sae-geon charged toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon who was far away behind them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rumble—! In the moment when the ground split and everything visible was destroyed, Gyeon Gang-hyeon could only barely perceive unfamiliar clothing wrapping around him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately after, violent impact struck him. His consciousness flickered momentarily from the shock. The ground beneath his feet collapsed deeply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the void that had become an endless cliff, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s two feet dangled helplessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, gripping a protruding rock on the cliff, was looking down at him. With his upper body fully extended toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon hanging in midair, holding his arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes met Woo Sae-geon’s as he regained consciousness. And at the same time, he felt that nothing was touching his dangling feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Goosebumps rose all over his body. It felt like hollow wind was seeping into his bones. The cold wind rushing up from below seemed to be sucking him into the endless precipice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Woo Sae-geon let go of this hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t look down.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person who had been looking straight into his eyes commanded with authority.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His knuckles dug strongly into Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s arm. He warned once before pulling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Put strength in your body. I’m going to pull you up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait, ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon couldn’t breathe properly and gasped. The trembling vibration was transmitted to Woo Sae-geon through the thin arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I won’t drop you. Even if you fall, I’ll follow. If I fall with you, there will be a way to survive down there too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not it, that arm. Ah, ugh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon couldn’t put strength in his arm or relax it, not knowing what to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking again, the connection between Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s arm and shoulder that he was holding was somewhat unnatural.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it dislocated?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon clicked his tongue softly. If he had pulled him up suddenly without warning, a terrible situation could have resulted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Gang-hyeon!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, noisy communication could be heard. Voices searching for them. No, they might actually only be looking for one person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hey, crazy. You’re going to jump down? Sae-geon hyung is with him, right? I saw it.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“If both of you fell…?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I looked around once but they’re not here. I think we need to ride the dragon down there. Meanwhile, please find the Myodusa and keep it in check.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon gritted his teeth and gasped repeatedly. He should tell them he’s here, but the gravity pressing down on his whole body was too painful for his mouth to open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They don’t need to come. I’m with you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s ears, Woo Sae-geon’s steady voice settled instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Grab my arm with your other hand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Following Woo Sae-geon’s calm voice, Gyeon Gang-hyeon slowly raised his other arm that had been hanging limply. Swallowing the groan that was trying to escape, he desperately grabbed Woo Sae-geon’s arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After instructing him to hold his breath, Woo Sae-geon pulled him up sharply. While hanging from the cliff with one arm himself, he succeeded in getting Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body onto one shoulder with just one pulling motion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hang on directly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Muscles rippled like waves from arm to shoulder to back. Woo Sae-geon’s freed arms climbed up the cliff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to being positioned at a right angle on those shoulders, Gyeon Gang-hyeon had to unwillingly feel all of that muscle movement directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But more uncomfortable than that was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is this person muttering such things?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon. If it had been the other way around and you were holding someone else, would you have been afraid of the cliff then too? …At that time, you would have said the same thing as me. ‘Even if we fall together, I’ll somehow manage it.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In front of the other successors, and furthermore in this stage situation that gets recorded, where ultimately all the citizens will hear…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon barely retorted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I am a show-off.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other person didn’t respond. Both were just saying what they wanted to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after climbing the cliff completely, Gyeon Gang-hyeon continued to be carried by Woo Sae-geon. Until Ja Hyeong-woo blocked their path.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo approached by stepping on stones shattered and floating in the air. He carefully took Gyeon Gang-hyeon from Woo Sae-geon’s shoulder.
 </span>
