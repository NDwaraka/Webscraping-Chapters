 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whizz! Agni, hit by my arrow, checked his reddened HP bar and fired his gun frantically at the front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo half-turned his back to tank the bullets pouring down on me while healing himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  P2 Ja Hyeong-woo: HP 92%

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s HP bar dropped to 90, then fluctuated slightly up and down from the point healing kicked in. But it ultimately maintained the 90s easily. He blocked Agni’s attacks!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The crazy bastard using a healer as a meat shield is me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much this makes sense in terms of build and personality… there’s such a thing as roles. Besides, I should be registered as a tanker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To move me easily, Ja Hyeong-woo’s grip held my side. Due to the occasional force applied, each of Ja Hyeong-woo’s knuckles pressed deep into my waist. Won’t this leave handprints later?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Sigh… Right, I’m the one going crazy and embarrassing myself alone. This bastard isn’t thinking anything.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I pulled my right arm back to shoot the bow, my elbow pressed firmly against his abs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hard and hot. It felt really strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gritted my teeth to aim.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, having something stuck to my back interfered with arrow sniping. I wonder if the people watching the match will realize that my current attacks are possible because I abandoned all other weapons and practiced only archery, becoming quite an excellent archer now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk! When arrows kept sticking into his side, Agni finally retreated. He seemed to abandon solo action and immediately move to help with the tanker fight. When the enemy we’d been facing disappeared, mine and Ja Hyeong-woo’s field of vision expanded to the melee surrounding us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this round, I didn’t die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of that, I could vividly experience as actual reality rather than through a screen the clang-clang of swords clashing, the thud-thud of shields and bodies tougher than shields colliding, the whoosh of tree branches and throwing daggers crossing between them, and gunshots ringing at regular intervals.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The five-on-five close combat continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kills didn’t come as easily as before. It was a stalemate.
 </span>
</p>

  Snake Successor: Those bastards are going into defensive mode

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You win by killing all opponents, but victory doesn’t have to come that way. It’s a game where you can win just by having more survivors on our side when the ending whistle blows if you stay in a stalemate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First Call lost the previous 1st set but grasped our patterns in return, approaching the 2nd set defensively.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huff…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After deflecting Clyte’s sword several times with her own, the slightly tired Ma Cheon-ah looked around to change the flow of battle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thus she spotted the enemy team’s healer Bootsman across the field, who had been replenishing Clyte’s health.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, when she tried to turn her gaze that way, Clyte swished her long hair and clang—! crossed swords.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That wasn’t the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni’s bullets headed toward Ma Cheon-ah. As if to prevent her from targeting the healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I was tracking Agni with suppressive fire, his movements were fast and not easy to hit. There was also the difference in weapons. Guns could fire continuously while arrows were slow one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni was poking around everywhere like that. But appropriately timing it to benefit his team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They must be chatting some too. That level of teamplay wouldn’t come without any communication.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buster would pretend to retreat when overpowered by Woo Sae-geon’s attacks, then move to strike other members of our team and cause disruption. His enormously large and heavy shield attacked Ma Cheon-ah several times, and even charged at me and Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No one from First Call came out alone and isolated. At least two always stuck together, and they protected each other when attacked. They even coordinated attacks when necessary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But well, are they the only ones gauging the enemy team’s skills?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We hadn’t even used attribute skills in the 1st set.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Urgh…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Woo Sae-geon gripped his shoulder and rotated out of sight, Buster only let out groans full of frustration. Other than that, he couldn’t respond to his nape being scraped repeatedly by twin swords.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I realized anew that Woo Sae-geon possessed speed rivaling Sa Ye-ho’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he had innate sense, Woo Sae-geon quickly grasped that his left-handed opponent was weak against attacks coming from the right. While overwhelming every opponent he met, his expression lacked passion, appearing indifferent and bored at a glance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That would surely touch Buster’s pride.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Quiche」!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buster shouted loudly. He was trying to get the mage’s support. To form a temporary pair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiche turned around, when suddenly his long golden hair flipped back in an abrupt wind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Darn~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tree branch that had just grown from Quiche’s hand reflexively protected his vital points. Because of this, Sa Ye-ho, who passed by Quiche without gain, made a disappointed sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho didn’t stop there and kept circling between Buster and Quiche. He separated their distance so they couldn’t reattach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When dodging hidden weapons flying unpredictably from all directions, even the composed Quiche would inevitably become confused.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, our side had its shortcomings too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was probably Ma Cheon-ah, who was youngest and short-sighted. When Ma Cheon-ah’s blood dropped dramatically from taking a fire attribute bullet in Agni’s surprise attack, her panicked posture crumbled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The angry Ma Cheon-ah also spewed intense flames from her sword tip.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, it probably wasn’t simply from anger. Taking out attribute skills here meant unconsciously recognizing that pure martial arts alone like in the 1st set wouldn’t work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte tightened her lips as if suffocated by the heat. Of course, it was an intentional action.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Ma Cheon-ah saw the chat, she distanced herself from Clyte.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte’s eyes widened. There had been no preliminary movement, yet Ma Cheon-ah dodged the skill as if she knew in advance—naturally so. Her face showed bewilderment for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even from afar, I could see Ma Cheon-ah’s face twist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I left all my actions to Ja Hyeong-woo and used all my energy to perform the role of skill radar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By individually defeating isolated opponents, we steadily pulled the flow of the 2nd set to our side as well. As a result.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We won the 2nd set too. Currently 2:0.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit, I shouldn’t have made that bet with Dog…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah was already drinking her kimchi soup by the bowl. She seemed to deeply regret betting on a 4:2 score due to my instigation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Riding this momentum, she seemed to believe we’d really achieve victory without giving First Call a single point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But when this happens, something always goes wrong in the next set.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sure enough, my ominous premonition hit the mark perfectly. The American team wouldn’t just quietly give up more points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as the 3rd set started, all five First Call members gathered in one place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They began pouring all attacks on one person. As if predetermined.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I knew the first target wasn’t me because of Woo Sae-geon’s rare shout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was Sa Ye-ho trusting his speed and attempting to penetrate where First Call had gathered. His ankle, trying to jump high, got caught once. By Quiche’s seemingly living, withered tree branch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Argh…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He rolled on the ground. There was no time for Woo Sae-geon to rush in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiche’s attacks, heated up by Sa Ye-ho’s harassment play, followed relentlessly. Tree branches grew wildly and tangled over Sa Ye-ho’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Above that descended the shadows of multiple tankers and dealers.
 </span>

  Instead of taking time to chat, think about survival. Does he think it’s already over? Amazing that he didn’t say it out loud since it’s a broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had relatively low stats except for attribute affinity and mobility. You could call him squishy. His HP gauge would be the second lowest after mine (though there’s about a &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; level difference between me and Sa Ye-ho).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With Sa Ye-ho eliminated and our numbers smaller than the enemy side for the first time, a sense of crisis loomed imminent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should we group up too?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But damn it, Ma Cheon-ah finally exploded. The true hot-head among successors would be Ma Cheon-ah, not Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s lid blew off seeing Sa Ye-ho get ganged up on, and she unleashed the strongest fire among fire attribute skills usable in matches.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, perhaps due to impatience, Ma Cheon-ah’s charge only resulted in our team being reduced to just three members at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The next targets are me and the healer.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Scanning all that flow faster than thinking about it, I did something that seemed like repeating the foolishness of the 1st set. I struggled to escape from Ja Hyeong-woo’s embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s sharp intake of breath echoed in my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I… I thought I should block in front of Ja Hyeong-woo. The reason I had such a pathetic idea was because I knew that in a game, it wasn’t entirely pathetic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could die. It was better to keep Ja Hyeong-woo the healer alive. Woo Sae-geon was still there, and if Woo Sae-geon received concentrated healing from Ja Hyeong-woo, he’d be virtually invincible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who had been pushing back part of the clustered First Call, gave an order.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo! Put all healing on yourself!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, at the same time, I knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether this was a game or not, inflexible Ja Hyeong-woo doesn’t consider such situations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That there was no way Ja Hyeong-woo would use healing on himself while my HP bar was dropping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Two successor death notifications appeared side by side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now, facing First Call with all five members intact, only one person remained from the Twelve Zodiac—Woo Sae-geon, the leader and Korea’s number one, all alone.
