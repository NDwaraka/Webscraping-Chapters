  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 31
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why the hell does this attribute ability only get under control after an accident happens?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ground tremors had finally settled. With a deeply uncomfortable feeling, I had been burying my face into Ja Hyeong-woo’s shoulder, but once the shock to my head subsided, I lifted my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been lying on his back against the ground, also raised his face at the same moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Our faces were so close I could count his individual eyelashes. Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Are you hurt?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment our eyes met, Ja Hyeong-woo bit his lips. His pupils wavered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It must be because of our terrible position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you hate it that much? I hate it too. You damn mouse.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyone could see this was the timing when I should apologize. But true to my role as Ja Hyeong-woo’s anger trigger, I replaced the apology with curses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, I got pissed off at the fact that even though I was putting my full body weight on him, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t seem heavy at all. I deliberately pressed down on his thigh with my butt with a thud before getting up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly gave up on the dirt-colored white traditional clothes and was contemplating how to clean up the dirt that had spilled all the way to the corridor outside the door when—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone was standing across the corridor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A person who looked like they’d just popped out of a historical drama.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current eldest member of the Twelve Zodiac, a figure precariously standing at the edge of the age range that Hunter School accommodated, had spotted both the pile of dirt and me. I thought I could hear the sound of him clicking his tongue in disapproval.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon picked up a long tree branch that had been carelessly placed nearby.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rustle—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Along with a heavy wave that even I could feel, the energy of the stick changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From Woo Sae-geon’s hand, the tip of the stick began sucking up the dirt. Like a vacuum cleaner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The annoying task that I had been seriously considering bringing a broom for was finished in just a few seconds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Woo Sae-geon isn’t the leader for nothing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had just turned an ordinary stick into an earth-attribute weapon on the spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He imbued it with a specific skill, used it just to clean up some dirt, then discarded it without another glance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It might have been a weapon that could be useful to someone else, but by Woo Sae-geon’s standards, it was a worthless object of no use whatsoever—something he could make dozens more of.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first leader of the successors, high-density attribute manipulation was this easy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His dress shoes walked straight toward me as if he wasn’t conscious of me standing there in a daze. He glanced briefly beyond the open training room door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The worst.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been spaced out until then, immediately sat up upon hearing his voice. But the other party had already seen Ja Hyeong-woo fallen over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s even a bastard who team-kills his teammate—and a healer at that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then his cold gaze turned toward me. His tone was bored, as if he were talking about something trivial.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “My fate of having to use even this kind of bastard for raids is the worst of all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today, Woo Sae-geon’s black irises seemed even deeper.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Woo Sae-geon suddenly gestured with his chin for me to enter the training room, the other successors came through the door one after another as if by appointment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What the hell is happening?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, who had been in another training room, was also summoned along with us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon sat alone in a chair placed in the center, crossing his legs. With him in the middle, the existing successors stood behind him in a structure where they observed me and Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, is this a mid-term evaluation for newcomers?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since they need to consider the newcomers’ positions too, that’s why they brought all the other successors?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun timidly waved his hand by his waist, but that was all. Despite having nine kids at an average age of 20.2—an age when they should be chattering away—the surroundings were as quiet as a tomb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to the atmosphere that Woo Sae-geon, perfectly dressed in a topknot and scholar’s robe, inflexibly spread around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, who was only in middle school, had completely frozen up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether the new youngest member, a girl 9 years younger than him, was stiffening into perfect posture because of him or not, Woo Sae-geon seemed to pay no attention to such things. With ice-cold eyes, he openly read through Won Ha-ri’s training records in front of the person in question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the lengthening silence, Won Ha-ri could barely breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon, Woo Sae-geon opened his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Myo Cho-hui.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri flinched as if her name had been called.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You take charge of teaching her. Your characteristics are most similar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had been supervising all the successors’ training. When necessary, he would point out flaws mercilessly. To him, fellow successors weren’t colleagues but subordinates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, no one raised objections to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They hadn’t been like this from the beginning either. When the successors first gathered, they went through lengthy conflicts, but eventually acknowledged the stability that came from placing Woo Sae-geon above them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you want to use a bow as a secondary weapon, shoot more. That’s all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri bowed deeply in gratitude. Even though Woo Sae-geon’s words weren’t particularly meant to give guidance—he had simply read the training records and shared his thoughts in front of the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next, it was time for my training records to be revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before starting, Woo Sae-geon raised his eyebrows as he confirmed me—the only other person sitting on the floor besides himself. His cold eyes were as sharp as needles being stuck in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon, my condition was recited.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Attribute manipulation is average. Physical strength is below ordinary people. Swordsmanship is hopeless. You must rely entirely on skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t respond. Woo Sae-geon didn’t demand a response either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Earth attribute is usually for tankers, but… there’s no way you could hold out. You can’t handle weapons other than long-range bows. With a body that collapses after firing one attack skill…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who had been muttering, finally defined me like this:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon, no matter how well you do, you’re nothing more than a disposable cannon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hmm, well. I agreed with that assessment. I wasn’t as regretful as Hae Mi-jun, whose face had turned pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I feel like picking a fight. Is it time to update my troublemaker achievements?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I looked at Woo Sae-geon and said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re also a tanker but don’t tank and focus on attacking instead, so why only me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I knew the reason better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s ox familiar wasn’t large enough to serve as a proper tanker, and his tremendous attribute affinity showed its true value more in offensive rather than defensive forms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t that he disliked being a devoted tanker like Jin Seol-woon, but that he simply followed greater efficiency.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threw this out there knowing all this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon stood up from his seat. Following his movement, the hem of his robe rustled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who had stridden over directly, grabbed me by the collar and lifted me up. In front of everyone, his back blocked me from their view.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hung me close enough that my face could be reflected in his jet-black pupils, engraving each word into me letter by letter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t take your position lightly. If you have no intention of fixing that mindset in the future, you might as well ask me to kill you. The successor behind you would be better than you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a familiar way of speaking. Of course it was, since I’d seen it in the original work. Woo Sae-geon’s motto and the attitude he took to turn kids into heroes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I hope you’re a bastard who understands what he’s told.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I’m fine with it, but what about the atmosphere?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The place where Woo Sae-geon is present is always like this. Except for the crazy Sa Ye-ho, no one can call him hyung or oppa and they all use extreme honorifics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Sa Ye-ho is absent alone, doing who knows what somewhere…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at the front of my jeogori that was pulled taut in Woo Sae-geon’s grip, I suddenly had an interesting thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Squeaky. Do it now!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky exuded an aura of utter exasperation with his whole body. But anyway, he moved as I instructed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Woo Sae-geon let go of my collar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fabric he had been gripping came loose smoothly, and the tied strings also slipped off slyly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the two sides of the jeogori opened, cold air immediately rushed inside against my body. Woo Sae-geon’s eyes fixed on my bare chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, seriously!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I screamed first. Won Ha-ri was startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Taking a step back and cleverly showing my appearance to everyone, I covered my chest with my palm and made a fuss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even so, you’re going to strip my clothes off? Do you strip people when scolding your juniors? What kind of person does that!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even I was impressed by my own masterful troublemaker acting!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only covering with my hands without grabbing or tying anything back up, making a commotion to draw aggro!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In an instant, Woo Sae-geon, who had become a molester, looked at me with a face as if he’d been slapped, a face with his soul drained, while my jeogori fluttered dramatically for all to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun covered his mouth with both cheeks completely red as if he had been the one doing the stripping. The other reactions were unclear, but Yang Pyo and Ma Cheon-ah, who usually got scolded by Woo Sae-geon the most, were biting their lips and quietly holding back laughter. From what I glimpsed briefly, Ja Hyeong-woo seemed to have a truly ridiculous expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Kuk.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then someone’s suppressed laughter burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hahaha, Jin Seol-woon slightly lowered his head and covered his forehead with his palm while laughing heartily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the person who seemed least likely to laugh was laughing, the atmosphere became even more bizarre. More than anything else, I was curious about Woo Sae-geon’s response. I looked up at him fervently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sorry for framing you, but actually I’m not sorry at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Woo Sae-geon, it’s been months since the gates first opened, isn’t your discipline still too harsh?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I understand that you made the current successors by grabbing clueless kids by the collar and putting them through hell, but you should loosen up a bit by now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve been reluctant to show my unsightly body to others, but for now, I don’t mind displaying it. Honestly, I think I could strip completely naked if it meant screwing over Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Woo Sae-geon was indeed a formidable opponent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thoom—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the sharp sword tip that Woo Sae-geon stabbed into the ground came an unbelievable sound, as heavy as a rock being driven down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Quiet. I haven’t finished talking.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No explanation. He seemed not to feel any need to explain. He exuded an aura that said he wouldn’t adjust to anyone’s rhythm, regardless of what anyone here thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He doesn’t even blush when people are openly laughing behind him. I have to acknowledge this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being someone with ghost-like intuition, there’s a high probability he knows I’m acting and is putting up with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He returned to sit with his short sword slung over his shoulder like a baseball bat. The blade protruding beside his head flashed—reflecting light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let’s stop fooling around now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I put my heart into the acting until the very end while retying my clothing strings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, a chat request appeared in the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Jin Seol-woon was standing back there without even making eye contact. He was as calm as if he had never laughed.
 </span>
</p>

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, this was the first time a successor had initiated a one-on-one chat with me. (Hae Mi-jun contacts me by phone.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t send a reply to Jin Seol-woon’s last message. While I was briefly distracted, Woo Sae-geon had made a major announcement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Soon, when a D-grade gate appears among the regular gates, I plan to take Won Ha-ri and Gyeon Gang-hyeon for observation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To rapidly develop successors, he puts them into practice immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t surprised since I’d seen Won Ha-ri do this with Myo Cho-hui in the original work. It was just that I had been added to it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri will be guided by Myo Cho-hui accompanying her. As for Gyeon Gang-hyeon…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The rest didn’t come out right away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon suddenly pressed his nose bridge with his thumb and index finger as if he had a stress headache.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyone can go along. Have them play rock-paper-scissors and whoever loses goes. Or pair him up if there’s a similar combat type.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few days later, news came that a suitable D-grade gate had opened, so we prepared to move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Woo Sae-geon instructed, Myo Cho-hui accompanied Won Ha-ri. The two petite girls stood close together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, my assigned supervisor hadn’t arrived yet. I didn’t even know who it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Which unfortunate successor is coming to clean up after me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I felt a presence behind me. I quickly turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …It’s you?
