<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Successor office at Hunter School where the fourth leader since Sa Ye-ho’s retirement was seated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the stages disappeared, it was quite rare for serious voices to flow from the office until late at night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……You’re saying the ‘Tiger’ succession has been damaged.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The 4th generation Successor leader, Jin Seol-woon, was lost in thought at his desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Myo Cho-hui’s retirement, all wood attribute hunters were currently forced into a rest period.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was revealed that Beom I-ryeong wasn’t actually a successor, the wood attribute that had almost become two people was reduced back to one. Even if they wanted to transfer affiliations to be active, there were no other wood attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Since Beom I-ryeong was a false successor, the next succession would likely be the Tiger again.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s what he had thought until now. That a Tiger successor would soon appear and the wood attribute’s rest period wouldn’t last very long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But through the system’s hint, it was revealed that this belief was wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong had dealt a blow to the successors even in death. The system said that because Beom I-ryeong had messed up things related to the Tiger successor, ‘Tiger’ succession might never happen again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Do you remember how unstable our combat power was when there wasn’t a single metal attribute?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon suddenly murmured quietly as if talking to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not sure.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person sitting across from him hesitated and shook his head slightly. It was Hae Mi-jun, the next leader and colleague he had been working with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, Hae Mi-jun was excluded from the combat team due to sluggish growth, so he didn’t know the successors’ situation as well as Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who reopened his sharp eyes, added.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Think about the Busan Gate. Even considering that we were inexperienced, we were definitely lacking in overall ability then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successors must always maintain balance, and their powers are all connected. This was a fact directly proven by Gyeon Gang-hyeon before stepping down from the leader position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, for overall power to have stability, and to exert greater power using each other as stepping stones, all five attributes must be activated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “In that sense…… it’s not good now. The wood attribute has been empty for too long.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a successor retires, some time is needed for a successor with the same power to emerge. It’s for the circulation of power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other wood attribute, the ‘Cat’ successor. That side had proper circulation when Myo Cho-hui retired. In other words, the order was pushed far back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If wood attribute awakening is delayed like this until a Rabbit successor appears again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the past, no one would have thought it strange even if one attribute was empty. However, the current successors were those who had already tasted their golden age under Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s generation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon thought it might seem like they were in decline now. Indeed, from his perspective as leader, not only successors but regular hunters’ growth was subtly breaking and gate rotations were becoming frequent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If a high-grade gate appeared at this rate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need to find a way to somehow restore the system so a Tiger successor can appear.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or a way to make five attributes exist without Tiger succession.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, whose brow was slightly furrowed, soon rested his chin lightly. A low murmur leaked between his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What would Gang-hyeon-ssi have done?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There had been Woo Sae-geon as leader before Gyeon Gang-hyeon, and Sa Ye-ho after, but Jin Seol-woon muttered as if he didn’t know this fact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, Hae Mi-jun sitting across from him was the same. They only thought of one person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Jin Seol-woon showed an effortless smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Active generation matters should be handled by the active generation. I’ll think about related issues gradually.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. I’ll also let you know if I think of any good methods.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few months ago. When Han Hyeong-woo and I had just started living together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We were eating breakfast and sitting together watching the news when familiar words filled the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So this is actually happening.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunter Olympics. Though it was already two years ago, the US had invited Korean successors to a different dimension for a friendly match as a test.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gathering participating countries, gathering spatial ability awakeners to create stadiums. Thus, the Hunter Olympics, officially opening after two years, was scheduled to be held this summer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Korea is also a participating country.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successors?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, regular hunters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While casually talking with Han Hyeong-woo, the faces of Ma Cheon-ah and Hae Mi-jun briefly passed through my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some of them might happily go out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the current successors’ position was that they wouldn’t step onto an international stage. Therefore, they yielded the participation rights to regular hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When even the current active members are avoiding it, what would retirees like me and Ja Hyeong-woo do?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just need to watch as a spectator.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I had set aside the Olympics matter……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As time passed, on a day in early summer, I received this invitation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  「We would like to invite those five from that time to the opening ceremony. You don’t need to watch the subsequent competitions, so please attend the opening ceremony and grace us with your presence.」
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The World Hunter Association invited the five successors from the past friendly match as VIPs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why us?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems like it would be bothersome if we go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not like international relations would become strange if we refuse this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Didn’t they also invite us just for courtesy? So we can just refuse, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I was overlooking something at this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that there was one guy who would show boundless interest and curiosity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Let’s go! Let’s go let’s go let’s go let’s go—.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho machine-gunned my eardrums through the phone. I covered my ears with my fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go ask Yoon Sae-geon to go!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Sae-geon hyung said he won’t go. Won’t you go with me? Won’t you? Won’t you?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, go pester Yoon Sae-geon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even for me, there are lines I can’t cross. Sae-geon hyung has his reverse scale too.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His lively voice suddenly became gloomy. I flinched for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Damn guy, using a sympathy operation.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know what circumstances there are, but GO Ye-ho was always like that. He seems to come and go in Yoon Sae-geon’s life well, but then sometimes he’s cautious like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I told him to go with Ma Cheon-ah, she said she couldn’t come because she had to go on an overseas gate expedition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I thought she’d come, but has she matured?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually, the only person GO Ye-ho could go with was me……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, I changed my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeong-woo, want to go to the opening ceremony? I feel like going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I changed my mind in just 20 minutes, Han Hyeong-woo obediently nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But…… are you going because Ye-ho asked you to?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Take back what I said about obedient.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No? I want to try getting a suit fitted.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I spoke honestly, Han Hyeong-woo’s eyes became gentle again. Simple guy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was a bit dangerous for the two of us to go to a crowded department store together, we found a custom tailor shop with Manager Park Yoon-seok’s help.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo followed because I was going. He looked happy until I tried on all kinds of suits, but when I said let’s measure your size, his energy suddenly dropped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t like it because it’s uncomfortable.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I whispered quietly in the ear of the guy throwing an unreasonable tantrum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you get a suit fitted, we’ll be wearing couple outfits there?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he immediately went to the side and pointed to the most ordinary black suit. Really simple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what he said to the staff right away was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Two of the same—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I covered Han Hyeong-woo’s mouth and dragged him away. Han Hyeong-woo obediently let himself be dragged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, you really want to wear the exact same thing? No way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had tried to entice him for nothing and got it thrown back at me before long. I explained several times that if we appeared wearing the exact same thing, it would be like coming out to the World Hunter Association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo didn’t insist anymore. Instead, he became subtly sulky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ended up digging my own grave again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Pick whatever you want to dress me in for mine. Okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thus, the opening ceremony outfit Han Hyeong-woo carefully chose for me became a beige suit with a design that was just barely formal-like.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wanted a darker color but couldn’t help it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, as long as Han Hyeong-woo is happy……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few days later, several suits arrived at home. As soon as I opened the box, I told Han Hyeong-woo to put one on and come out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I sat on the sofa and waited, but my mood was a bit…… strange. It reminded me of a groom-to-be or something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do I look okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo came out after a while. He asked quietly while avoiding eye contact, seemingly embarrassed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he was a bit too burly, his broad upper body and thick thighs made him look very tall and impressive. I inwardly let out an “oh……” in admiration and said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You look like a muscular bear in a suit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo was visibly disappointed. Only then did I smile and pat his shoulder with my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, your face is handsome but your shoulders and chest are too big.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I not wear it……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why wouldn’t you wear it? Wear it. I like it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly appeased Han Hyeong-woo who was alternately looking at the mirror and his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then, Gang-hyeon, you come out wearing yours too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. I’ll wear it on the day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, it was because I was already embarrassed thinking about how he’d sit on the sofa and stare at me dreamily if I came out wearing it. So let’s reduce the frequency to just once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The opening ceremony, befitting an event with the Olympics name, had many spectacles and was magnificent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just went pretending since they casually invited us…… but honestly, I stared like a country bumpkin throughout the opening ceremony.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This would also be part of Cheon Gang-hyeon. Since he was always in the hospital, he probably never saw such things directly with his own eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I looked down at the opening ceremony venue from the VIP seats, Han Hyeong-woo watched me from the seat next to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the opening ceremony, I had tied my shoulder-length hair in a half-up style, wore the bright-colored suit I bought with Han Hyeong-woo that fit perfectly, and put on brown shoes. I wore a metal watch on the inside of my wrist and lightly took care of my skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe that’s why. Han Hyeong-woo’s gaze felt burdensome.
 </span>
</p>
