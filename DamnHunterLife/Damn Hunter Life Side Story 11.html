  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 11
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho arrived a bit late to the opening ceremony, saying he suddenly had something to discuss with the video editor for his broadcast. GO Ye-ho, who entered the VIP seats with light steps, widened his eyes as soon as he saw me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whoa.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt a bit embarrassed and pushed Ja Hyeong-woo forward instead of myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How’s our boy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had deliberately stopped by a hair salon and made Ja Hyeong-woo expose half his forehead and even get his hair blow-dried. GO Ye-ho looked Ja Hyeong-woo up and down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s this? You actually made him presentable? I thought he’d come in a tracksuit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did GO Ye-ho’s eyes return to normal. GO Ye-ho ignored Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze and sat in the seat next to me on the opposite side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We planned to return after just watching the opening ceremony. After exchanging brief greetings with several Association people, while Ja Hyeong-woo and I were resting in the waiting room, GO Ye-ho went to request teleportation from the staff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right then, a young man’s voice with clumsy pronunciation burst in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing the man approaching quickly with an obviously delighted expression, I suddenly felt dazed as if I’d returned to two years ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A tall foreigner with green eyes. It was Agni. The fire-attribute gunner hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy who got entangled with me badly during the friendly match, and after I somehow learned about his family circumstances, suddenly confessed and hit me hard in the back of the head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni, who had approached in almost a single bound, lightly embraced me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire flared up in Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes as he failed to stop it in time. I broke out in a cold sweat. I struggled weakly and escaped from Agni’s embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s been a long time. You look really cool today. Did you come to watch the opening ceremony?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Does this guy still like me…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni smiled brightly. His eyes were dripping with obvious affection toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes grew increasingly cold. Still, thanks to my training him all this time, he didn’t do anything rash here where he needed to maintain his public image.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Right, I can’t just vaguely hide this and let it pass. That would be rude to both of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if this spreads to the public, since I decided to say it, I have to take responsibility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m dating him now. Don’t just hug me like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pointed to Ja Hyeong-woo and confessed honestly to Agni.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was worried about hurting his feelings. But Agni, rather than being disappointed, actually brightened up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Back then I didn’t know you could date men.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh… that’s how it turned out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And then he surprised me instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni just said “I see” without much fuss. He flashed a refreshing smile, and that was the end of it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We don’t have each other’s contact information and you’ve retired, but I guess there’s still such a thing as fate. If you ever come to travel to America, contact me! I’ll guide you around with no ulterior motives.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There wasn’t the troublesome situation I’d expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni quickly left, saying he had to go to his guild.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like we parted on good terms, but Ja Hyeong-woo thought differently than I did. As soon as we were alone, he brought his face close to mine and got heated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He thinks he has slightly more of a chance with you than before. At least since you’re seeing a man now. That’s why he’s smiling.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Isn’t that too paranoid?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt awkward and grumbled back sulkily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m also a black-hearted bastard so I know. Don’t deal with that guy ever again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright, alright.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I raised my hand and patted his head a few times, his sharp eyes immediately softened. Though his expression still looked displeased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon GO Ye-ho returned. It was fortunate that bastard didn’t see Agni.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’re teleporting within 5 minutes. Anyone who needs to use the bathroom should go now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you using teleportation like it’s an express bus?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, let’s go home. Ja Hyeong-woo also seemed to want us to be alone soon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw him trying to scrunch up his dress shoes because they were uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since we got all dressed up, want to go to a nice bar? We don’t have to watch the match but we can drink.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it wouldn’t be GO Ye-ho if he disbanded like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I narrowed my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you want to get me drunk?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now everyone knows that’s not your drunk behavior.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, 5 minutes had already passed. The three people’s bodies became translucent for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We were transported with a feeling of being sucked somewhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I blinked at the unfamiliar scenery.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Had the Korean Hunter Association already demolished their building and built a circular stadium and colosseum on the empty lot… as if.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s this? Where are we?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho frowned as he looked around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed there was an error in the teleportation destination. Though it wasn’t a completely strange place – we seemed to have arrived at one of the empty Olympic stadiums…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Wait, could the competition event be?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly my spine went cold. So this Olympics isn’t ordinary competition, is it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For example, a stadium background that reproduced a vast forest as is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the presence of other life forms we could sense besides us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gulp.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho swallowed his breath. Ja Hyeong-woo pulled me into his arms without changing expression. His eyes held a sharp glint as he glared over there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A body that looked completely burned and blackened, with unusually long arms and legs. Green saliva dripped from prominently protruding fangs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed to be a combat event stadium that used captured monsters. No wonder it felt ominous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching that, I suddenly let out a hollow laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had unconsciously tried to open my inventory. The embarrassment and emptiness I felt when I realized it were entirely mine to bear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt strange to encounter monsters after so long. Like I’d been max level, deleted my character, and returned to a newbie account.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I poked GO Ye-ho’s side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the most active one among us. Do something about it. You were even a leader? Amazing, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, I’m a civilian, aren’t I? I only became leader because someone forced me into it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho is an attention seeker among attention seekers, but he actually doesn’t like stepping up for weighty responsibilities like being the Twelve Zodiac leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is something you’d never know just from the outside. He liked giving orders in games, but that was just games after all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, then you want me to solve this? I had the shortest term in power.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you did the biggest thing! Don’t you remember when the final stage was broadcast, the whole nation was only calling your name?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, that damn edited version.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now it’s all black history. Because Ja Hyeong-woo often (no, quite frequently…) plays it at home to watch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo recently discovered the internet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He usually spent his daily internet surfing time attacking old posts that cursed me in the Twelve Zodiac community and clicking ‘like’ on posts that fangirled over me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s really like a crazy person, so these days I monitor him every time Ja Hyeong-woo turns on the computer. Such is my fate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, we cautiously backed away while being wary of the monsters. Had we moved about three or four steps away? The monsters that had been staring at us intently and gauging us suddenly started charging at us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ahhhhh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho screamed like a fragile civilian and grabbed me tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, obviously seeing I’d fall behind, suddenly lifted me up and ran while carrying me. I just obediently clung to Ja Hyeong-woo’s neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though GO Ye-ho had lost his hunter abilities, his mobility was still the strongest among us, so he quickly ran ahead of us. Though it was a breathless situation where every second counted, we three noisily kept trying to push responsibility onto others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the most energetic, go do some assassination!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me a weapon before saying that!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Damn it, someone give me a bow! This is so frustrating!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If we survive this, let’s go to an archery cafe together, Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did Ja Hyeong-woo just set a death flag?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s go without GO Ye-ho.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We passed hundreds of artificial trees. As we ran, somehow the monsters kept increasing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And we finally came face to face with one wall of the stadium.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Several staff members who had been outside the stadium discovered us and rushed over. But they weren’t awakened either, so they couldn’t immediately do anything to help. The staff members clutched their heads and stamped their feet beyond the transparent wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can’t come in here! How did you get in! Who are you people?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look here! We don’t want to be here either! Call your superiors! I’m going to file a complaint!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GO Ye-ho shouted back in fluent English.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the fate of the trio who could only run was decided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before we knew it, we were surrounded by monsters on all sides. Ja Hyeong-woo held me tightly and put his back against GO Ye-ho’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The appearance of the monsters closing the distance while dripping saliva was too realistic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But rather than being scared…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was caught up in feelings somewhat different from what one would normally feel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My palms kept tingling. Like they were itching. My hands twitched, wanting to grasp something long and curved like a staff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I really tried to forget. I was sincere when I felt relieved leaving everything behind.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But actually…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was missing it a little. The time when even I, with my hopeless body, could shoot and take down monsters, glaring fiercely at the distance until my eyes hurt, and be active as one of the combatants.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensation of my heart beating heroically, feeling vividly alive.
 </span>
</p>
