 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun didn’t leave for a while, watching me from behind a corner, and only ran off when I turned around to look at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I was alone in the hallway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides Hae Mi-jun, there probably wouldn’t be anyone else willing to show their face to a bastard like me, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That bastard Ja Hyeong-woo said he’d wait but he’s nowhere to be seen—’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump, I stomped my left foot on the ground a bit hard. I deliberately made a loud noise to cut off my thoughts midway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why am I worrying about that bastard? If he’s not here, that’s more comfortable for me.
 </span>

  Successor Training Ground—Training Ground 八
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I entered, the lights in the previously dark training ground turned on brightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it summoned two new successors, it seemed to be structured to operate only when both successors entered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, Successor Won Ha-ri was already here. Unlike me who was 1 minute late, she seemed to have timed it precisely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The girl who was about 160cm tall glanced at me once, then violently turned her head in the opposite direction. It was excessive enough to seem dramatic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I casually gave a light greeting without much meaning. Then Won Ha-ri twisted her head even more in the opposite direction, as if she’d heard something she shouldn’t have. She twisted it so much that her posture ended up looking like she was standing with her back to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I just sat on the floor at an appropriate distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, I was inadvertently softened by Won Ha-ri’s youthful appearance, similar to Hae Mi-jun. But apparently she wasn’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She was clearly treating me like I was invisible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is going to be a long road too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the midst of a truly frigid atmosphere, the status window screen turned on and an AI instructor appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Successor Gang-hyeon, and Successor Won Ha-ri. We will begin your first joint training.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window was individual, but the AI voice was heard throughout the entire training ground. It seemed to be because it was joint training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri quickly raised her hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Before we start, there are two things I’d like to address.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing the AI use honorifics to her as if she were a teacher, Won Ha-ri clearly had manners.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “In the zodiac, the monkey order comes before the dog order, so why did you call my name after Gang-hyeon’s?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow I couldn’t find those manners when it came to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And I’d prefer if you didn’t use the word ‘joint.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As sharp as befitting someone with metal attribute, she made her request, then looked me in the eye for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the two characters ‘con.tempt’ written in her pupils.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just shrugged my shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How should I try to win her over?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was time to choose the third successor to make my ally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The AI instructor guided Won Ha-ri and me according to a systematic curriculum.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wouldn’t the last one normally use a word like ‘dismissal’?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri and I seemed to be trapped here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it was the first day, there was no orientation and we mercilessly went straight into physical training. The moment I was promoted to successor status, my free will ceased to exist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In 1st period, Attribute Affinity Training, we meditate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Feel the energy inherent in your body, gradually get closer to that energy as if talking to it, and draw it up so the energy circulates throughout your entire body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is a field the original protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo is particularly good at. And it’s the field Hae Mi-jun was so bad at that I helped him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri placed her cushion at the far end of the training ground and sat there. It was a distant enough location that I couldn’t even hear her breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What do you feel when metal attribute meditates? Something cold and sharp? That doesn’t sound pleasant.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m done.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Well done.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri quickly opened her eyes and looked bright. Meanwhile, no matter how much I closed my eyes and concentrated inside my body, I couldn’t feel any energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At the gate it just worked without thinking. What’s the problem?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a while, I felt energy that was slightly warm and stuffy, like being buried in damp, fine soil.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It worked, but it’s embarrassing that someone who successfully taught Hae Mi-jun is slower than Won Ha-ri.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason Attribute Affinity Training is 1st period is as follows:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After drawing up your ability, maintain that state while continuing the subsequent training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once you get used to this, you can enter combat like other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  2nd period, Basic Physical Enhancement…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I not do this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Please don’t. And don’t become a successor either.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the inevitable way to the gym, Won Ha-ri briefly looked back at me when it seemed like I wasn’t following. But when our eyes met, she avoided me as if I were Medusa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I’m going to the regular water attribute gym I used to attend.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t ask you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course you didn’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, Won Ha-ri’s ignoring me was becoming interesting. I wondered how far it would go—should I say I wanted to provoke her more?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly the status window asked:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /You’re not planning to address the honorifics issue either?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Make her call me oppa?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window brought up age hierarchy. I paused for a moment, then gave a nonchalant response.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Never mind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you’ve read the original, you’d naturally know Won Ha-ri’s circumstances too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It would be hard for her to call me by that title.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can roughly guess. Looking into Won Ha-ri’s inner thoughts for overreacting to me, there’s a not-so-simple thought process hidden there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I headed to the regular gym. Won Ha-ri would be welcomed by senior successors at the successor gym, but I wouldn’t be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it wasn’t just for that reason—I still had a reason to go to the regular gym.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The middle school kids there only came when I was there.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was worried those bully bastards would cause trouble again when I wasn’t there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I see those thuggish bastards acting up, I’m planning to mess with them too. Something like ‘publicizing bullying within Hunter School.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Hae Mi-jun debuted, bullying of hunters in his group probably almost disappeared, but just in case.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha-ri, how’s training? Is it okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, unni.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was the first day, Won Ha-ri seemed to be looked after by fellow women Myo Cho-hui and Ma Cheon-ah from time to time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, no one comes to see me. They pretend not to notice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They’re probably waiting to see more.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After finishing lunch, training had moved on to 3rd period martial arts. I was late again because I took an hour nap after lunch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri looked at me once like I was human scum, then picked up a thin sword that was placed in the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this the sword I’ll be borrowing today?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [That’s correct.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you can’t make weapons of your own attribute yet and don’t have a senior of the same attribute, you can use weapons of attributes that have a generative relationship in the five elements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For metal attribute, that would be earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The sword is too light.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, true to her metal attribute directly connected to ‘strength’ stats, was incredibly strong. Since she probably hasn’t adapted to superhuman strength yet, she must be breaking everything around her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Won Ha-ri grabbed my arm wrong, it would snap cleanly, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time our gazes crossed even briefly, Won Ha-ri’s eyes became sharp. I glanced at her small hands swinging the sword at invisible speed—whoosh, whoosh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I shouldn’t get too carried away.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As training gradually ripened, Won Ha-ri moved beyond the stage of treating me like I didn’t exist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, stinging gazes like bee stings kept poking at my side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can feel the wariness. I can feel the wary gaze.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her thoughts were obvious. She probably wanted to do better than the alcoholic delinquent, the bastard who played around until now and just awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve materialized one skill too! Please watch me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Please try it in the next room.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She probably saw me in the gate video, look at her declaring so loudly that she has a skill too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Very much like a kid that age.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Successor Won Ha-ri reveals aspirations… “My parents were worried but eventually supported me, I’ll work hard not to burden my seniors.”&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At such a young age becoming a successor, the pressure must be great. She’s probably all tense, considering me as the rival to surpass first in the long training life ahead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huk, huk…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [You’ve only done two laps.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Lower it a bit…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [That’s already been lowered four times.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My stamina and image are both too trashy to be worth considering as competition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even I could see Won Ha-ri gradually losing her fighting spirit. Now she was openly staring at me and getting more and more bewildered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That weak?’, ‘Can’t lift that?’, ‘Collapsing there?’ …that was all me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  […Take a 10-minute break.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the AI just now seemed at a loss for words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was lying on the floor gasping when the training ground door opened and someone entered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He stopped in front of me and looked down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Jin Seol-woon. Dressed in a white shirt and black pants, his face looked particularly distant, probably because of his long legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was fanning myself because my face was too flushed with heat, a different color flickered in his eyes as he stared intently at my face.
 </span>
