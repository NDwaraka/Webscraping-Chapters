  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 9
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What happened immediately after was like a nature documentary of herbivores fleeing from carnivores.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he had run properly, he would have been caught ten times over. However, Han Hyeong-woo deliberately walked slowly with a smile on his lips, letting Cheon Gang-hyeon go. He pursued him tensely from a distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you keep hiding like that, it turns me on more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon hid in the wardrobe, trembling at the low voice coming from outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, he knew this kind of atmosphere would develop from the moment he got undressed. …He did sneakily follow along knowing that. But still.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m seriously pissed because I’m genuinely scared!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the wardrobe door burst open. Light poured over the naked body of Cheon Gang-hyeon, who was crouched with his knees up. And a large shadow fell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyaak! Hey, at least the location, the location! Hyuk…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tremendous hands pulled Cheon Gang-hyeon’s body and laid him sprawling inside the large wardrobe. When his lower half hung outside the wardrobe, only his lower body dropped down. Cheon Gang-hyeon was horrified and supported his body by pressing his arms against the wardrobe floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clothes rustled above Cheon Gang-hyeon’s head. Han Hyeong-woo pressed Cheon Gang-hyeon’s buttocks against his abdomen and held up his two legs flailing in the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon had no choice but to wrap his calves around Han Hyeong-woo’s waist to survive, like swallowing mustard while crying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clang, clang, the wardrobe shook violently. The smooth calves and thighs protruding from the wardrobe bounced wildly under the influence of the thrusting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The white buttocks mounted on top were turning red from stimulation while Han Hyeong-woo’s cock was inserted. Each time flesh collided, wet slapping sounds and water sounds echoed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His body, more than half floating, struggled more violently than usual. He was so tense he was almost convulsing, afraid of falling. The inner walls contracted as if squeezed from fear and tension.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Separate from being scared, whether he was feeling more, Cheon Gang-hyeon’s cock pressed against his belly was twitching diligently by itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How long had they been like that? White liquid shot out with a swoosh from Cheon Gang-hyeon’s erect cock. It dirtied Han Hyeong-woo’s chest and dripped onto the clothes hanging in the wardrobe, leaving white stains.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You clean it all up…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Han Hyeong-woo pulled him out of the wardrobe as he drooped from exhaustion, these were the words Cheon Gang-hyeon barely muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words Cheon Gang-hyeon said most to Han Hyeong-woo were “Are you hungry?” or “What do you want to eat?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo similarly valued meals, but the feeling was a little different from what Cheon Gang-hyeon said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words he said most were “Eat and sleep.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo never woke the sleeping Cheon Gang-hyeon. Except for mealtimes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When looking around the house for Gang-hyeon during the day, he would sometimes find him curled up asleep on the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had probably just gotten sleepy while folding laundry and fallen asleep, but seeing him sleep after even toppling the tower of towels made Han Hyeong-woo feel strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t describe it specifically, but if he had to say, it was close to feeling upset.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He silently carried Cheon Gang-hyeon and moved him to the wide bed. Then he lay beside him and gazed endlessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon spent much more time sleeping than the average adult’s sleep time. Even though his awakening had cured all his illness, his naturally weak body hadn’t completely changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today when he opened his eyes, Gang-hyeon had caught a cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The cause was yesterday when Han Hyeong-woo was watering the field in the garden and accidentally soaked Cheon Gang-hyeon’s front completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally, Cheon Gang-hyeon didn’t stay still, and a water fight broke out. They aimed at each other with hoses, using chairs as cover. Water streams flew everywhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It reminded them of childhood and they couldn’t stop. Han Hyeong-woo grinned broadly as he splashed water buckets. They didn’t stop until they had soaked each other from head to toe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then they kissed outside for a long time without even changing their wet clothes, and though he felt nothing, his body must have been cold because he fell ill the next day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was different from sexual pain. The sight of Cheon Gang-hyeon groaning while wrapped tightly in blankets broke Han Hyeong-woo’s heart. He regretted that his healing ability had disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t regret quitting being a hunter, but he was painfully regretful that he couldn’t help Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon lying in bed had a flushed face from fever. Han Hyeong-woo fed him breakfast, gave him fever reducer, and stayed by his side all morning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll catch my cold.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Han Hyeong-woo kissed right next to his lips, Cheon Gang-hyeon was startled. When their eyes met, Han Hyeong-woo played innocent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to try catching something called a cold too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really unlucky.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he cursed, it wasn’t because he was genuinely angry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Past 3 PM, the fever had mostly gone down. But he still had no strength and was coughing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, today was even cloudy. The house was dim even during the day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Cheon Gang-hyeon, while coughing, brought the remote to Han Hyeong-woo and said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, it’s cloudy too, let’s watch a thriller movie.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were about to sit side by side on the sofa when suddenly Han Hyeong-woo suggested a strange position. He first lay down on the sofa, then gestured at his body with his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to use his burly body as a heated bed and his large chest as a pillow. Though Cheon Gang-hyeon was displeased, he climbed on top. He lay prone on top of Han Hyeong-woo, their bodies overlapping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as he rested his temple on the chest, Cheon Gang-hyeon frowned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is your heart okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo’s heart was beating too fast. It was pounding inside, almost seeming like it would break through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s always like that. It’s fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That doesn’t make sense. You’re a guy whose heart rate is slow like an athlete’s.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon grumbled and settled again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The movie was about a serial killer. Han Hyeong-woo often looked down at the crown of Cheon Gang-hyeon’s head as he watched intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was funny was when Gang-hyeon was about to cough, at that moment the killer’s hideous face popped out, making him cough tremendously. Han Hyeong-woo barely turned his head to hide his laughter and handed him a water cup.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then for a while the killer didn’t appear, and it became a section where the story progressed calmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo only slightly raised his head at the wheezing breathing sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprisingly, Gang-hyeon had fallen fast asleep on top of his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He paused the movie. In the quiet house, only the sound of drizzling rain could be heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His heart felt so warm it seemed like it would overflow. He listened to Gang-hyeon’s breathing and fell into various thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his awakening, Cheon Gang-hyeon’s body had completely shaken off illness. Even so, just in case, he went for regular checkups.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I come with you too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the day Cheon Gang-hyeon visited the hospital, Han Hyeong-woo had asked carefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon nodded without any particular change in expression. How proud and grateful he was for the permission.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Continuing such thoughts, he also remembered going to his parents’ memorial hall with Gang-hyeon before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The aunt and uncle, who only now learned the news, were smiling in the photos. Han Hyeong-woo bowed deeply in greeting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m an unfilial son.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If there’s such a thing as the responsibility of those who remain, it would surely be remembering and missing those who have departed. However, his current self doesn’t even feel that these people are his parents, he confessed calmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo stood facing him and comforted him with emotion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You made the best choice then. Die, or live having lost your memory. Aunt and uncle would naturally want the latter. And look at how much you’ve accomplished since then. You overcame all the difficult moments, became called a hero by people. Your illness is all cured too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To the blank face, Han Hyeong-woo added his final words with emotion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…And you came back to me, who remembers them both.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eye contact stretched long and long, holding silence. Han Hyeong-woo reached out his arms to embrace him right there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Cheon Gang-hyeon avoided him in embarrassment. In a voice as small as a mosquito’s, he asked what he was doing in front of mom and dad.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I think you consider them quite sufficiently as your parents.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had returned to reality, caressed the clearly exposed nape. It was hair cut a few days after leaving school, when they went to the salon together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The same hand soon lightly touched Cheon Gang-hyeon’s soft hair that had just started growing again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon had made excuses saying he suddenly didn’t want to cut his hair anymore, but it seemed like he actually wasn’t cutting it because Han Hyeong-woo liked his long hair more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo was so pleased with this fact that even though he was tone-deaf, he hummed songs every day. Excited, he always held a hair dryer to dry Gang-hyeon’s hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo’s eyes, which had been softly relaxed, gradually sank. When spending quiet time like this, he kept thinking of the times previous Cheon Gang-hyeon must have endured alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The days when Cheon Gang-hyeon suffered when he wasn’t watching. The scene of him vomiting blood and crying in front of him. How he admirably called him after waking up crying at night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo quietly looked down at Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current him had none of the childhood memories that Han Hyeong-woo sometimes talked about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, Han Hyeong-woo wasn’t sad at all. He felt a little sorry, but that was simply because of the bewilderment Gang-hyeon would feel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This might sound sorry to you… but I don’t feel lacking. I remember, and you listen. Far from lacking, it’s more than enough.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He slowly closed and opened his eyes, kissed Cheon Gang-hyeon’s crown and whispered softly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeon-ah. Let’s live well together.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon didn’t answer because he was sleeping, but his gentle breathing was incredibly stable. He had stopped coughing at some point too.
 </span>
</p>
