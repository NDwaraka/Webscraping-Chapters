  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 104
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even with all his teammates except himself dead, Woo Sae-geon showed no emotion as he struck Buster’s shield with his sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite Woo Sae-geon’s weapon being a thin blade, a heavy explosive sound spread as if he were smashing with a greatsword. Buster’s shield rang out *clang clang*.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The force was overwhelming enough to dominate even us watching through the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, seeing Woo Sae-geon remain so composed as if he had been fighting alone from the beginning, one suspicion arose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It doesn’t mean we were that useless… right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni fired bullets from behind Buster. Woo Sae-geon didn’t even dodge them. The bullets hit his temple directly, but the bullets just *thud* fell after their rotation stopped, leaving his health bar almost unchanged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps frustrated, Agni attempted provocation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can a captain who survived alone really be considered competent?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Rumble*—! An earth tremor as if heaven and earth were enraged made the open field shudder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had brought out his earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni’s body trembled slightly. Not just that childish gunner, but all of First Call’s members.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The screen captured each other from their respective viewpoints. From First Call’s perspective… Woo Sae-geon standing detached looked exactly like a monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Conversely, from Woo Sae-geon’s viewpoint, the clustered First Call looked like a ragtag bunch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bootsman, First Call’s captain, slightly narrowed his eyes. He was probably telling his teammates through chat right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Attack all at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unless they used a formation where the tanker pushed from the front while dealers swarmed the target, it was obvious they couldn’t match Woo Sae-geon in strength, speed, or even composure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With rough movements, Woo Sae-geon’s hat string snapped *ping* and iridescent beads scattered wildly. Spinning his body to deflect multiple attacks in one strike, Woo Sae-geon harshly kicked away Buster’s shield. He *snap snap* cut through the tree branches tangling around his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Which side should be called more tenacious?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First Call persistently pushing with five against one? Or Woo Sae-geon steadily managing his strength while wielding his sword like a storm?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Woo Sae-geon had also lost a lot of health. He couldn’t hide it outwardly in the end. His slightly loosened topknot was soaked with sweat, and his red ornament string had come undone and tangled in his clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, he tightened First Call’s breathing as if he wasn’t tired.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unable to withstand Woo Sae-geon’s force, Clyte dropped her sword. Woo Sae-geon kicked Clyte and slammed her into Quiche. The slender Quiche tumbled along with her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when he got up, Clyte was already dead and gone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon threw one sword upward, then with his bare hands grabbed the collar of Agni who happened to be charging in and slammed him straight into the ground. Agni disappeared immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those two had just been eliminated by internal injuries from Woo Sae-geon’s brute force. Even I watching couldn’t close my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, Buster charged in forcefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s eyes crumpled for the first time as if being crushed. The impact was so severe that his firmly planted foot left drag marks on the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buster timed his reach to when Woo Sae-geon’s sword was falling and intercepted the sword. But then came Bootsman’s scream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let go of the sword!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Boom!* An explosion from the earth attribute skill erupted from the sword. The roar penetrated the entire area.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before anyone knew it, Woo Sae-geon had leaped over Buster and was behind him. He faced healer Bootsman one-on-one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiche hurriedly pulled Bootsman toward where he was, but while he could avoid the immediate blade, the result was gathering two people in one place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Two more from First Call died. Buster aimed for Woo Sae-geon’s back for a final attack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both their health bars were hanging at the very edge. In this critical moment, I tensed up completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From beginning to end, Woo Sae-geon never closed his eyes deep in their sockets, watching Buster’s movements as he swung his sword widely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Beep*—! The match end sound shook my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment the spectator screen shook very violently, making immediate identification difficult, and the result of that clash could only be confirmed through notifications.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, I didn’t expect it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Buster ▷ Woo Sae-geon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because the screen quickly darkened after the match ended, we could all only see the sword fallen on the ground and the hand lying beside it for a very brief moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Day 1 Match Score]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Successors 2:1 First Call]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sun of this space set, and a fake moon rose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A figure dressed as a scholar wore the night sky on his hat and walked along the wall, dragging shadows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under his chin, a string woven with crystal beads faintly rippled in the moonlight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had come to the main building for an interim meeting, met Bootsman, the opposing team’s captain he had crossed swords with earlier, and was on his way back to the dormitory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Bootsman saw Woo Sae-geon, he stood up and requested a handshake. Then he had said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know what to say… I know it’s presumptuous, but your strength inspires respect in us. Thank you for the good match.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The match organizers asked if they could restrict all of Woo Sae-geon’s earth attribute skills from Set 4 onward for balance. That was exactly why they had called Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, crimson hair announced its presence against the moonlight in Woo Sae-geon’s field of vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon stopped walking. He looked up at Sa Ye-ho on the wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The snake whose eyes met his bared his neat teeth in a grin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Has your anger cooled down now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon passed by without opening his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then a soundless presence fell from above to below, walking beside Woo Sae-geon with the same stride.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung also gets angry over games and stuff… Aren’t you tired?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Woo Sae-geon didn’t give any particular response, Sa Ye-ho muttered away as always.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Those kids at most… completely banning hyung’s skills. That’s about what they managed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Always accurately guessing even what he didn’t say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything about Sa Ye-ho was fickle, but right now his tone wasn’t bouncing around. Like tonight’s subdued hanbok pattern.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The winning bastards have a lot of demands too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon spoke sarcastically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Set 3 was hyung’s win.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence flowed after Sa Ye-ho’s words. For once, Sa Ye-ho wasn’t looking for other things to chatter about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as they reached Woo Sae-geon’s dormitory, Sa Ye-ho’s eyes sparkled and changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What does hyung’s room look like?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the guest rooms would be the same. Even thinking that, Woo Sae-geon didn’t say it out loud. Sa Ye-ho probably wasn’t asking out of genuine curiosity either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dormitory provided by the American side for us Successors was quite nice. It was a traditional Korean house, and they gave all the Successors private rooms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lying on the bed, holding and petting the warm Mung-mung against my side, I fell into thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No matter how we’re one point ahead…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ending the day with defeat isn’t good for morale. That will definitely carry over to tomorrow’s first match.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Flow is never something you can ignore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Woo Sae-geon, despite maintaining the same expressionless face throughout, couldn’t be said to be quite the same as usual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how this is just a game where we don’t even bring out intermediate or higher skills…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not great to show Korea’s #1 getting killed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps that’s why. Sa Ye-ho also seriously offered his opinion to prevent the team from falling into a sense of defeat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually, we could have done that from the start too. Like team-based shooting games, five people clustering together to pick off opponents one by one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I thought the Americans would bring this out starting from Set 4’s territory battle… Because they think of this as a show.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If spectators watching territory battles expect strategy and teamplay from players, death games are a match format for seeing individual participants’ quick reflexes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If victory is achieved through other methods, unless it’s particularly exhilarating or thrilling, spectators are bound to get bored.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First Call would have known this best of all. Yet they brought out the uninteresting method of swarming to pick off opponents one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It made sense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They got desperate after losing two rounds.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in that final moment, Woo Sae-geon really lost by a hair’s breadth. Because it seemed impossible for Woo Sae-geon to lose, I briefly thought the kill arrow was wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If even I watching from multiple angles felt that way, then everyone watching the match would feel the same.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mung-mung. But thinking about it now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Woof.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Mung-mung answered in a half-drowsy voice. Even though Mung-mung doesn’t understand, he gives the best responses, making him good for talking to myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Maybe First Call’s strategy in Set 3 was also considering the show?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if it was a show where ‘they weren’t the protagonists,’ because they sensed a picture that could be more impressive afterward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Except for that lowly bastard Agni. That bastard would never yield the protagonist role.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, even if that’s true, that’s only until Set 3.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What they want now would be more picture-perfect play—namely, a comeback victory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Drowsiness was gradually approaching, so I briefly turned on the chat notifications I had turned off for the match before sleeping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I activated chat, private messages flooded in. I squinted my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guys remaining at school must be curious about the situation here.
