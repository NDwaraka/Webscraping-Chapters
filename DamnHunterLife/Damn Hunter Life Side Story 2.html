 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As dawn broke, the screen on the other side, which had been dark, also gradually brightened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Enough for Han Hyeong-woo to distinguish Cheon Gang-hyeon’s face with his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had fallen asleep after crying with a childlike face. His eyes were red and swollen from continuously rubbing them while crying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo brought his finger to the phone screen. His finger circled in front of it as if stroking his forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had no way of knowing why he had cried, but…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It overlapped with Gang-hyeon from that time. The image of him violently pushing Han Hyeong-woo away and then sitting down crying loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His broken self and broken memories. After finally confronting the truth he had been avoiding all this time, he cried without even knowing why he was crying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That confusion would continue from now on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He wouldn’t have wanted to cry in front of me. Then, and now too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo quietly closed his eyes at the pain that felt like his heart had been stabbed hard. He carefully controlled his breathing that was about to go astray.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He felt like he would collapse before Gang-hyeon did. He desperately wished for the year to pass quickly more than anyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Overwhelmed by the despair of not being able to hold Gang-hyeon right now, he wished the system would just break completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I woke up in the morning, the video call was still on until then. I made eye contact with Ja Hyeong-woo who was lying on his side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was dazed for a while by his unfathomably deep gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Don’t tell me you didn’t sleep?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I slept.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I believe it or not?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing Ja Hyeong-woo who had stayed by my side through the screen throughout my sleep, embarrassment surged up. I abruptly turned off the phone’s video call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Disgusting bastard. Sweet bastard……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think I have to admit it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was the one who said I wanted to be together then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m more lonely than Ja Hyeong-woo. Right now, I needed Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From that day on, there were no more incidents of me crying and making a fuss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, the video call time got longer. Ja Hyeong-woo tried to stay connected with me somehow whenever he had a chance, like he’d left a 7-year-old alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, he listens to me grumbling all day long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What does Ja Hyeong-woo find cute about this kind of guy that he keeps contacting?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought carelessly, then was startled and swallowed the curse in my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We even ate meals together with the video call screen on. Ja Hyeong-woo carefully adjusted the screen angle so both the lunch tray on the table and himself were visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you filming a mukbang?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I briefly imagined Ja Hyeong-woo doing a mukbang broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if viewers appeared, he’d chase them all away. ……Leaving only me in the chat room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo laid out school lunch, while I spread out side dishes I’d bought from a side dish store on the table. We started eating simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rested my chin on my hand and watched Ja Hyeong-woo’s spoon crisscross across his meal tray for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it good?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo flinched and looked at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, his ears turned slightly red. He just nodded a couple times with his mouth full of food.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eat a lot.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today’s Hunter School lunch menu was fish cutlet and beef radish soup. I secretly searched on my phone for whether there were any restaurants nearby that delivered that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for Manager Park Yoon-seok occasionally looking after me, I was alone like living by myself. Even so, my emotions that had been anxiously fluctuating gradually stabilized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I won’t deny that I faithfully receive Ja Hyeong-woo’s contacts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What did you do today?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you an hour ago.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yeah, I know. But you had an hour after we hung up. What did you do during that hour?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo obsessively wanted to know all my whereabouts. He was like a remote stalker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to answer when I stopped and looked at the books stacked horizontally on my desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [GED Workbook]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [CSAT English Basics]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Essence of Mathematics]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I bought workbooks. I’m going to take college entrance exams.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the result of pondering for days about what to do with my life going forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If a young Korean person has no particular job or career they want to pursue, they start by preparing for the CSAT.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You’ll do well. You were so smart. You read a textbook once and scored 95 points.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wasn’t that in elementary school? What use is doing well back then?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was as happy as if I had already gotten into college. He was a crazy fool for his child.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I want to do it too.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Study.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had seen something at the illusion gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dictation test 20 points, never rose above middle ranks throughout elementary school. A guy who’s naturally physical-oriented, where it doesn’t work whether he tries or not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who didn’t know his place, was stubborn.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I don’t train as much as before now, so I have time in the evening. Let’s do it together. With video call on.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually that evening we opened books side by side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced at Ja Hyeong-woo beyond the screen while listening to high school math lectures.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the screen propped up against the desk wall, Ja Hyeong-woo…… had his head drooping down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s like me. Me during training.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His disheveled hair hung down below the desk. He dozed off nodding like a sick chicken, no, a sick mouse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was hard to say it was because training was tough. That guy has stamina.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The workbook just shot him with an anesthetic gun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For 3 hours in the evening, there was no miracle of Ja Hyeong-woo staying properly awake for even 5 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Such evenings continued the next day and the day after that too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I called Sa Ye-ho to talk behind Ja Hyeong-woo’s back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, he says he wants to go to the same university as me. But looking at what that blockhead bastard is doing, it’s impossible.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, Ja Hyeong-woo is whining not to enter university before him, to study one more year and enter the same year.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was excited for some reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Come to our school, come to our school! I’ll treat you well.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No way. You’re a popular kid.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hey, that’s old news. When I return from leave, everyone will avoid me.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yeah, so I’ll probably avoid you too. I gave him a harsh response and hung up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had forgotten. That Sa Ye-ho was a prestigious university student on leave. How did that school end up accepting someone like Sa Ye-ho?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And how did I end up with such an unhelpful study mate?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The big guy fills the screen with his bulk, sleeping soundly with just his neck bent down. The pen stuck between his fingers just stayed there continuously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, wake up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He might as well go lie down comfortably and sleep. Why suffer unnecessarily? Contrary to my feelings, I grumbled crookedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do something to stay awake.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who wiped around his mouth with the back of his hand, looked at me cautiously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“……Anything is okay?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just be quiet so you don’t break the study atmosphere.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At most he’d probably do something like stare at my face. It’s not like that idiot staring is a new thing. I calmly resumed the lecture and continued studying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between the online instructor’s voice, something like slightly rough breathing could be heard. It was the sound Ja Hyeong-woo was making—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing!?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pushed back my chair and stood up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t heard wrong. Even at this moment, Ja Hyeong-woo was breathing roughly through his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I know without having to say it. When Ja Hyeong-woo makes sounds with that kind of feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What that bastard…… was doing with his hand under the desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Huu…… To wake up.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What kind of crazy perverted bastard does that…… that to wake up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t continue speaking and trembled with anger. My whole body vibrated as if I was cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Ja Hyeong-woo had been caught masturbating while watching me study, his eyes were unnecessarily serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I wouldn’t feel like doing it if I were outside. It’s just you and me here.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I knew it, his eyes had taken on a complex light. His hand had also stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I miss you. We haven’t been able to meet for too long. This is too cruel.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s voice trembled slightly. That trembling felt like it gripped my heart tightly and then let go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since we’d been separated, this was the first time Ja Hyeong-woo had directly mentioned our relationship. For the past few days, we’d been treating each other casually like friends…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Yeah, crazy bastard…… I’ll study while you masturbate.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I straightened up the fallen chair and sat down with a thud. I looked at the problem sheet while desperately struggling not to pay attention to the front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should have bought earplugs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The small sounds that unwillingly pierced my ears gradually became more explicit. At first it was the swish-swish sound of skin friction. Then at some point lewd wet sounds mixed in, soon making squelching noises.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can hear all the sounds!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slammed the desk and stood up again after 5 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you telling me to solve problems or not to?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Not to.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m sorry.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quickly lowered his eyes and the corners of his mouth. Only then did he turn off his microphone. (It took 3 whole minutes to find the mute button.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even without sound, I was conscious of what was in front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Frowning around his eyes, occasionally wetting his lips with his tongue. His face gradually became languid. His thick neck glistened with sweat as he swallowed saliva intermittently. His half-opened eyes revealed the climactic feeling he was experiencing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Ja Hyeong-woo stopped the movement of his shoulders and trembled slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you saw it without knowing the situation, he’d just be a person with a strange face, but under that desk…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A moment later, Ja Hyeong-woo opened his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m fully awake now. I’ll study again.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I bit my lips, trying to calm my burning face. I forced myself to read the problems.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, Ja Hyeong-woo dozed off again after that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I lay down to sleep that night, something that shouldn’t have come to mind came to mind, as if my head was spinning too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One day at Hunter School, having sex with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, Ja Hyeong-woo was straddling me with exactly the same face as earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body heated up a bit. While tossing and turning, my gaze suddenly went to my lower body. My lower body was quite close to my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Ah, this is too much.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hissing, I buried my head in the pillow and tried to sleep.
 </span>
</p>
