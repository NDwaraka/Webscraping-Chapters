<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For someone who looked bewildered, Beom I-ryeong seemed to understand quite well what situation he was in right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather, I’m being more stupid right now. What should I do with this new successor who suddenly dropped from the sky?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t really know, but for now I wrapped him in my clothes and brought him into the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If he’s fifteen, he needs to grow taller, so let’s put him to bed first. I’ll handle the work in the morning……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s absolutely not procrastinating, and it would be awkward to wake everyone up noisily in the dawn when everyone was asleep. Moreover, the kid looked mentally hazy too, so I had no intention of making a fuss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gave Beom I-ryeong my bed. Beom I-ryeong obediently went under the covers and squirmed around to find a comfortable position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It doesn’t seem like his voice has changed yet. He doesn’t look like a middle school second-year.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how I look at him, he seems younger, but since the minimum age for Hunter School is fifteen, he must be fifteen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong, covered with the blanket, stared at me with wide-open eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sleep well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I whispered softly, meaning for him to trust me even if he was confused. And as I turned around, my sleeve was suddenly grabbed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Isn’t this hyung-nim’s bed?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyung-nim. Is my age at that level? Fifteen and twenty-three…… that’s about right. Yeah, at least I’m not an uncle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You use it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s sleep together. I’m fine with it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The voice speaking calmly was well-behaved. There was no sign of annoyance to be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I should treat him gently. Even if it doesn’t suit my temperament.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is also a virtue of a leader. Though someone else never did that at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do that, then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I took out another blanket from the wooden cabinet and crawled onto the bed. We covered ourselves with separate blankets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong lay beside me and stared intently at me. Before I knew it, he had turned his whole body toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Curious eyes focused intently on my profile. I couldn’t think of anything to say in response, so I just looked at the ceiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……It must have been difficult.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I received something like comfort from a fifteen-year-old.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once again, I resented Park Yoon-seok. That uncle did things I didn’t even ask for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sleep well. See you tomorrow.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong completely closed his eyes. Soon his breathing became steady.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Beom I-ryeong fell soundly asleep, I opened the status window that had been blinking since earlier and read the notification.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  The ‘Tiger’ successor’s existence has been confirmed.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next day passed in a flash without a moment to breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I delivered the successor information to the association and received Beom I-ryeong’s personal information.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  News was immediately reported outside as well. Inside, the ‘Tiger’ successor’s position was established.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello, hello.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho approached Beom I-ryeong, who was sitting on the office sofa with his knees together. He attempted small talk, being relatively well-behaved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong just nodded shyly without confidence. His gaze was fixed only on me at the desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A middle school student who lived on the outskirts of Busan. He grew up looking at the sea. He doesn’t use dialect.

<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: I’m the student council president, don’t I need to have a meeting with Beom I-ryeong’s parents?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor&gt;Me: If there was no request from parents then it’s fine
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The middle school Beom I-ryeong attended was apparently very small. Perhaps because of that, there wasn’t a trace of posts on the internet saying “That’s my friend, he’s from our school.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Articles about Beom I-ryeong were generally like this: Expectations that Beom I-ryeong would become a powerful weapon for ‘the lonely leader who rose above his past (I wish they wouldn’t call me this) Gyeon Gang-hyeon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Can’t they get by without mentioning me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, thanks to Beom I-ryeong, mentions of me in successor news are decreasing. It overlaps with when Won Ha-ri had just awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then, I childishly cheered because I was buried thanks to her, but I shouldn’t do that now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It must be sudden and disastrous for you…… but still, I lived thanks to you. Thank you for coming.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the meeting with the association president, I casually said to Beom I-ryeong, who looked tired. I bent my knees and made eye contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If I was helpful to hyung-nim, I’m happy too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was a strange kid in many ways. His build was small like an elementary school student, but his posture was upright, unlike an ordinary fifteen-year-old. He seemed calmer than me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to think about what I was like at that age…… but I need to remember for that to work. Damn amnesiac possessor’s life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then let me recall the original Gang-hyeon at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……Hmm, let’s not recall that. It would be a comparison.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment cheeky little Gang-hyeon came to mind, I stopped thinking after 1 second. Instead, I mulled over the current situation with Beom I-ryeong joining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tenth team member who joined after Yoon Sae-geon left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The recent burdensome stages. According to the hypothesis, the remaining stages are ’22’, ’11’, and ‘0’ stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Will Beom I-ryeong be able to fight in the final battle?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know he’s too young and inexperienced. It took Won Ha-ri a year to properly perform in stages too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I also learned that if the situation is really unfavorable, you can’t be picky about people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, it’s fortunate that there’s one more option to use.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With Beom I-ryeong’s consent, I decided to start training right away while I was at it. At the same time, I’m going to have him meet the other successors one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Me&gt;Rabbit Successor: Myo Cho-hui successor. Since you’re an attribute junior, I’d like you to assist with training.

  Me&gt;Rabbit Successor: You don’t need to split much time. Since I can guide all attributes, we can just split half and half

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a little worried, but I trust Myo Cho-hui’s public image.

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After leaving the kid in her care, I hurriedly dealt with other tasks in the meantime.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was so busy I could die. Just because a successor was added didn’t mean the existing workload decreased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While returning from inspecting the training grounds, the 154th duty of the student council president, I met a familiar face across from the earth attribute gym.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I waved first. The naive-looking face was startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Kwak Ji-hong, who had whined that he couldn’t do hunter work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I must be uncomfortable for him. I thought Kwak Ji-hong would just bow his head and scurry away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But surprisingly, that timid guy approached me closely. Then he hesitantly said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I started training. Even if I can’t enter actual combat. Since I’m the successor-nim’s first affiliated hunter…… I don’t want to embarrass you……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hadn’t the emotional pilgrimage of ordinary hunters ended yet? To think they even made this coward change. I stood with my mouth open for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong, who had been hesitantly raising his head, became dazed for a moment after checking my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s enough. You’re more admirable than me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as I passed by, Kwak Ji-hong looked back at me several times. When our eyes met, he startled and looked straight ahead. He looked even more dazed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I immediately headed to the training room where Myo Cho-hui and the young successor would be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed to be break time. Myo Cho-hui was standing some distance away, fiddling with her weapon, the glaive. Beom I-ryeong was sitting looking in a completely different direction. They looked very awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Boys who don’t know Myo Cho-hui’s true nature get embarrassed when they see her. But this kid is strange.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, a fresh energy that hadn’t been there before was faintly flowing from Beom I-ryeong’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my eyes wide and approached with heavy steps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You manifested your attribute? In just one hour?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong raised his head smoothly without being surprised. Myo Cho-hui nodded before Beom I-ryeong did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s impossible. Then his attribute affinity is higher than even mine.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Myo Cho-hui was an incredibly excellent teacher, affinity was largely innate. It meant Beom I-ryeong was a genius.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Beom I-ryeong saw me, he left Myo Cho-hui behind and came running to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At his obviously delighted expression, I glanced at Myo Cho-hui. Perhaps?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you looking at me like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s nothing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong pulled my hand and placed it on top of his head. It looked like he wanted me to pet him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, I flinched slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What is this? It feels a bit different from Hae Mi-jun.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wasn’t even smiling. That expressionless face was peculiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides, isn’t this the age to be full of bravado? Would an ordinary middle school boy normally try to use an adult man’s hand like this……?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……Never mind. It must be because he relies on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you already manifesting attributes? You don’t need to do that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t need to do that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I mean there’s no need to push yourself unnecessarily. Of course, the faster the better. It’s meal time, so let’s go eat.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong and I left the training ground together. While going to the cafeteria, I asked:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there any successor you’d like to meet and become close with? It’s uncomfortable because of our age difference. How about Hae Mi-jun?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong didn’t seem very enthusiastic. The silent Beom I-ryeong grabbed my sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to be with hyung-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he had seen Hae Mi-jun even once on a broadcast, he wouldn’t react like this. Or does he just admire me more?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This kid has gone down the wrong path.’
 </span>
</p>
