  ***
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The night after finishing the gate and returning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We did charge once during the strategy, but maybe because we went through battles after that too. After it ended, yang energy was subtly insufficient.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon tried to pretend not to notice, tidy up the office, and go home. But Ja Hyeong-woo followed Gang-hyeon around like a puppy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. We already did it today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon immediately frowned his pretty brow and refused.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today’s patience was over. He was worn ragged, having exceeded the limits of shame he could endure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During the gate, he’d committed acts unbecoming of a leader in the cave, and it wasn’t just kissing but something beyond that. Moreover, after finishing, he had to return to the students’ side and manage his expression. Even in front of Sa Ye-ho, his friend.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today he didn’t want to see Ja Hyeong-woo’s face anymore. He just wanted to shut down his brain and sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Still.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo still had a face full of obvious worry. When Gang-hyeon didn’t easily yield, he changed tactics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then what about me just holding you while we sleep? How about slowly filling it that way? I’ll make sure it’s not uncomfortable for sleeping.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No! Are you crazy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m embarrassed and excited too, but treatment is more important—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not excited! It’s disgusting!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, fed up with the continued persuasion, finally accepted his proposal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go home, wash up, and come back. And don’t come now. Come after 10 o’clock. If you touch or grope me with your hands, know that you’ll really die.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was telling him to come only after he’d fallen asleep, lie there when he wouldn’t know anything, then leave. The intention was clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo remained lost in troubled thoughts until the appointed time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Secretly when he’s asleep…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having committed sins, when he entered the dark room, his chest ached familiarly like before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That past would hold onto his feet for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon was lying on one side of the spacious bed with his back turned. His body was slightly curled up, creating a round mound shape under the blanket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His heart beat violently. It was terribly bad for a situation where he needed to sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Can I really go inside there?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bed creaked as weight was added to it, the springs making faint noise. Ja Hyeong-woo swallowed and lifted the blanket on the back side. He slowly pushed his legs into the blanket first. Even while lying down, he constantly watched Gang-hyeon’s closed, clear face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The body scent thoroughly soaked into the pillowcase and blanket surrounded Ja Hyeong-woo’s body. He finished his slow movements and pressed his chest against the slender back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon woke up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he kept his eyes closed and didn’t move. Did he think Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t know he was awake?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he was already awake… Ja Hyeong-woo shifted his body slightly to readjust his position. He slipped his arm under Gang-hyeon’s head to serve as an arm pillow. Then when he pressed his body lying on its side against him again, Gang-hyeon came completely into his embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon desperately tried to maintain the pretense of sleeping, but he was already too stiff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, he stopped hiding behind the pretense of sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Move back a bit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The muffled voice echoing on the bed was pleasant to hear. The slightly drowsy state too. His heart naturally warmed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I need to be touching you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s uncomfortable.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It doesn’t seem like it’s to the point where you can’t sleep, so bear with it to some degree.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon and he no longer had to fight by speaking angrily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now Ja Hyeong-woo could speak with his true nature, like in childhood… and Gang-hyeon would listen to his words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had been silent for a moment, hesitantly snapped in frustration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It’s poking me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was working on that part too. Since they were pressed close together under one blanket, it was an unavoidable matter, but he could calm it down if he took a little time. Ja Hyeong-woo pretended not to know and soothed Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you don’t think about it, it’ll be fine. Go back to sleep.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon grumbled something and rested his head on the arm again. His hair scattered messily, and the sweet body scent enchanted Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As time passed, his body adapted. The blanket warmed by body temperature was very drowsy. Thanks to the flesh scent rising cozily too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The drowsy atmosphere loosened Ja Hyeong-woo’s restraints. His lips moved on their own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I thought you hated me because only I awakened and you couldn’t awaken. Or that you’d been sick of me from before.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon was quiet. He could tell he was listening, but there was no way to know what he was thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So while I understood you… my hurt feelings grew large and I think I didn’t treat you well. There was also the fact that you’d be horrified if I treated you gently.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought awakening was the problem. But even after awakening, Gang-hyeon hadn’t dealt with Ja Hyeong-woo for quite a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “By any chance, were there other reasons why our relationship was bad? What have you been thinking of me all this time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wasn’t thinking of voicing complaints or dissatisfaction. He just asked casually out of curiosity. Ja Hyeong-woo had no hatred left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon opened his eyes in the darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since realizing they’d been hiding many things from each other, they’d promised to speak honestly and only the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, there are truths that absolutely cannot be spoken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You’re big and disgusting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon blurted out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was somewhat shocked. From their first meeting in early childhood, he’d always been bigger than Gang-hyeon. So he hadn’t known that Gang-hyeon would find his size burdensome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I cut it off and reattach it then heal, would it get smaller?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d never cared about appearance in his life. He seriously felt like looking in a mirror. If he hadn’t been holding Gang-hyeon, he would have immediately gotten up and headed straight to the bathroom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I lose all the muscle? Does it look bad?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you crazy? You’re a hunter. Just leave it and live muscular for life.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A low rumbling sound tapped at his ear. Gang-hyeon realized a beat late that Ja Hyeong-woo had laughed out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I like everything about you. Not just in general, but I like how you look too. The way you blush too. I like it even more now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to hear it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More laughter came out. He almost hugged Gang-hyeon tightly with his other arm. That would make him have a fit, so Ja Hyeong-woo held back firmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Disappear before I wake up in the morning. Got it? You’re going to wake up earlier than me anyway. Don’t make me wake up in a good mood only to have it ruined by seeing you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when he threatened without affection, Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t hurt in the slightest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, he complained that it was stuffy and heavy, that that thing was touching his butt, then quickly fell asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Ja Hyeong-woo relax his arm and savor the sound of peaceful breathing in his embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How did I ever think of secretly kissing such a peaceful face?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Gang-hyeon had become generous with him, the inappropriately growing lust also found its proper boundaries. Being happy now without needing to do that was better. He was pickled every second in a sensation like sweet taste spreading *tingle* in his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only flaw might be that the inside of his long hair was gradually getting damp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m hot but it’s warm for Gang-hyeon. What should I do?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From now on, if we’re going to sleep together, I’ll have to take off my top.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had decided arbitrarily, gazed at the round crown of his head again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He doesn’t allow this kind of thing to other people either, so he doesn’t seem to think badly of me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While sinking into satisfying fantasies…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His head wasn’t entirely full of stars.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon still had resentment piled up inside. He said it was because he was disgusting, but Ja Hyeong-woo was certain there was a more fundamental cause.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll have to hover around until he tells me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As promised, he left heaven on his own when dawn was breaking. Before leaving, he wanted to press his lips to that pretty forehead, but he didn’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t do things like this. Gang-hyeon didn’t say it was okay to do this. I must only treat him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He kept repeating such words in his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ***
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All morning, he endured Ja Hyeong-woo sitting pressed in the office grinning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even then, they had to repeat spear and shield-like bickering. When Ja Hyeong-woo suggesting eating together and Gang-hyeon insisting there were other people were making quite a commotion in front of the office.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung, would you like to have a meal together?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun appeared from somewhere and saved Gang-hyeon again this time. He grabbed his arm right in front of Ja Hyeong-woo and brought him to his own place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon felt that the sense of unease he’d felt before wasn’t just his imagination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hae Mi-jun does need to be a bit more assertive… but changing overnight like this is also a bit scary.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was stranger was that Hae Mi-jun, who had started eating face-to-face like that, was unusually quiet today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is something wrong?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, no… I just have some things to think about. I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, it’s fine. I’m thinking too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence wasn’t common, but they weren’t at the level of being awkward either. Gang-hyeon lost focus in his eyes and concentrated only on chewing his food for the first time in a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During that time, Hae Mi-jun monopolized Gang-hyeon with his eyes to his heart’s content. As if seeing him now was the last time, he passionately took him in and took him in again with his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The memories he possessed came up one by one. What kind of person had Gang-hyeon hyung been to him?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re too precious to hear such words. You’re not someone who should be treated that way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d appeared suddenly and changed Hae Mi-jun’s world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If I said I could develop your abilities, would you believe me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d simply accomplished impossible things. He’d cast magic with his voice and hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now he didn’t know how proud he was to be the first person to receive his special ability.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because he was also male, he’d harbored impure feelings too. The moment he realized that Gang-hyeon hyung was the prettiest among people he’d seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They’d spent nearly ten months together. His expressions and way of speaking, the way he moved his fingers and blinked his eyelashes when talking. He’d delighted in savoring his large and small details.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d dared to dream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he became a more excellent healer, wouldn’t he be able to stand by his side?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Gang-hyeon of the past few days… was a bit different from the one Hae Mi-jun had known until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, sad ripples rose in Hae Mi-jun’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon hyung, what I was thinking was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I should have just let you go eat with Hyeong-woo hyung earlier.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanly, he’d taken advantage of the fact that Gang-hyeon was considerate to him. He’d deliberately tried to separate him from Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t do it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He suddenly made eye contact with Gang-hyeon who was drinking water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
