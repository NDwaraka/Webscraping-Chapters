 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unusually today, when I opened the office door, Sa Ye-ho wasn’t there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because of the habit formed during this time, whether he came to play games or whatever, Sa Ye-ho always arrived first and opened the locked door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hi…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only much later did he appear, opening the door with a shuffling gait. With a face that had completely lost its mind overnight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What’s wrong with him?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It doesn’t seem like he gamed all night. After I became leader, he didn’t just do random stuff like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then there must be someone capable of making the carefree Sa Ye-ho skin and bones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did the Association nag about this time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Our puppy’s intuition is level 100…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What kind of fight did you have? If you’re in that state, Kim Jae-moon must have bandages around his ears.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho sprawled on the sofa and laughed weakly. Yet he still didn’t open his mouth first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your mouth is unnecessarily heavy only at times like this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only when I snapped at him irritably did he finally speak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just… how Gang-hyeon is doing, whether he’s doing well… that kind of thing. Since he’s too busy to ask you directly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I weakly kicked under the desk and removed my fingers from the keyboard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho has the ability to smoothly brush off the Association’s nagging with his slick responses. That it was still hard to shake off was probably because his opponent was someone who’d been entrenched in a government agency for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, it seemed like several hours of fruitless argument had continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something Woo Sae-geon probably went through once in the very early days of Hunter School, when young people under 24 took their first steps in a situation where they were responsible for Korea’s safety.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —The public’s concerns are endless. Of course, the Association will fully support Successor Woo Sae-geon’s actions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —What will today’s schedule be like? How about broadcasting part of it publicly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Young people were trapped in unconfirmed gates, and families clamored outside demanding their return. People were dying throughout Korea, and young people doing dangerous training without adult intervention had to step up and save them. Given the situation and the hunters’ age group, it could be seen as natural worry and intervention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But actually, age was just a superficial reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s noise generated because the higher-ups can’t accept hunters as special beings. It would have been the same even if battle-hardened adults had ended up at Hunter School. It probably would have been the same even if someone like a police chief had been the school head.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gates and monsters from another world, unexplainable by modern science, were exactly that kind of shock to people. A time when they just spat out worries not knowing what to do, pushing their anxiety and burdens onto someone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that sense, creating and utilizing the existence of ‘successors’ was an excellent choice for calming chaos. Because people want heroes while finding them awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But the most outstanding among them, Woo Sae-geon, is gone?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even defeated all the Myodusa in recent stages himself, leaving an unforgettable impact before leaving like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only I, a former delinquent, was left here alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Really, Woo Sae-geon passed leadership to me to screw me over…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All domestic and international news talked about Korea’s #1’s retirement, and most of them mentioned my name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The original work’s Ja Hyeong-woo just cut himself off from the world, so while others were frustrated, he himself was very stubborn.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I’m not Ja Hyeong-woo, right? I’m concerned that Sa Ye-ho’s energy is being drained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The Association is above successors, but the public is above the Association.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I decided to put the idea I’d been thinking about into practice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho. There’s The Hero broadcast team, right? Do you have their personal number?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. PD Hong Jeong-hyeok.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to Yoon Sae-geon’s exclusion policy (plus my track record), that place was virtually the only one exclusively covering successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that person the head? Contact them and suggest doing a special feature.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a bit worried about giving them too much power… but anyway, Association permission is needed to film the training grounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that’s the case, it’s better to include the broadcast team and split it with the Association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Peeking at Successor Joint Training, something like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was something the upright Woo Sae-geon would never have suggested first, even if it killed him. Sa Ye-ho’s squinted eyes opened wide.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho seemed more interested than worried. Getting up from the sofa, Sa Ye-ho leaned his upper body toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you confident?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, I’m also in charge of the group training that Woo Sae-geon used to lead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wild horse-like Ma Cheon-ah, Yang Pyo who doesn’t understand well, and Hae Mi-jun who’s so gentle he’s soft—I have to command all of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had the presence to control and lead all of them. But me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How easy must the new leader look? Gyeon Gang-hyeon teaching someone? Everyone’s probably just putting up question marks.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Plus I have no authority and my attitude is endlessly light. Will group training led by such a me actually work?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s why I’ll show them. Just how it really is.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll make that Kim Jae-moon guy shut his mouth tight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Literally a sneaky feeling like peeking at joint training through door cracks was the concept of this coverage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successor training ground, revealed publicly for the first time in months, glittered with five-colored attack effects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Familiars were attacking successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A fresh green rabbit, a heavy brown dragon, and a house-sized boar with blue waves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the video was first released, the chat window was filled with ‘…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an even more shocking sight because these were successors and their familiars known to be model students or colleague-friendly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Is it okay for familiars to attack the kids?’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Even Woo Sae-geon didn’t go that far lol;;’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And in the center of the space where they were rampaging was the new leader, pale as his white clothes…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Commanding the familiars while emitting a sharper aura than imagined. The three unnaturally moving familiars looked as if they were his minions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A short video was inserted explaining how the familiars could attack their owners’ colleagues.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Today, rabbit, dragon, and pig will be used as monster roles.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The voice that had been evaluated as clear but somewhat weak in successor cheering songs was quite resonant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But that doesn’t mean the owners need to give bad commands directly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering he was broadcasting, he suddenly stopped talking, inserted a brief pause, then spoke again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll control them, and I’ll also play the villain role. You just need to immerse yourselves and fight like it’s real combat.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since VR simulation had limitations, Gyeon Gang-hyeon utilized familiars as fake monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his affinity ability that made even others’ familiars serve him as master.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Is that possible?’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon seems more like a bug character as time goes on’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If I use others’ familiars too much, their connection with their original owners might weaken, plus it drains a lot of my stamina. Real combat training will always be short. Within 20 minutes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To extract maximum efficiency in a short time, he drove them as roughly as possible to produce results.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The rabbit leaped up as if to trample people, and the boar charged frighteningly to instill terror. The dragon stirred between them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his mouth firmly shut, Gyeon Gang-hyeon pressured the young successors without blinking an eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui participated in training together, assisting the monster roles with vines. Surprisingly, she stood side by side next to Gyeon Gang-hyeon. It wasn’t just for the broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>

  ‘Those two are pretty close.’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Unexpected’
 </b>

<p>

  ‘Pretty’

  ‘Gang-hyeon doesn’t lose in looks either lolololololol’

<p>

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was one step away from getting the new nickname “Demon King.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He drove the younger ones who had been laughing and chatting with him until just before to the point of gasping for breath. Whether Hae Mi-jun fell or not, he was merciless without any consideration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo! Not watching behind you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry, sorry!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut your mouth and move!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>

  ‘He’s not a dog but a tiger?’
 </b>
</p>
<p>

  ‘Just a crazy dog.’

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Woo Sae-geon ran alongside them and played the monster role himself, Gyeon Gang-hyeon just stood there shouting orders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It might certainly look annoying to viewers’ eyes…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the novelty from Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s different side was greater. Even the strong-willed Ma Cheon-ah was startled by Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s shouting and obediently followed well—he seemed like a different person. To the extent that you’d wonder if Ma Cheon-ah had some weakness seized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the reason for this was revealed within just a few minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After shouting “Hey!” forcefully, Gyeon Gang-hyeon clutched his chest and coughed. Everyone flinched then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>

  ‘So they were scared Gang-hyeon might die’

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One VJ who had been assigned a remote camera discovered Ja Hyeong-woo anxiously watching such Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Ja Hyeong-woo was alone and not in training, thinking he had nothing to lose, the VJ approached Ja Hyeong-woo and attempted a brief interview.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Q. You’ve welcomed a new leader, how is it?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And asked properly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo answered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon has been good at taking the lead and guiding someone since childhood. He’s naturally born to draw others to him. He can do it, and he should.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His gaze became much gentler. His eyes softened with affection. Thanks to this, for almost the first time, the broadcast could capture Ja Hyeong-woo’s appearance to its advantage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now other people are seeing Gang-hyeon correctly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That appearance as if he were enchanted by someone.
