<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I steadied my trembling legs from the height and waited for monsters to appear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The terrain is beyond imagination, isn’t it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. It’s dizzying.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is something I’ve only seen in games…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was terrain that defied common sense. Several large stone islands were floating in mid-air, and we were standing on those stones. Even the stage entrance itself was created in mid-air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting aside how these islands stayed afloat, it was spectacular how waterfalls were formed from the large lakes on each island, flowing endlessly down to the bottomless depths below.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tensed my neck to avoid unconsciously looking down at the cliff bottom that looked pitch black and made me dizzy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, Sa Ye-ho was clinging to the edge of the island, sticking his head out boldly over the gaping cliff and peering around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What would happen if we fell down there?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you even thinking about falling?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just imagining it made my liver flutter, so I crossed my arms as naturally as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no idea why Sa Ye-ho even entered this stage. The monsters here are water attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was Woo Sae-geon thinking bringing him instead of Yang Pyo who’s earth attribute?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know if Sa Ye-ho threw a tantrum to come or what, but looking at the stage situation, it was surprisingly a good choice. I lightly chewed my lower lip and opened the chat window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Me: Doesn’t it seem like the stage is also predicting and sniping us?

</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I said such ominous words out loud and it got filmed completely, it would only stimulate people’s anxiety for no reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If we’re going to be anxious, it’s better if only we’re anxious. We’re the ones fighting anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Since the monsters use water attributes, we’ll mainly come with earth. It seems like they knew this and completely removed earth from the terrain
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: If that’s true, the difficulty is going up like hell
 </b>
</p>
<p>

  Snake Successor: You’re right

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of all times, in Woo Sae-geon’s last stage before retirement…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I be glad that we’re experiencing this for the first time while Woo Sae-geon is still here, rather than after he’s gone?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who was biting his lips, stuck closer to my side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More than anything else, I trembled slightly because I thought the floating island had just swayed a bit. I pretended to be calm and thought carefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If stages come out this way… we should also consider returning to the balanced composition Woo Sae-geon used in the early days.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this should be something Ja Hyeong-woo thinks about, not me. As the next leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced at Ja Hyeong-woo behind us, scanning the surroundings for monsters with an expressionless face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Honestly, Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t particularly clever…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now I thought Ja Hyeong-woo would just do well and let it pass, but I haven’t actually seen the latter part of the original work directly either. Moreover, this guy is different from the original. The current Ja Hyeong-woo is mentally at ease because Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t die, but in exchange he’s quite dull.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Would Ja Hyeong-woo be able to command battles well?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while I was having all these random thoughts, Woo Sae-geon remained silent. Since the leader who should have given instructions long ago was quiet, I ended up taking charge and calling out first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader. Leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon lifted his head slightly. He glanced at me once then put on a thoughtful expression again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ignoring others’ words was the same as usual, but if something looked a little different, was it just my imagination?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today’s Woo Sae-geon seemed a bit dazed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…The terrain is outside expected parameters. Be careful using earth skills. There’s a possibility the entire island could crash. I’m restricting the use of earth attribute skills I’m mentioning now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  See? That’s exactly what I said earlier, but now he’s saying it as if his situational comprehension is delayed even after hearing it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s eyes still looked sunken somewhere. Definitely, the recent disgrace he’d been covered with had dealt him a blow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he’s sluggish here, people will think ‘he’s flustered,’ and that becomes humiliating for Woo Sae-geon. The vicious cycle will repeat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Does that person also get conditioning problems when under a lot of stress?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suspect so.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he’s someone whose mental strength stat was particularly low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the skills Woo Sae-geon listed intermittently was my skill &lt;Lonely Gravedigger&gt;. The result of my abilities being almost completely excavated by Woo Sae-geon despite my constant efforts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, another floating island rose up in front of the island we were on, attaching itself like a ship docking at a port.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone was dismayed seeing the huge life form riding on that island.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A boss appears right from the start? Or does this stage have no small fry to begin with?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This monster was the myodusa, a legendary animal known to possess water powers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A very large snake with a cat’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, Ye-ho. You have a lot of kinfolk. Like that four-headed insect before.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The myodusa looked down at us one by one with that uniquely eerie and persistent gaze like a wild cat encountered at night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then blue smoke suddenly spewed from its body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who was at the front, let out a short groan and pulled his body back. Jin Seol-woon, who had quickly increased the distance, was furrowing his brow as if in pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s arm had lightly touched the blue smoke. As soon as it touched that smoke, opaque steam rose up as if it was melting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s clothes were melting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, since he pulled back immediately, only the sleeve of his clothes melted and his skin seemed unharmed. The damage was limited to slightly reddened bare skin being exposed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We can’t approach like that. What should we do? Leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the only sound Woo Sae-geon made was to not get close to the myodusa and maintain a certain distance. Since the myodusa doesn’t spew smoke beyond a certain range.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt not just bewildered, but even betrayed. I stared at Woo Sae-geon’s pale face as he narrowed his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is he really in a panic state? Then what are we supposed to do?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Sa Ye-ho, the next most reliable person, seemed unable to think straight as his attention kept going to Woo Sae-geon. He kept glancing at Woo Sae-geon with upset eyes, just frowning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Dragon Successor&gt;Me: Gang-hyeon-ssi, what should we do?

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s when my eyes met Jin Seol-woon’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why are you asking me that…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Jin Seol-woon strangely, as if he’d been looking only at me from the beginning without looking at Woo Sae-geon… very naturally demanded an answer from me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Dragon Successor&gt;Me: What do you think would be good?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Damn. This cursed special vision is to blame.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I eventually acknowledged that the responsibility to find a solution after Woo Sae-geon fell on me and glared at the myodusa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The myodusa is a legendary animal said to emit blue water energy containing healing power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, it seems that energy acts as deadly poison to humans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then should Hae Mi-jun use detox skills? No. The myodusa emits energy every moment without any restrictions, but Hae Mi-jun can’t continuously supply skills to six people including himself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then what should we do?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There wasn’t much time, but this is exactly when you need to think calmly. I have to dig in from the essence. There must be a way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The poisonous energy the myodusa used was basically in the form of thick fog. But when it stuck to Jin Seol-woon earlier, the flow changed as if coating Jin Seol-woon’s clothes and skin with a membrane… Huh?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had seen an ability with a similar pattern somewhere before. I frantically racked my brain at the sense of déjà vu. What was it? What was it similar to?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if suddenly pulling up a memory, I quickly turned to look at someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Ja Hyeong-woo, who was waiting for my words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, take out the weakest of your curse skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately, bundled bells appeared in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hands. It was Ja Hyeong-woo’s attack skill following talismans and gourds. Was it a curse that made all senses more sensitive?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You want to use a curse on monsters in this situation?’ He might find it puzzling, but Ja Hyeong-woo was silent. I briefly found it strange that Ja Hyeong-woo listened to my words without questioning or arguing, but soon forgot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Use the curse skill on us.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before uttering my next words, I looked into everyone’s eyes one by one. Reluctantly, but including Woo Sae-geon too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “From what I can see, the attack the myodusa uses is also classified as a curse skill. The energy looked exactly the same. But debuff skills can’t stack others once one is applied. So let’s experiment first, and if it’s as I think, let’s fight while covered in curse skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The test subject was Woo Sae-geon, who though temporarily silent, always had a solid body. While Ja Hyeong-woo was going over there, I quickly reorganized the formation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader, move around freely like a midfielder and use your strength. That seems like it would be most helpful. Everyone else just fight while maintaining your positions. Be careful of the floor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because they’re used to taking orders due to Woo Sae-geon, these grown guys earnestly listen to even my shoddy briefing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon, I know you’ve been practicing attacks, but go back to being main tanker just for today. Protect me and Ja Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Understood.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho, your attribute directly opposes the myodusa’s, so stay far away for now. Why did you even come here? No, this isn’t the time for such talk. Still, among your skills there should be something that would work on the myodusa. Let’s use that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okay, sounds good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sent Ja Hyeong-woo as sub-healer to maintain debuff skills. Even if healing was somewhat insufficient, I had to switch Hae Mi-jun to main healer instead of Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, save enough to use detox skills once per person after everything’s over!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
