  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 111
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shock made my head ring. Agni continued speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「I wasn’t planning to say this originally. That I have feelings for you. Because I’m supposed to be the villain, you know. I had to do only things that would make you dislike me」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though my expression probably looked like I was seeing an alien, Agni didn’t seem embarrassed or hurt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「I know. It’s confusing and you won’t understand. But um… I’m sincere」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wish he’d stop babbling… I desperately prayed inwardly. My head felt like it would explode from the dizziness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「It was a short time, but I’m certain my feelings are right. You looked pretty, confident, and honest. I fell for you at first sight」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I could half-ignore it because it was in English, how could I not notice when his gaze was completely unhinged as he looked at me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pretty? That was probably him saying my face was passable while wearing rose-colored glasses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking confident was because I acted that way on purpose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being honest… I don’t think that’s right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「But I guess I knew. That this would be our last moment before you go back. So I ended up revealing everything about myself」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My complexion had undoubtedly turned pale. My fingertips and cheeks were cold. Agni looked at my expression and smiled bitterly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「I just want to be friends at least… could you give me your contact info? Email is fine too」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Phew… let me get my bearings. I have to answer the question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grabbed hold of myself and tried not to show my dizziness. I barely managed to open my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「It would be hard to keep in touch knowing those feelings. I’m sorry」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni nodded quietly as if he’d expected this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「I see. At least you’re forgiving me」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, my spine went cold. Wondering if I’d just given him some hope.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Just now, I came to think you’re an even better person. I don’t regret saying I like you. …Take care. I’m sorry, and thank you」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni quietly stepped back. He didn’t seem to have no lingering feelings, but his attitude was clean. His retreating figure looked relieved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after Agni left, I stood nailed to that spot for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I realized how narrow-minded my thinking had been until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s a lot of love in the world, but I thought it was a story that didn’t apply to me. I believed it had nothing to do with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Who would want someone like me with such a weird personality.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would have been shocking even if it were a woman, but for the other person to be a man on top of that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been standing far away, slowly approached. He was struggling desperately to hold back laughter, wheezing without being able to breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, are you okay? What are you thinking about?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho patted my shoulder with his palm. I was so dazed that my body swayed with his tapping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You got properly hit by a confession attack.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Really, I’d never expected this kind of confrontation. Even Sa Ye-ho’s giggling sounded muffled as if it were far away. Stupid words automatically came out of my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How is that even possible?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why wouldn’t it be possible? That kind of thing happens in the world.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been snickering, asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Have you never thought that there might be homosexuals around you in your life?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not what I meant…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was blinking when I suddenly thrust my face toward Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you gay by any chance?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s just an example.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked straight into my eyes while still grinning. Yeah, you must find this fucking hilarious… Since it’s not your business.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I let out a deep sigh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Having homosexuals around is one thing, but having someone say they like me is a different story.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I would absolutely never, ever date a man… absolutely never.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I remembered the dream content that had become almost faint. That dream… where Ja Hyeong-woo appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensations I’d barely forgotten during the match came flooding back. My face suddenly felt like it was on fire too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After screaming loud enough to lift the roof, I smacked my head with my hand. Sa Ye-ho thought it was because of Agni and cackled beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to the natural disaster that occurred just before returning, my heart became tattered as I barely made it back to my home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, since I’m a possessor, I don’t know where my real home is, and it’s strange that I think of Hunter School as home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You were really cool. Really! I could only see Gang-hyeon hyung back then. Actually, I still think about it…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, whom I met after a long time, grabbed me and went crazy talking about me during the last set.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Saying he wanted to talk about things he couldn’t say before, he invited me to his house from lunch, and now he’s sitting on the same sofa, clinging right to me and chattering away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of responding, I lowered my head and carefully examined his clear eyes. Sensing something unusual, Hae Mi-jun’s eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, let me ask you one thing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes? Yes…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Agni incident had left me with a kind of trauma.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who followed me unusually closely, suddenly seemed suspicious, so I felt like I needed to check once before treating him like before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t have any strange… other feelings for me, do you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did I speak too indirectly? But if I spoke more directly, it would likely become a case of narcissistic delusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether I looked like I had a prince complex or not didn’t matter, what was important was the expression Hae Mi-jun would make the moment he heard the question. I had to assess based on his instantaneous reaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I focused my eyes and observed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun seemed flustered. His eyelids blinked rapidly. His lips, rarely without any trace of a smile, let out a shocked voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How could I…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At those words, my face automatically brightened completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart became as bright as a New Year’s sunrise. That’s not it. Hae Mi-jun was just really following me in a genuinely wholesome way. I aged ten years.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ignore it, ignore it. I was just saying it. It’s nothing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After feeling relieved, guilt soon washed over me. I’m the impure trash. As if someone pure like Hae Mi-jun would do anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He just thinks he owes me a debt of gratitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s bright gaze stayed on me for a moment, then moved to the side as if he wasn’t particularly suspicious. But soon he looked at me again with a flash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come to think of it, are you feeling okay? You worked hard during the match.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t an unusual greeting. Most people ask about my physical condition as their first greeting when they see me now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes it’s annoying, but with Hae Mi-jun specifically, it’s okay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine. I didn’t have much occasion to use skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I did have severe muscle pain after shooting the arrow Woo Sae-geon made, but Squeaky took care of that completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or not. When I move now, it seems like there’s still some stiffness left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “May I give you a massage? As a way of thanking you for your hard work in the match.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had been watching me slowly rotating my shoulders, suddenly asked carefully while showing both his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t have to. Well, go ahead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It feels like I’m receiving excessive respect from a kid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I readily gave permission and entrusted my back to him while sitting. Hae Mi-jun lightly touched his knees to my back. Fairly firm palms settled on both my shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as a handful of soft flesh was firmly kneaded, I let out a cry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, it hurts!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was startled. The sofa creaked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kid was so flustered that I was surprised too. I glanced back and quickly relaxed the tension in my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You thought too highly of me. You need to be gentler. Gentle.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who approached hesitantly, massaged my shoulders again. This time the intensity was just right. His grip pressed steadily along between my shoulders and neck, then pressed firmly on my nape. The scream turned into a satisfied groan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I exhaled deeply, Hae Mi-jun’s hands hesitated then moved again. Before I knew it, I was subtly waiting for him to continue massaging. After fully enjoying the massage while sprawled out, I suddenly said after a while:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Want to try massaging my legs too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to turn around, but Hae Mi-jun moved like a bullet to the front of me first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I paused while reaching for my pants.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body was so resistant to heat that even in midsummer, I had never worn pants shorter than ankle-length even inside the house. So I had never shown my bare legs to anyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at Hae Mi-jun’s innocent eyes, I thought what did it matter and rolled up my pant legs the rest of the way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun carefully pressed my calves with his fingertips. It felt good as expected. My body automatically lay back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, why are you doing my feet too? Wash your hands after…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t worry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun has talent… Why is he being so diligent about even this kind of thing? Thanks to that, my eyes became drowsy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When it became quiet, Hae Mi-jun looked up to find that Gyeon Gang-hyeon had fallen lightly asleep at some point. He could hear very soft breathing sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun closed his mouth and quietly got up from his spot. He tried not to look at the exposed, snow-white and smooth calves while pulling down Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s pant legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Would it be okay to use a stamina recovery skill on him?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been diligently training his water attribute, so now he had enough leeway to freely use low-grade recovery skills several times in daily life. Leader Woo Sae-geon had also given permission.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A pale sky-blue energy spread over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s forehead through Hae Mi-jun’s hands. His breathing became even quieter. He seemed to fall into comfortable sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sleep well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun whispered softly so as not to wake him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wondering if the air conditioner temperature was too cool, he brought a thin blanket to cover him. He crouched in front of him and watched over Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words Gang-hyeon hyung had said earlier lingered in his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t have any other feelings, do you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The truthful answer to that could only be given inwardly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How could I… have other feelings for someone as cool and pretty as Gang-hyeon hyung?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pounding that originated from his heart seemed to spread throughout his body. Hae Mi-jun thought he felt like crying a little for some reason.
 </span>
