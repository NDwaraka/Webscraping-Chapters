  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 149
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Neither acceptance nor refusal came out. I was just breathless. The shock hit me as if I’d suddenly been punched in the chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo got up from his seat and slowly walked around the dining table toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo knelt with both knees on the floor and matched eye level with me sitting in the chair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While observing my reaction, he untied the handkerchief that bound his hair. His dark blue hair fell down and flowed over his shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you letting your hair down?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because I like my hair cascading down to you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouldn’t have asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A body scent wafted richly from his scattered hair. It was a clean, somewhat sweet smell. Like when you chew rice in your mouth for a long time. …Ah, maybe it’s because he drank sikhye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yeah, it must be because of the sikhye…right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s no way I’d think Ja Hyeong-woo’s flesh smelled sweet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You smell nice.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo grabbed a handful of my hair and smelled the inside. Along with the sound of him breathing deeply, his chest muscles swelled even more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just do the treatment. Don’t indulge your personal desires.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So you do know that I have such desires for you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The crazy bastard still had his nose buried in my hair while saying something off-topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m grateful for just that. Just that you acknowledge it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt like my soul was leaving me. I newly realized this couldn’t be an attitude toward a friend.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll hold back and not look at you outside, so let’s have time like this just once a day. You can set a time limit if you want. Let’s do treatment and talk too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Treatment is necessary anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I now know too. The difference in my condition when Ja Hyeong-woo gave me yang energy versus when he didn’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I’d thought was just irregular up until now actually had a regular cycle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was still holding my hair while continuing to gaze at me deeply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Goosebumps had already risen, yet I continued to feel strange thrills flowing through my skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I reluctantly gave an answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “30 minutes a day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was going to say 20 minutes but changed my mind to 30 minutes at the last second, surely because my meager compassion kicked in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if either I or Ja Hyeong-woo run out of things to talk about, would we just do treatment for 30 minutes?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo slowly came closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I instinctively tried to flinch away. Ja Hyeong-woo watched my trembling eyelashes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Don’t grab me anywhere. Don’t do that thing where you wrap around my head and pull.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Got it. Then you don’t avoid me either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to watch the whole situation like looking at a needle when getting a shot. Even when something soft and warm touched my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Black hair rustled on my chest. Ja Hyeong-woo gently pushed his tongue in with half-closed eyes. He sucked weakly then released, entwining the two pieces of flesh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ugh…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stimulation spread through my tense body. My fingertips seemed to spark.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body was escaping my control again, but just for today, I was determined.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I won’t make embarrassing sounds.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I told him not to touch me, Ja Hyeong-woo pressed his upper body close while gripping the chair I was sitting in. His tongue tip dug into deeper places. The wet sounds grew louder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Time slowed down, sometimes stopped. And flowed slowly. Ja Hyeong-woo held my lips as if biting them voraciously and sucked inside my mouth repeatedly. The smacking sounds deepened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As befitting a healer, it was funny how he’d let go whenever his dedicated patient was about to suffocate. My side cheek was slightly pressed against his straight nose bridge. Ja Hyeong-woo slightly separated our lips and slowly exhaled a long breath. It showed that he was absorbed in me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, an unfamiliar sensation exploded on my cheek right next to my lips. Ja Hyeong-woo lightly bit my heated cheek with his teeth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shot up, knocking the chair backward. At the loud crash, Ja Hyeong-woo opened his eyes and looked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, the clothing ties Ja Hyeong-woo had been holding almost came undone. He let go of the strings in surprise, belatedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, my chest wasn’t exposed, but I was stunned for a moment too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I shouted sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “30 minutes is up. Get out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Including the earlier conversation time, it wasn’t a lie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tried holding my hand once, then for once acknowledged with a compliant attitude that the yang energy was sufficient.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I drove Ja Hyeong-woo, whose face was full of lingering attachment, out of the room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m the crazy bastard. Damn it…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I needed something to divert my attention. I opened official documents I was planning to read tomorrow through the status window. I quickly moved my eyes around while belatedly rubbing my cheek with my sleeve. Strange heat kept spreading on my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a while, only the sound of typing echoed in the office.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Click. As soon as I entered the last item, I turned off the computer and leaned my spine against the chair back. This roughly finished the morning’s work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  About 40 minutes left until lunch time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You process work fucking fast. Sae-geon hyung lived with dark circles from working overtime every day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho rested his chin on the sofa armrest and looked at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this fast?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since inevitably meeting with Ja Hyeong-woo every night, student council president work has become much more manageable. These days my eyes are bright even in the morning. My limbs have strength so I can easily go up and down the 3rd floor stairs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, it can’t fix my originally born body…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The status window feeds everything to you, so what takes long? Maybe Woo Sae-geon was just bad at work?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How many dispatched from which attribute. Who’s returning. Who didn’t return. Whose parents called with inquiries.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window reports all this automatically, right? So I just sit in the chair, read, and stamp approval.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Feeds it to you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho suddenly sat up and asked back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You have to search the system for everything one by one, right? The status window does that kind of thing? I followed Sae-geon hyung around for a year and never heard of such a thing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no trace of laughter on Sa Ye-ho’s face. So it became a little eerie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Enough to make me point to the status window at my eye level.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /A B-rank gate has been detected in Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do. Matching regular hunters.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even now the status window is commenting and acting like a secretary…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even that night, I kept thinking about the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before, I would have thought this damn status window had gotten a balance patch or something. Like it took pity on me thinking Yoon Sae-geon could handle things well but I’d need help.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But after realizing from that previous incident that the system was watching me, specifically observing my heretical abilities…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you giving me special treatment, or are you laying groundwork to stab me in the back?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only my muttering echoed in the quiet room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No answer came back from the status window. Silence or ignore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then suddenly something appeared on the status window, making me look up startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …It was a teleportation notification.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I felt a presence, I didn’t look that way. Rustle rustle, Ja Hyeong-woo came to stand beside me, his navy blue hwarang robes fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you in a bad mood? Did something happen?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t want to affirm or deny, so I stayed quietly shut up. Ja Hyeong-woo lightly grabbed my left hand that was sticking out from my crossed arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My cold hand gradually warmed with body temperature. It was warm but ticklish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I always have this expression.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. You haven’t been like that when looking at me lately.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes were definitely wonky. Did his mind go crazy and his eyes get weird too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo slowly sat down on the new sofa following me. Before he could attempt trivial small talk, I spoke first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you talk a lot with the status window?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You mean the words that come out after the stick thing appears first in the status window?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Not stick, slash. Don’t tell me you really don’t know—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, Ja Hyeong-woo is computer illiterate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how distant I was from the original protagonist, since he’s the protagonist I could have pumped him for various information, but there was a reason I didn’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo is the protagonist but doesn’t know much about the system… has no interest at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I talk occasionally, maybe a word or two. About once every 1-2 weeks. Seems similar to other successors’ level. But why? Did the status window say something strange?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, if it’s related to Gyeon Gang-hyeon, that’s a different story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s sharp blue eyes became pointed. Meanwhile, he kept trying to sit closer to my side, so I swatted him away with my hand. Then he didn’t come any closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…No. I just feel like that crazy status window bastard is being especially cheeky with me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did it upset you? I’ll—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, stop. Don’t do crazy things.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s scarier when someone who doesn’t know much has action power. I have no idea what he might do, but I felt suddenly ominous and cut him off decisively.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You watched Hae Mi-jun’s training today, right? Did his skills improve more?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to talk about other people…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Never mind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I glared sideways, Ja Hyeong-woo immediately tucked his tail.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For 30 minutes, I usually talk about training. It’s natural since I’m the leader. However, since we’d never been on easy talking terms, conversations still feel choppy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, what’s surprising is that Ja Hyeong-woo doesn’t bring up old stories or mention when I was a delinquent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d rather he talk about boring stuff like how the tree in front of his house got autumn colors today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So it’s unexpected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On one hand, I think he’s considering me without just pushing his own feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, our eye contact grew quietly long. Deep in Ja Hyeong-woo’s pupils turned a dark color.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat with my knees up and leaned against the sofa with a resigned feeling. This would make it uncomfortable for Ja Hyeong-woo who had to lean back to treat me, but I don’t care.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Doesn’t your energy get insufficient doing this every day?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had just quietly complained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ja Hyeong-woo quietly raised the corners of his mouth. That movement was felt by me too through our nearly touching skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we test it? Let’s try it once until I run out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
