 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successors vs First Call, current score 3:1.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the Successors win this 5th set, the match ends immediately. If First Call wins, it goes to a 6th set tomorrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And right now, in the American broadcast screen, it’s the Successors who are in crisis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“21 minutes 42 seconds! First Call has successfully entered the stronghold!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The 5th set has entered the latter half, the capture battle.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two American commentators were originally employees who worked at gate conquest broadcast stations. Since they had volunteered themselves, they handled the commentary smoothly. Like any sports match, their remarks and coverage flowed seamlessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“In the 4th set, the Successors entered the stronghold at 22 minutes 29 seconds, right? About a 1-minute difference!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes, First Call’s record is slightly ahead! This is quite different from yesterday’s death match!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“That’s right. Long-term team battles inevitably have various variables. I think it’s a variable that comes from having both a too-strong hunter and a too-sickly hunter on the Successor team.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni, who had died caught up in Woo Sae-geon’s sword strike, rejoins the stronghold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His gun barrel unfailingly points toward the frail archer fluttering in white clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Right now the Successor team can’t take care of Gyeon. Gyeon keeps repeating the cycle of being eliminated, coming out from the respawn location, and being eliminated again.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You could say Gyeon is doing his part by keeping Agni occupied. The problem is that the remaining Successor team overall can’t focus. It seems like their calls aren’t matching because they’re looking out for Gyeon?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While giving heal to Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Ja Hyeong-woo’s heal calculation gets momentarily tangled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like a butterfly effect, an aftermath occurs. Ma Cheon-ah dies to Clyte by a narrow margin. First Call’s focus concentrates on Sa Ye-ho, putting Sa Ye-ho in crisis. Fortunately, Woo Sae-geon beats them all back and overcomes the danger, but Gyeon Gang-hyeon, caught up in the earthquake that Buster caused, adds yet another death to the Successor team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I found out that Gyeon’s thin white clothes are also worn as mourning clothes in Korea? They’re also famous as clothes that ghosts wear.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Oh, I just thought they looked good on him because they’re white and soft-looking, but there was that meaning? He probably wore them knowing that meaning… right?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Quite black humor. But right now it’s not looking very good.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The Successors need one big reversal.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for Agni occasionally breaking away because he’s gotten a taste for killing Gyeon Gang-hyeon, First Call was completely united as one. Since they all had momentum, they didn’t die easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stronghold gauge works by going up when the number of defending team members in the stronghold is fewer than the attacking team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the four excluding Woo Sae-geon were taken down one by one by First Call’s full offensive, even though Woo Sae-geon was standing perfectly fine, the gauge was being steadily stolen right before their eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This set is really unpredictable. Will First Call really be able to conquer Woo? By taking down his limbs—his teammates—rather than his head?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The capture gauge is already at 86 percent! If they’re not careful, it could reach 100 in just two more close battles! Successors, this is dangerous!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even if the Successors give up 1 point this time, the next set is the Successors’ attacking turn! But you never know. First Call might find a way! Ah, something’s happening as I say this!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tense balance collapsed as the healer Ja Hyeong-woo collided with Buster while moving and lost blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two commentators were focused on covering Ja Hyeong-woo’s surroundings, so they missed what happened off-screen at that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon making eye contact with his teammates and sending some kind of hand signal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The eyes of leader Woo Sae-geon and Gyeon Gang-hyeon met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon was actually displeased. About listening to the strategy that Gyeon Gang-hyeon was proposing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  About the Twelve Zodiac’s troublemaker acting like a ‘leader’ while his eyes momentarily showed extraordinary charisma.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But a crisis was a crisis. He decided to follow Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s strategy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon threw his sword like a spear at Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Gyeon Gang-hyeon closed his eyes tightly and accepted the first step of the strategy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Woo Sae-geon ▷ Gyeon Gang-hyeon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Woo Sae-geon ▷ Woo Sae-geon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Wait, what just happened?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Woo stabbed Gyeon, his teammate, and killed himself too. When every second counts right now!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It doesn’t make sense to say it’s to restore health by dying or to reorganize respawn?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The gauge is going up again. 89, 90! It’s passed 90!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite the precarious situation, the remaining three Successors didn’t waver. Like when they pushed the cargo earlier, the three joined forces and struggled to hold out without being wiped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This means Woo Sae-geon’s sudden action was part of a plan they had made.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Could it be that Woo and Gyeon are hiding at the respawn location with something to do?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shortly after, Woo Sae-geon burst out from the respawn location and joined the stronghold. Gyeon Gang-hyeon was nowhere to be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From behind the corner where the respawn location was, an arrow shoots out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What is that? Something unbelievable has happened!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The arrow that appeared to be shot by Gyeon Gang-hyeon chased after Buster as if it were alive and hit him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buster’s body swayed greatly. Beep—! His health bar shook. The color of his remaining health was bright red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had made First Call’s defender half-health with just one arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Did Gyeon’s arrow have a homing function?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This is the first time. He hasn’t done that until now! He’s been hiding his skill all this time!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I don’t know if this violates the match rules! Looking at the power, it seems like an intermediate skill, no, an advanced skill!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All of First Call, having grasped the situation, show confused faces toward the air. They’re protesting with their expressions. Saying that the situation needs to be clarified.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Game system connected. Let’s see… Oh my, is this true?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And a truth that would be devastating for First Call is revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gyeon did not violate regulations! That’s said to be a basic attack! But I also don’t understand…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The arrows don’t stop and continue raining down. Whoosh! The arrow that shot up into the sky making an intense wind sound eventually plunges down like a fighter jet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Gyeon Gang-hyeon ▷ Bootsman]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Gyeon Gang-hyeon ▷ Buster]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Holy shit!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the broadcast crew exclaimed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a situation that seemed almost terrifying, Quiche, who became the next target, made a dramatic decision. Instead of honestly blocking the arrow, he created a curved barrier with vines to deflect it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The arrow that went off course continued flying with a piercing sound, then thunk!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon stopped the arrow with his bare hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Woo caught the arrow! It flew right into his hand as if it were predetermined! The performance couldn’t be better!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the arrow stopped, coincidentally the arrow’s weapon information appeared on the commentators’ screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“My goodness… the secret has been solved.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The creator of the arrow that Gyeon Gang-hyeon shot, that weapon with sharp force, was Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had deliberately died with Woo Sae-geon and received arrows that Woo Sae-geon crafted on the spot at the respawn location.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was possible because Woo Sae-geon was also a master of weapon crafting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Gyeon Gang-hyeon ▷ Quiche]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it had been another Successor, even with Woo Sae-geon’s arrows, they would only have been able to display their own abilities as the user.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Gyeon Gang-hyeon completely copied even Woo Sae-geon’s power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gyeon has an affinity ability that resonates with others’ energy! The power that brought him up to Korea’s 3rd place! He shows it here! Why I’m qualified!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The broadcast screen that finally located Gyeon Gang-hyeon shows Gyeon Gang-hyeon standing almost across the respawn location.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His confident smile. His fine hair lightly fluttering and pure white clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, he looked incredibly protagonist-like.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“That earth energy is Gyeon’s! But it’s also Woo’s! That’s why he can produce such power!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Wasn’t it that all of Woo’s attribute skills were restricted from the 4th set for balance adjustment? Gyeon twisted exactly that point to present a famous scene!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You say it’s cunning? How about Agni then? Hahaha, Gyeon just utilized what he had to the maximum! To put it bluntly, Agni tormented him a lot!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“His specialness! Amazing!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The defending team crawled up from the cliff’s edge and bit First Call’s ankles. First Call’s remaining members, Clyte and Agni, absolutely had to eliminate Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the Successor team wouldn’t just stand still.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stabbed his own neck with a sword. To move to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s vicinity faster than anyone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Look at that powerful guardian! There’s absolutely no way to kill Gyeon!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Gyeon Gang-hyeon spotted Agni, who had hesitated due to the healer’s presence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just within arrow range.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The exhilaration that took over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s entire body, thinking ‘it seems like it’ll work somehow,’ urged him on. Gyeon Gang-hyeon had no intention of betraying or just passing over the heated atmosphere focused on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He shot immediately upon nocking the arrow to the string.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instinctively, Agni also raised his gun barrel. Bang…! The gunshot created a blank space in the area, unrealistically slow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The straight-flying arrowhead and the spinning bullet grew closer as if being sucked toward each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crack! The arrow pierced through and shattered the bullet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The creator of that arrow that brought down Agni in the moment of final victory was Gyeon Gang-hyeon himself.
 </span>
