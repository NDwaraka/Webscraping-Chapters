  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 114
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon should meet other people besides me, that would be beneficial for his life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much I tell him, it would be useless. Jin Seol-woon wouldn’t think of hanging out with other successors unless it’s me, who he’s coincidentally gotten involved with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Communities are communities, but I’m curious about Gang-hyeon-ssi’s opinion. Who do you think should be the next leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next leader? Is that even a question? Obviously, whether I think about what was in the original work or judge by objective skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It can only be Ja Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d been thinking about it all along, but this was the first time I’d said it out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To think they’re already talking about deciding the next leader. That much shows the story has progressed quite a bit, and I can feel that major changes at the school are not far off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo will have a hard time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The anxiety inside and outside the school that comes from Woo Sae-geon’s retirement. Having to fill the lacking successor combat power with his own debuff abilities, and although Sa Ye-ho, who’s bright in this area since he’s a business major, will help, there are suddenly association documents he has to be responsible for. There’s probably a ton of things that would be tiring just to think about. Ja Hyeong-woo hates even reading status windows in the first place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original Ja Hyeong-woo crossed my mind. I also remember the description of dark circles that had appeared when he collapsed from overwork before taking up permanent residence around his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I don’t want to, but I could help if necessary. At least in areas like solving association villains.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit, but wait, the next administration is Ja Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, the back of my neck feels cold. I can sense the ominous signs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo will be above me from now on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I didn’t think about power going to that bastard! Isn’t he going to repay what he’s suffered from me with tyranny?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was like that, Jin Seol-woon observed me intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you dislike the current leader, or do you dislike Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you doing this to me? Don’t use words, use fists instead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Jin Seol-woon raised his left fist. This crazy bastard?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thrust his fist right up to my forehead, then stopped. Flick, a finger flick hit my forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I scrunched my face so much my eyes nearly closed, then belatedly became serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing? You’re crossing the line?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon chuckled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard couldn’t even apologize properly. When I pretended to get up in annoyance, only then did he grab my arm. I ended up sitting back down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How does Gang-hyeon-ssi feel about becoming the leader himself?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is this bastard serious?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was so dumbfounded that no retort came out. Ha, I just let out an empty breath and lightly kicked Jin Seol-woon’s leg with my foot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you crazy? Hey, do you want to see me completely fuck everything up? Don’t say such ominous things even as a joke.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why not? I think Gang-hyeon-ssi is capable.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to kick him again, but Jin Seol-woon bent his waist slightly and lightly caught my ankle. Then he tilted his upper body diagonally and made eye contact with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the closer distance, a faint cologne scent came from Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi’s eyes are special. You can see both monsters and attributes. How accurate would it be if someone like that gave battle orders.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, even if you have the ability, if you can’t use it—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can use it. You’ve been using it all along.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s pupils, black like the night sky with what seemed like a single star floating in them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop pretending you can’t.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who muttered even the last words, shut his mouth tightly and stared at me. As if watching for my reaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This informal speech…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I couldn’t glare at him in time, and my face went blank first at the thought that suddenly occurred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had said something similar before. That I could do it. That I could sing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then, Jin Seol-woon had said it as an idol. Those were words he’d said to drag me into his main base, music recording.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now is different from then. Now Jin Seol-woon, who has become a successor, repeatedly tells me. That I can do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That it’s okay for me to be someone who saves the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …However, at that moment when I was driven into the sensation of my whole body floating up into the sky, my heart became calm instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rolled up my sleeve and showed Jin Seol-woon my arm. My white forearm that was consistently skinny, far from having any muscle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wouldn’t you be embarrassed if this body became the leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon stared intently at my bare arm. In that state, I quietly replied.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What would happen to the successor image if a troublemaker became leader? I’m totally against it too. …I don’t have confidence to take responsibility either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared at Jin Seol-woon. It was a kind of warning that I didn’t want him to bring up this topic again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because my firm attitude worked well, Jin Seol-woon shut his mouth. Even until I got up and headed outside the training room, Jin Seol-woon couldn’t call out to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, Woo Sae-geon appeared and I had no choice but to be pushed back into the training room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under Woo Sae-geon’s guidance, the joint training that followed was familiar training. In other words, zoo time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Yang Pyo took 15 minutes of mental cultivation just to summon his sheep familiar, Jin Seol-woon was surrounded by the dragon’s translucent body in 1 second and was stroking its horns.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the opposite side, an ox familiar with menacingly large horns was waiting with a visual that seemed like it would appear in nightmares.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ox familiar taking advantage of its criminal record to play the villain, that is, the monster role, while Jin Seol-woon and Yang Pyo used their familiars to face the monster ox (and Woo Sae-geon) in a self-made tanker simulation training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just slacked off while glancing at Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Our puppy would come in 1 second like a dragon if I called him… Puppy listens better than that guy!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I have a serious special constitution where I get short of breath just from enlarging my familiar’s body. If I joined that battlefield, it was obvious I wouldn’t even be able to collect my bones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll just watch.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I secured time to rest legally like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was about to go to a corner, Woo Sae-geon’s gaze stayed on me for a long, long time. I flinched at how disgusting it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regardless, Woo Sae-geon stared at me like looking at a caterpillar, then spat out an extremely ominous sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s a way to create a more realistic training situation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And 5 minutes later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow… are you really serious?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was kneeling on the floor, tied up tightly with rope. Woo Sae-geon held me down with his foot and steadfastly restrained my arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Help with others’ training and prove your usefulness.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I get what you mean. I understand up to putting me in a prisoner role for rescue simulation, but do you have to tie me up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I turned my head back, I could see Woo Sae-geon holding rope and stepping on my shoulder. His arms holding the rope, and his pupils that somehow seemed to look down on me even though he should be concentrating on tying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt strange. It had been a while since such an unpleasant situation. Yang Pyo and Jin Seol-woon couldn’t even stop it since it was what the leader was doing, and just watched. Jin Seol-woon seemed to have a slight furrow in his brow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon gathered my knees and tied both ankles with the same rope. Compared to what he was doing, his tone was utterly dry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This way you’ll feel more need to rescue him.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll sue for defamation… Argh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who didn’t care what I said, lifted me with one arm like a bag. He walked with big strides and dumped me in the middle of the training ground. Thrown on the floor, I sprawled to the side like a dead fish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Standing tall as if he might just step on me, Woo Sae-geon looked at the two successors he had positioned in the corner one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I tied him tight enough to leave marks. The floor is cold.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The voice coldly muttering from under his hat was eerie even though I knew it was all an act. It was as if the training ground had instantly become a hostage threatening scene. Goosebumps rose under my chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Actually he didn’t tie me that tightly…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, since he’s training the kids, I should play along. I subtly trembled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether my trembling showed well outside my white clothes, the expressions of Yang Pyo and Jin Seol-woon watching me gradually changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The training began.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had entered the giant sheep familiar and unified with it, looked around carefully with cautious eyes. Jin Seol-woon hadn’t mounted his familiar yet. The dragon coiled its long, large body in a circle and glanced this way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ox familiar was snorting like a fighting bull, keeping those two in check.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just by numbers, they had two over there, we had one here. The standard route would be Yang Pyo distracting the ox familiar while Jin Seol-woon penetrated through that gap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet the reason they could only exchange glances without easily rushing in was because of Woo Sae-geon’s presence, standing tall with my body between his feet. Only brainless monsters would be able to charge at Woo Sae-geon standing there holding a wooden sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Woo Sae-geon is serious.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now, Woo Sae-geon had restricted sparring between colleagues. But recently, he lifted that rule, limited to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since once he retires, there will never be a chance to fight together again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He probably intends to squeeze out all his strength in whatever way before then.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when I looked up, due to my position, I couldn’t see Woo Sae-geon’s face, only the hem of his robe and the pants inside it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, Yang Pyo bravely charged at the ox familiar. Boom—! The impact sound spread from the sheep familiar and the training ground echoed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Yang Pyo directly charged at the ox?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t believe it. At the ox he was so afraid of? I naturally thought he’d just dodge appropriately while drawing attention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The surprising thing didn’t end there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tap tap tap! Footstep sounds hit the training ground floor hard. Clang! Then the sound of wooden swords clashing rang out loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s robe fluttered and blocked my vision once before falling, and I opened my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was swinging his wooden sword at Woo Sae-geon with a fierce expression I’d never seen before.
 </span>
