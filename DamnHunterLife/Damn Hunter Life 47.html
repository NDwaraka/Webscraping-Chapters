 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Isn’t this a scam?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I can see him rolling his eyes and thinking hard about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He obediently opened his front door with his own hands, yet every one of Yang Pyo’s movements was full of suspicion. Regardless, I leisurely walked past him inside and admired the unfamiliar house structure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo always thinks ‘Is this right? Is that right?’ but keeps missing the mark every time. That’s why in the original work, even when he was doing well, he sometimes showed sluggish movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His reaction to my proposal to stay by his side all night was the same. He thinks it might be a scam, but he can’t reach the conclusion that it actually is a scam. He just goes “uh, uh” and fumbles around before letting it pass.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This time you really don’t need to be suspicious.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current time is 10:17. Yang Pyo might not know, but it’s time for me to sleep. Therefore, after finishing all my sleep preparations at home, I moved to Yang Pyo’s house with just a pillow tucked under my arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo was also dressed in a t-shirt and shorts that he wore as pajamas. It felt strange for me to face someone who was practically a stranger in our sleepwear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A pajama party. Even until this morning, I never expected I’d be sleeping over.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Didn’t you bring pajamas?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is my pajamas though?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo stopped at the corner of the entrance, then stared intently at the sobok I was wearing, seemingly seriously pondering what difference this had from outdoor clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We don’t need to stay awake together, just being next to each other is enough, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh, yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Good, I don’t need to pull an all-nighter. It’s fortunate that what I need to do tonight isn’t beyond my capabilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can confidently say that pulling an all-nighter with my body is impossible even before trying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You live pretty simply.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s house was about the size of a slightly spacious family home. If this were South Korea, it would be excessive for a 19-year-old male student to live alone, but at Hunter School, the story was different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When we first entered the school, successors were given the authority to luxuriously customize their own homes. That’s why most of us, including me, have two-story hanok houses with gardens as standard, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Only one bathroom too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like a scoundrel, I looked around someone else’s house without the owner’s permission. Yang Pyo followed behind me, awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you live alone, having a vast house is kind of scary. Sounds keep echoing too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Makes sense. Would Won Ha-ri or Hae Mi-jun be scared of being alone too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, I wonder?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the end of the short hallway, I could see a rack with two golf clubs. From what I could see, it was the only expensive item in the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is golf a hobby? He can’t even play it here though. Interested, I stopped abruptly, and Yang Pyo, who was coming from behind, bumped into me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you hiding something weird? Why do you keep following me around? Are you going to follow me into the bathroom too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Yang Pyo step back in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t a guest Yang Pyo needed to entertain, nor was I a friend to laze around playing games with. So after finishing the house tour, all there was to do was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Yang Pyo’s spacious bedroom, we each found our spots and sat silently looking at our phones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides the bed, the bedroom had a comfortable-looking armchair. It was probably furniture Kim Sang-ju had used. Or conversely, something Yang Pyo used.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Yang Pyo first settled into the armchair, I stared at him intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I get the bed?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I changed to new bedding. But if it’s still awkward—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not it, you look cramped in there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine. I’m not going to sleep anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I was with him, he still assumed he wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But they say that having someone nearby reduces seizure-like trembling and negative emotions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rustling, I climbed onto the unfamiliar bed. The blanket was a bit thin but not bad. I could feel Yang Pyo’s gaze resting on my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I fall asleep quickly. Wake me if there’s any problem.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. It’s a bit awkward to say, but please make yourself… comfortable. I’m the one receiving help here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I flopped face-down on the pillow and turned on my phone. Besides the mood light on Yang Pyo’s side, there was now a small light in the room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Yang Pyo had taken my phone, he didn’t delete the recording. I was looking at my phone screen briefly when Yang Pyo suddenly spoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But why now…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned my neck to look back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When our eyes met, Yang Pyo’s eyes widened in surprise. He tried to hastily smooth things over with words like “no, no, it’s nothing,” but I had already heard clearly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why now… why now…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why should I have to hear such words?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why now,” he said. Does he mean I helped too late? But the Kim Sang-ju situation was something I accidentally overheard and ended up helping with, right? The logic doesn’t add up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then another hypothesis occurred to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What if it’s not about the Kim Sang-ju incident, but about “me”?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But why now…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The flow of thoughts in my head retraces a past I didn’t directly experience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo and I had the same earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first meeting of successors, even before the original timeline.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When everyone first met, if Yang Pyo was timid but couldn’t stand being alone… which earth attribute user would he have tried to become friends with?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who held absolute power as a tyrannical leader at the time? Jin Seol-woon, who was burdensome as a celebrity and was in panic from the shock of having to pause his activities?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Only Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The previous Gyeon Gang-hyeon would have accepted Yang Pyo’s approach, eaten meals together, and done everything. Until he failed to awaken, he had quite a cheerful personality.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But many things happened between them, and Gyeon Gang-hyeon chose to isolate himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head felt heavy. I pressed my fist firmly against my lips, which had started trembling from the sense of defeat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This… it seems like Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t my only target for karmic debt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It seems Yang Pyo had grown more attached to Gyeon Gang-hyeon than I thought.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I had become a shameless person who disappointed a younger brother three years my junior, and was now belatedly trying to settle my karmic debt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wanted to look back at Yang Pyo behind me, but on the other hand, I hesitated to do so readily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like Yang Pyo would be making some different expression. Like he would unsettle me once again, just like Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s really nothing. I misspoke. What I was trying to say was…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My silence must have made him anxious. Yang Pyo finally brought out an excuse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why… are you doing this much for me? You, no, hyung…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I organized my facial muscles properly, composed myself, and sharply turned to look at Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I smiled brightly, trying to look as light and thoughtless as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “To escape my rock-bottom image, get recognized as a hunter, and receive pension benefits.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a shameless person, alright.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How’s that, Yang Pyo? Feel a bit less burdened?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Phew…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wildcat monster from the last gate. The scene of the large boss being torn to pieces by Ma Cheon-ah’s sword kept coming to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo tried to scatter his thoughts by playing a golf game on his phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least the situation was better because Gyeon Gang-hyeon had come to sleep over. It was definitely better, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘We are together, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard Kim Sang-ju had a habit of snoring in his sleep. Normally it shouldn’t be pleasant to listen to, but Yang Pyo liked it. The snoring sound made him feel that someone was beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But today’s sudden short-term roommate was too quiet, even too quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He glanced toward the bed from time to time, but could only see blankets bunched up at the foot. This corner on the opposite side of the bed head had too limited a view.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo gradually shifted his chair closer to the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He still couldn’t see well, and couldn’t hear breathing either. Frustrated, he dragged his chair and positioned himself right in front of Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Now it feels like I’m with someone.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He flicked his finger on the screen to hit the golf ball.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ball flying over the green grass seemed to gradually become blurry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The more he swung, somehow instead of getting closer to the hole, it only went to strange places. He made mistakes without realizing it. He hit without looking at wind direction or ground contours…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he suddenly snapped awake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did I just sleep?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo realized he had just dozed off. He couldn’t believe it. So easily…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t a misunderstanding due to wishful thinking about wanting to sleep—it was real. A pleasant drowsiness pressed down on his eyelids. He had struggled so desperately but sleep wouldn’t come, so why now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only thing that had changed was the person beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because of that fucking bastard Kim Sang-ju, and now meeting one different person… I’m really pathetic and pitiful.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had only felt awkward because it had been so long. Surprisingly, that same Gyeon Gang-hyeon was as comfortable as Kim Sang-ju had been when he believed he was a friend.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While closing his eyes, not wanting the drowsiness he’d finally caught to fly away, Yang Pyo tried to deduce the reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because even if I show an unseemly side, I believe that Gyeon Gang-hyeon hyung is more… than me, so it’s okay?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is it because I don’t feel like putting on airs with this hyung?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh… Gyeon Gang-hyeon hyung?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon drowsily lifted his eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His eyes were narrow, drunk with sleep. In that state, he stared intently at Yang Pyo, but seemed unable to distinguish where he was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Reluctantly, Yang Pyo introduced himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m Yang Pyo. Do you remember?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why, what? Gyeon Gang-hyeon asked drowsily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sleepy too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Really? That’s good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice, full of drowsiness, came out a beat late each time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I leave?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. You seem to be sleeping already. I’ll just go to the sofa outside…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what if he was left alone and became wide awake again, with terrible scenes returning?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the sudden assumption covering his mind, Yang Pyo stiffened. He couldn’t quite bring himself to say he’d go to the sofa—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next moment, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who could barely open his eyes, said something as if he had read Yang Pyo’s psychology.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The bed’s big, why don’t you come up too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At dawn, Yang Pyo woke up once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he woke up, he felt like he could fall asleep again. He was grateful that he was still sleepy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His vision returned enough to see his surroundings. Somehow, Yang Pyo was lying face-to-face with the person next to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being stuck on the same bed with someone he wasn’t close to, and a man at that. While he thought it felt strange, he didn’t feel like he should pull away. If it had been a friend, he would have become wide awake and felt nauseous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But this hyung seems kind of cold? Does he have low body temperature?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he was properly covered with blankets, the arm touching his fingertips was cold. Just leaving it alone made him somehow anxious…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, whose reasoning wasn’t quite clear since he was half-asleep, realized that the other person was small enough to fit in his arms and simply embraced him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This way he won’t catch a cold. If this hyung makes a fuss in the morning, I’ll say I don’t know because I did it while sleeping.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to Yang Pyo’s body temperature, the other person gradually warmed up too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By the way, he’s really thin. I can feel his bones. Hardly any muscle. But continuing to touch him feels strange… even though we’re both men, why does it feel strange…? His thoughts became muddled here and there before Yang Pyo soon fell fast asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Yang Pyo doesn’t know the inside story, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s night sweats aren’t a symptom that improves by warming up his surroundings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, his body temperature gave stability to the other person. Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t push him away in his sleep.
 </span>
</p>
