<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Heavy snow fell outside the training ground. It’s a quiet, nice scene, but my phone has been ringing since earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why are there phone calls from morning?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I continue the 30-minute treatment per day. And today’s portion is strictly finished.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Ja Hyeong-woo has no right to call at other times and hover around talking about trivial things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“If it weren’t for training, I would have watched the snow with you.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Let’s watch together through the window at home. You can’t catch a cold.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll be alone at home—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, Beom I-ryeong appeared before my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, hang up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong, who approached quickly, said the VR simulation was over and came to me, holding out a score sheet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I read it briefly and clicked my tongue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re really naturally gifted.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s 15 years old, a kid who hasn’t even been awakened for two weeks. Yet he’s showing adaptability as if he’d been training for months.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, even Woo Sae-geon probably wasn’t this good. Beom I-ryeong was a genius.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re okay with it, I’m thinking of setting up a D-rank gate practice. Want to try? If you do it now, you’ll be the youngest record holder.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong nodded obediently as if his own thoughts didn’t matter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please come with me, hyung-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he set one condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eyes too clear for a child stared at me for a long time. I agreed without difficulty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright. I’ll be your instructor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not just because Beom I-ryeong follows only me that I decided to accompany him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Recently, I also try not to leave Beom I-ryeong alone with other successors. The exception would be Myo Cho-hui at most. Even with Myo Cho-hui, I let her see him briefly then quickly bring him back to stay with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before going to the D-rank gate, Beom I-ryeong sat at my house’s dining table and maintained his weapons—a spear and bow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I only want to handle the bow.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you. Your physical abilities are too good to waste on just archery.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong had exceptional stat efficiency that increased just from basic physical training. You could call him naturally gifted with muscles that developed well even with the same exercise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I only shoot arrows because my body can’t keep up. It’s a waste for you to do that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He has a body that’s perfectly opposite to mine. The joke was a bonus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Then you should just abandon that body.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What? I turned around and asked, but Beom I-ryeong didn’t answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Ja Hyeong-woo heard that Gyeon Gang-hyeon was going to assist Beom I-ryeong’s gate practice, he came running.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He would have destroyed that D-rank gate preemptively if he could, but he had absolutely no intention of letting Gyeon Gang-hyeon go to a gate ‘alone.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he rushed to the place, Beom I-ryeong was there. Beom I-ryeong was gripping Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s hand and looking up at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With expectant eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You two are going together?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s steps gradually slowed. He stopped and listened to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm, no. I’m not entirely reliable, so I’ll take a healer along.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s visible even from here. Beom I-ryeong’s complexion instantly turning bad.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The small face slowly turned. Beom I-ryeong’s eyes swept over the large man who could probably crush someone his small size in one go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blatantly revealed hostility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo recalled people around Gyeon Gang-hyeon one by one, building foundation for his thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Me or Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We had the same impure hearts. Therefore, we saw each other as eyesores, but didn’t touch each other. Either way, we were both allies helpful to Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri or Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They also followed Gang-hyeon. In this case, it was admiration and attachment. They burden Gang-hyeon with responsibility, but simultaneously these people also give something back to Gang-hyeon, so it’s a mutually beneficial relationship.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Beom I-ryeong…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throughout the gate practice, Ja Hyeong-woo watched Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was so focused on Beom I-ryeong that he didn’t spare him a single glance. Along with Beom I-ryeong, who stubbornly held Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t see any emotions from Beom I-ryeong.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He just mechanically, as if he must do so, blatantly follows only Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had an ominous premonition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If left like this, he seemed like he would grow in the wrong direction and bind Gang-hyeon to take him away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, it’s also true that Beom I-ryeong is a ‘Tiger’ successor recognized by the system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After returning from the gate, Ja Hyeong-woo was lost in deep thought all day. Even until bedtime after finishing his daily routine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sharp suspicion soon collided with fundamental concepts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What is this thing called the system? Can we trust what the system says in the first place?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It might be that he’s taking a defensive attitude because he’s not good with computers and other electronic devices. But this thing called the system… isn’t it somewhat different from ordinary computers?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s closer to being an entity rather than a tool—can we completely trust such a thing?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How can we guarantee it won’t commit evil acts or be used as a means for evil?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly thought he should go to Gyeon Gang-hyeon. This time, whether he got severely cursed at or hit with an arrow, he felt he could only be at ease after confirming Gang-hyeon was sleeping well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He raised his body from the bed. He planned to go directly to Gyeon Gang-hyeon wearing just a simple durumagi over his t-shirt and pants. He crossed the room and reached for the hanger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, a strange tinnitus burrowed into his ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An eerie tension coagulated in the stagnant air of the room. Ja Hyeong-woo stopped moving. Someone was standing behind his stiffly frozen body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the sticky airflow that seemed touchable by texture, Ja Hyeong-woo picked out chilling murderous intent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Who is it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before being Hunter School, this place is a different dimension not defined by Earth’s rules—inside a gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As a healer, he couldn’t guarantee whether he could prevent something from trying to kill him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Disappear from beside Cheon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A clear voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he sensed danger, Ja Hyeong-woo immediately used his power. Blue light protected his vital points—heart and neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A cold spear tip precisely stabbed the spot outside the blue light, beside his ribs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t surprised. He had already half-predicted the opponent would come at him like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, when the spear stabbed deep, his arm instantly lost agility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensation of metal penetrating his body was too vivid. Pain that was hard for even him to endure tore through his left side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo gripped the spear shaft tightly while enduring the pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He planned to break the shaft to separate himself from the spear handle the opponent held. However, the spear didn’t break even with his strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A weapon, and S-grade at that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A weapon created by a newly awakened successor who had mastered even weapon crafting with extraordinary growth speed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The opponent possessed even greater monstrous strength. Beom I-ryeong twisted the spear while it was embedded. The sound of something cracking spread from inside his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Urgh—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Terrible pain that could make him lose consciousness struck. His knees felt like they’d buckle at any moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Request for backup…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t even know how to get through this crisis, maintaining only the vivid will to endure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His judgment remained unclouded. Therefore, he didn’t move the advanced heal he’d activated for his heart and neck to his injury site.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because that’s exactly what the opponent wanted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If his heart or nape became unprotected, the opponent would immediately target those spots.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo gritted his teeth and looked down at the spear that had stabbed him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong took out another spear from his inventory. With a cruel smile, he tried to skewer the large prey with plenty of places to stab once more with his spear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Woof!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If a translucent brown animal hadn’t burst out from the doorway, that attempt probably would have succeeded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar bit into Beom I-ryeong’s arm with sharp teeth and held on. The teeth were imbued with strong earth attribute skills. Beom I-ryeong’s arm was instantly stained with blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thwack!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Simultaneously with a pure white figure appearing in the doorway, an arrow barely grazed Ja Hyeong-woo’s body and pierced through Beom I-ryeong’s neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huff, ha. This fucking bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon nocked another arrow to his bowstring. The arrowhead aimed at Beom I-ryeong’s neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strength left Ja Hyeong-woo’s legs. Even though the spear was still vertically embedded in his side, he suddenly felt the pain lessening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knelt with a thud. Ja Hyeong-woo, who barely avoided collapsing, pulled out the spear with his freed hand and began treatment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar immediately returned to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s side once Ja Hyeong-woo escaped from Beom I-ryeong’s hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, you… move to the 1st floor bedroom from now on.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To grumble about being out of breath just from the 2nd floor stairs while fighting Beom I-ryeong on equal terms. Ja Hyeong-woo knew it didn’t fit the situation, but somehow he felt like laughing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then should we just live in the same house? So this kind of thing doesn’t happen again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just shut your mouth. Is this the time to talk back?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong looked at Gyeon Gang-hyeon nonchalantly even with an arrow embedded in him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wood attribute’s characteristic vitality. Though he couldn’t heal his body since he wasn’t a healer, he had the skill to distance himself from death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re late. I came slowly on purpose so you’d chase after me. I almost killed this person while waiting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon snorted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, that guy doesn’t die from a little stabbing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was rather relieved by those words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he was hurt from being stabbed or not, even if Gang-hyeon didn’t care, he was okay. It would have been harder if Gang-hyeon had collapsed from seeing his blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But with Beom I-ryeong’s next words, he felt distant again as if driven to a cliff’s edge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “His heart is pounding wildly but only his mouth is alive.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon stared at Beom I-ryeong without any reaction. The empowered arrow shaft vibrated considerably.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A hole was punched through Ja Hyeong-woo’s heart as he watched this. The brief relief he’d felt dried up mercilessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He remembered what Gyeon Gang-hyeon had said while dying in his arms underground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll save you even if I have to trade myself for it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even hearing such words from Gang-hyeon, he wasn’t moved at all. Rather, he was scared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo felt fear now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
