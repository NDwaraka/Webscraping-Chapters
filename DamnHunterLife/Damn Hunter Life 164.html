 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo hastily set down the porridge tray, making a clattering sound. Without even knowing what was wrong, Ja Hyeong-woo thoughtlessly reached out his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I subtly avoided that hand. To divert Ja Hyeong-woo’s attention, I pointed at my phone that was lying face down. Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand picked up my phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why…… no, what is this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I even started thinking things like ‘Did I possess someone again?’ Is this a new world where Gyeon Gang-hyeon isn’t a delinquent?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or could it be—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did the stage broadcast air? Is that why? Ah, but they said they wouldn’t make it public……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had checked the phone screen, made an ambiguous expression where you couldn’t tell if he was smiling or frowning. At least he seemed to understand what the situation was about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was planning to explain later, worried that you might panic like this and your health would worsen.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What is it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was in such a state of panic, as if I’d been thrown naked in front of all the people in the country. To the point where I thought it would be better to be cursed at.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know what kind of face I was making, but Ja Hyeong-woo, who was looking at me, kept twitching at the corners of his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he wants to laugh, he should just laugh. I don’t know why his eyes are opening like that. I’m not in pain anymore. The guy in front of me took devoted care of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your manager talked about you. When you were unconscious.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo sat down beside me, but even though I was craning my neck to listen, he didn’t give any more explanation than that. He just pushed the porridge tray toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Is that the end of the explanation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ended up urging him first. It was after I had snatched away the spoon Ja Hyeong-woo was trying to feed me with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know about when I was sick and dozing off, but now I’m going to eat with my own hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes looking at me, there was an emotion that was difficult for me to accept.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If I tell you what the manager said while looking at you, I think I’ll cry again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart sank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That dawn atmosphere before the lights came on came to mind again. Because of that, I became flustered for no reason. I tried to hide by lowering my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the voice didn’t stop and seeped into my ribcage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I think I’ll hug you tight, can you bear with it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t bring myself to lift my head. I didn’t have the confidence to see the face of the guy who was probably grinning. More precisely, I didn’t have the confidence to control my own expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All these emotions were really unfamiliar and awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Bear, bearing with it is bearing with it, but.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as I mumbled in response, my head went blank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How do such words come out of my mouth? No, how do I even think of such words?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly moved closer inside the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he leaned his thick torso and embraced me. The porridge tray was quickly moved aside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sudden embrace had depth, as if Ja Hyeong-woo was entering into my chest. A surprised breath naturally leaked from my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What…… what are you doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said you’d bear with it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……That was supposed to be when you answer my question. I bit my molars and shot back coldly, but all that returned was a low chuckle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I feel like I’ve been tricked again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo soon separated his chest and looked at my face. I almost unconsciously followed the rapidly departing warmth but barely managed to stop myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, he didn’t directly tell me what Manager Park Yoon-seok had said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you want to look at the internet, you can. There were only good things said about you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That…… I just won’t look.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I shook my head in disgust, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes became strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I had to find something similar…… it was like the eyes of someone seeing a small puppy toddling across the street. As if feeling sorry for the puppy because it’s small, while inevitably becoming pleased by its adorable appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I moved the porridge tray onto my lap. I put spoonfuls of porridge in my mouth at regular intervals. Naturally, silence came over us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get out. Leave me alone for a bit now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo added that I should call if I needed anything and left the room. It’s my house too, but anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after the door closed could I finally breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to be alone to have dark thoughts. I kept mulling over Ja Hyeong-woo’s behavior.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does he really think I wouldn’t know? No matter how much he smiles and acts like that in front of me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That his insides are deeply wounded and festering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t taste the porridge at all. I just sighed with a heavy heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like what I had been constantly worrying about had happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Manager Park Yoon-seok is someone who knows more about Gyeon Gang-hyeon than I do. Moreover, he had been pitying Gyeon Gang-hyeon all along.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After preparing my mind, I opened any news article. I checked what story Park Yoon-seok had revealed without my consent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Seven years of battling illness. A disease inherited from his mother. His mother also died from the same disease.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……I knew about it. Because Park Yoon-seok had mentioned it once before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now, that uncle Park Yoon-seok had blown it up, saying he would stop the critical public opinion surrounding me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who threw his body to protect his colleagues and tried not to reveal it to the world by abolishing the broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who failed to awaken and had been living unable to die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, whose life before that was nothing but tragic…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The timing was excellent. Park Yoon-seok forced the interview while I was unconscious. Thanks to that, all of South Korea fell into shock and despair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, it’s true that I was sick. It’s also true that it was difficult, but I am.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My thoughts weren’t organizing well. I irritably ate the innocent porridge and held my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Most of the things he went through weren’t me. That was the original Gang-hyeon who was sick…… and this is something the original Gang-hyeon should receive.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can only think that I stole what belonged to Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And I didn’t even want this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tapped my phone irritably. I considered deleting the internet app.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than feeling relieved by this situation, I wanted to scream at people, “You crazy bastards, mind your own business!” and create a personality controversy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I recover a bit more energy, I should at least verbally beat up Park Yoon-seok. Who asked you to do this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because of you, ……Ja Hyeong-woo found out.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won’t Ja Hyeong-woo feel betrayed by me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, if it’s Ja Hyeong-woo, he’ll probably blame himself the most.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While manipulating my phone after a long time, I even reached some suspicious link that Sa Ye-ho had sent me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Ta-da]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Watch it and give me your thoughts~]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It looked like some video. It probably wasn’t spam or personal information hacking. I clicked the link.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I encountered a really bizarre video.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The successors’ first self-produced content……?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The video showed each successor in different locations. They were all commonly talking about someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t close my mouth and eavesdropped on them talking about me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon hyung is really a wonderful person. If it weren’t for Gang-hyeon hyung, the current me wouldn’t exist either. Now, I hope Gang-hyeon hyung takes better care of himself.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun prayed for my peace without crying, being brave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Good work, Gang-hyeon. Thank you for becoming a member of our group.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s clear voice sent a slight chill down my spine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Yang Pyo (Sheep Successor): If I had known a year ago, I would have treated him better. I regret thinking it was shameful that he couldn’t awaken.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ma Cheon-ah (Horse Successor): Just looking at our current leader made me burn with competitive spirit. But, admitting it now…… it seems like I never actually won even once. You can keep beating me. But just try getting hurt again.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Won Ha-ri (New Successor): I’ll work harder. So that Gang-hyeon oppa doesn’t get hurt anymore. I want to become a stronger person.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next, facial features so perfect they seemed too honorable to be captured on camera appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon-ssi created the opportunity for me to start singing again. He said he’d cause chaos if I didn’t sing, and I didn’t have the confidence to handle that.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon with a wonderful smile at the corners of his mouth soon put strength into his voice. His voice had a gravitational pull that drew people in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Now I understand that person. Because he’s someone who has risen from frustration himself, he was able to guide me too.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Sa Ye-ho (Snake Successor): Somehow he never talked about old times…… Even with this, are you still an inconsiderate delinquent? Please live with some self-awareness.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Woo Sae-geon (Former Ox Successor): ……Even if I had known about Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s past earlier, the next leader would have been Gyeon Gang-hyeon. The decision wouldn’t change.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was really surprised when even Yoon Sae-geon appeared. He was comfortably wearing his hair down, in a tattoo shop apron with his tattoos mosaicked out. Did Sa Ye-ho persuade him to appear just once?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, when my eyes met with Ja Hyeong-woo’s, I pressed my lips together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That voice was particularly clear. It pierced deep into me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon is…… the only person in my life. I hope that neither his body nor his heart will hurt ever again.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After being dazed for a while, I replied to Sa Ye-ho’s text.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Aren’t you all embarrassed as a group?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threw my phone to the side and flopped down on the bed. Even with my eyes closed, the video lingered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Doing things I didn’t even ask for. Stupid guys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……Smart guys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With this one video, they covered up the protests about the stage broadcast cancellation that had been flying toward me. Not only did they soothe people’s disappointment in one shot, but they also fanned the flames of the topic that arose from Park Yoon-seok’s interview.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some were calm, some were emotional.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the fact that they were all sincere was the same.
