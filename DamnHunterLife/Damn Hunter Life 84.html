</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right when The Heroes episode 9 filming had just ended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Leader Woo Sae-geon sat at his desk, reviewing external documents for 10 successors by himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While pressing his tired eyes, he discovered a title quite different from the others among the papers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;○○ Planning Proposal&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To Woo Sae-geon, this meant ‘unnecessary thing’ in other words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A proposal requesting cooperation for external product development using successors as material. Since it had nothing to do with gates or citizen safety, it was worthless to him, so he just needed to curse out the company that sent it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, this proposal was about to disappear into the trash like any other content proposal…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Woo Sae-geon checked the company name that sent the proposal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, struck by some whim, he read through the contents… and surprisingly, instead of throwing it away, he set it aside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he called someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes. Leader-nim.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon, come to the front of the office and take your work.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon soon placed the document at the office doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;We propose creating ‘The Heroes’ successors’ original song (cheer song).&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knew the entertainment company that sent the proposal was Jin Seol-woon’s agency.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dozens of minutes later, Jin Seol-woon sat on his home sofa wearing only a bathrobe, flipping through the document.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Just as the company informed me in advance.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had already received hints about this matter through his agency. For some reason, Woo Sae-geon had approved this original song project and completely handed over the authority to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, as long as it didn’t interfere with training and stage conquest, Jin Seol-woon could sing the original song…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he could recruit other successors to join their names to this song.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Rather than singing alone, it would be better to bring in two or more people. Both for marketability and fan service.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon tapped the back of his other hand with his index finger, pondering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, among the 9 successors, no one had professionally learned vocals. This meant Jin Seol-woon would have to compromise with ordinary people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As long as they weren’t tone-deaf. With that as a prerequisite.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Naturally, the side that costs the least.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who was already involved in broadcasting and likely familiar with sound equipment and recording, came to mind first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘One more person…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should one be female vocals? I should ask the composer about this part. Or…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, whoever records the song together must also have a particularly good public image.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the very first cheer song and the successors’ theme song.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For example, someone like Gyeon Gang-hyeon, whose image is shaky and who only started functioning properly too late, would be problematic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the person to exclude first from the candidate list was clearly decided, Jin Seol-woon furrowed his brow and thought this way and that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon he slammed the document down with a thud and stopped all thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He decided to just move as his heart led him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Me&gt;Dog successor: Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, you’re probably sleeping now. When you wake up in the morning, please meet with me. I have something to discuss.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since some guy called me from early morning, I arrived at the training ground a bit early while yawning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was waiting. He told me such an unexpected story that I wondered if this guy had a dream or something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Original song? Really?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, come to think of it, something like that was mentioned in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It just appeared very briefly in passing since it had nothing to do with the protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Ja Hyeong-woo was tone-deaf.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only Ja Hyeong-woo’s useless TMI was mentioned and that was it. Whether the idol successor and broadcast streamer successor recorded a duet cheer song or not wasn’t Ja Hyeong-woo’s concern.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, that was the original Ja Hyeong-woo’s situation, and right before my eyes was a cheer song project laid out plainly. Naturally, questions about the details sprouted vigorously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Woo Sae-geon approved that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hot fan reaction and expanded fandom created by the fierce battles in stages. In such circumstances, it’s not surprising that Jin Seol-woon’s agency would propose creating a successor theme song.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Woo Sae-geon agreeing to it is another matter entirely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Since when did that guy care about fans? Or what, did Sa Ye-ho whine that he wanted to do it?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was in the midst of reasonable suspicion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you beating around the bush?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he disliked me having other thoughts, Jin Seol-woon tapped his finger in front of my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I said I want Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi to sing with me. Are you thinking about it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the empty morning training ground, Jin Seol-woon’s quiet voice echoed slightly as it overlapped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, sitting side by side on the bench, had somehow crossed the boundary that had been drawn straight between us. While leaning his upper body toward me as if overflowing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Song practice, recording. Work that doesn’t require physical activity…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, it’s interesting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For me, who still has attitude controversies brewing, participating in a cheer song project that delivers hopeful messages would definitely benefit my image. Looking far ahead, it would help my life after retirement too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I firmly shook my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to because it’s bothersome. I can’t do that kind of thing because it’s hard. I won’t do it. You do it yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought this left no room for hope. But this guy didn’t back down easily. He lightly grabbed my arm as I tried to get up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he had peered into my pupils.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can sing. I noticed that time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That time? …When we first met?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only time I might have sung in front of Jin Seol-woon… could it be when I hummed Innate’s title song a bit? What could he have noticed from that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No wait, that’s his original song.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then his standards would have been even more demanding.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After thinking that far, Jin Seol-woon’s clear gaze came into view again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My mouth instinctively attempted to evade.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve never learned to sing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your tone is good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m pretty sure in the original work, Sa Ye-ho and he completed it well together without me. There’s no problem with this work even without me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi doesn’t do it, I won’t do it either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But wait, why am I being coerced right now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How old are you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A complaint burst from my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Jin Seol-woon responded rapid-fire as if he’d been waiting for exactly those words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m 20 years old. Still young enough to sing if I want to, and young enough to be a bit selfish since I’m younger than Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This bastard…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After being served back the words I’d said a few months ago, I had nothing to say. I lost this one. He caught me off guard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So will you do it or not?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …There was no other way. I was worried this damn guy would tank the project saying he wouldn’t do it without me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was a few weeks ago, and between school faction fighting issues, hallucination gates, and The Heroes episode 10 filming, the project progressed steadily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Innate’s agency composition team sent the completed song. We listened to the song with Jin Seol-woon and Sa Ye-ho in the talk show studio serving as a temporary practice room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought it would be a cheerful atmosphere since it’s a cheer song, but focusing on successors engaged in fierce combat, it was a song with strong drums and electric accompaniment. I quite liked the strong beat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The lyrics are really simple.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why they’ll resonate well with people.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not saying they’re childish?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s professional.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon professionally led practice, patiently answering whatever objections we two ordinary people, Sa Ye-ho and I, raised.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your company is attaching a vocal trainer for us?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that question, Jin Seol-woon pointed to his chest with his thumb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Living life, you encounter all sorts of things. A person who wouldn’t be left out whether you picked visual idols or talented idols in Korea grabbed someone like me and taught vocal techniques.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho-ssi, that note is right. Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, just a little lower. Follow me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought he’d become a harsh drill instructor once he entered his specialty field, but Jin Seol-woon was surprisingly gentle. He was quite conscientious, not expecting much from ordinary people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, since he was the one who dragged me in when I said I wouldn’t do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt strange. Jin Seol-woon and I dividing parts, and Jin Seol-woon listening in front when I sang.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is it because I keep recognizing that he’s an idol?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, strangely, Jin Seol-woon would suddenly make random comments to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve been receiving training since elementary school.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Personal stories he’d never tell Hunter School people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you want to become an idol since then?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. I thought I had to become one. Haven’t you ever thought that way, Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Me? Why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Never mind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One day, while Sa Ye-ho and I were bickering about whose rhythm was right, Jin Seol-woon was sitting on the sofa with crossed legs, gazing warmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stopped the foot I was about to kick Sa Ye-ho with and turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What, is it amusing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not that… it’s refreshing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon didn’t add any explanation to his words, but those words about it being refreshing lingered long within me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…It was comforting. Being able to recall something forgotten, even briefly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to Jin Seol-woon’s patience, surprisingly the three of us didn’t experience any conflicts. Even in important matters like part distribution.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because among us existed a person who wanted to take as few parts as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yes, that’s me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey… is the ending really me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threw the paper with lyrics and threw a tantrum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s singing from the opposite side of the sofa cut off abruptly, then his usual gentle voice popped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi’s part is already the smallest. You don’t want to do that either?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh, I just want to ride the bus…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ending verse that repeats the last section of the chorus once more. The part that decorates the song’s finale that I absolutely shouldn’t handle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wouldn’t Sa Ye-ho eagerly do it if I gave it to him? Since he’s an attention seeker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it okay for someone like me to handle the ending? Wouldn’t Ye-ho do it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been practicing noisily, suddenly shut his mouth tight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho turning serious was quite frightening. Even Jin Seol-woon slowly turned to look at me. Two pairs of eyes precisely pierced into me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why… why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence flowed. Did I say something I shouldn’t have?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was just staring blankly, Sa Ye-ho was the first to part his stiff lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t put yourself down.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ridiculous words didn’t end there. Even Jin Seol-woon supported Sa Ye-ho’s words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi is also a member of the successors. You’re working hard at combat and training. People are gradually recognizing it too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not lacking being with us.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then realizing the intent behind those words, I belatedly jumped up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, you bastards, it’s not like that! I’m really just burdened by it…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What, are they being generous? The more I mulled it over, the more absurd it became. Curses naturally came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look at these bastards’ narcissism.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s my charm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I make a living off narcissism.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why do these guys match so well?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, annoying. I turned around grumbling. Come to think of it, it seemed like a speech pattern I often used. Then do other people get this annoyed dealing with me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Then I’m doing well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, the problematic ending verse went to Sa Ye-ho. Because Gyeon Gang-hyeon stubbornly insisted he wouldn’t do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And as if truly satisfied with that result, Gyeon Gang-hyeon lightly brushed his shoulders clad in white traditional clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon couldn’t take his eyes off that sight for a long time. It was because of a familiar sense of déjà vu.
 </span>
</p>

  He discovered himself in him. Himself from a few months ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His past self who turned away from his own heart and avoided singing, worried that bad public opinion might arise for Innate, who were like family, and the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who was it that made him come to his senses then?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A young kid just wants to sing, and he can’t even do that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person who was so confident back then, why is he trying to avoid it now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to grab Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s shoulder right away and ask.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When I suggested doing a joint project, shouldn’t you have readily accepted? You should use me to improve Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi’s bad image. Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi is calculating enough to do that and more, or so I thought…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I guess what Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi said back then was sincere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day you first came to my house, you said you didn’t want to cause me harm and that we shouldn’t be together in front of people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was that real too? Really, for my sake?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s gaze turned toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to act carelessly, yet he was someone who disliked causing harm to others and tried to isolate himself alone.
