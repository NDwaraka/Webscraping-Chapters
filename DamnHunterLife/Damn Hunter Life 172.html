  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 172
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk! Arrows struck Beom I-ryeong’s body one after another.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he felt pain or not, Beom I-ryeong’s expression gradually contorted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you? What the hell were you thinking doing this kind of thing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While shooting arrows at the kid he had been keeping by his side and caring for just hours ago, Gang-hyeon was upright and unwavering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I thought something was off.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The process of turning suspicion into evidence wasn’t easy. Beom I-ryeong’s identity and abilities as a successor were certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To Gang-hyeon’s eyes too, he appeared to be a complete Tiger successor. Nevertheless, what led him to suspect Beom I-ryeong and ultimately follow him when he showed suspicious behavior was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Gang-hyeon could also see that Ja Hyeong-woo was watching Beom I-ryeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he suspected again and didn’t cling to what was visible. He saw something else in the innocent boy’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And today. The Beom I-ryeong before his eyes whispers words whose meaning is hard to understand immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung-nim is on this side, the same side as me. Since you’re in the wrong place, you have to suffer with a body that doesn’t even fit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon felt the other’s eyes sweeping over his body. Instinctive rejection flashed through his mind, but he feigned composure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you like that? Having to live by pressing bodies together with this person?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes frosted over as if he had been insulted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, don’t react.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon was relatively calm. It was something he had already experienced once with the Maegu monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Above all, Ja Hyeong-woo was with him now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Saying the exact same thing as the monster.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh—! Another arrow flew. Energy exploded momentarily from the slender body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;When You Die, Everything Becomes Earth (Earth Attribute)&gt; skill is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Part of Beom I-ryeong’s body was crushed. Gang-hyeon’s breathing was more labored than his opponent who took the attack. He barely steadied his gasping breath and interrogated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not human.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong slightly raised the corners of his mouth in a smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You realized too late.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something that could imitate human form and even possess wood attribute to perfectly deceive even Gang-hyeon’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it seemed impossible, there was exactly one possibility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Jangsan Beom.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If boss monsters became able to speak after Gang-hyeon became leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Jangsan Beom should have been suspected too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To think a boss he thought he’d killed would pull something like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he had no choice but to be completely fooled. He had received the identity of a person named Jeong I-ryeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How did you do it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It was easy. I didn’t need to deceive for long anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a monster from inside a stage to come out to the school, there must have been manipulation of the system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And that system had even infiltrated South Korea’s internet. Making the association and government exchange fake information.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo realized once again how incomplete the ‘system’ was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I came to take hyung-nim. Let’s go together.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Where to?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A place ordinary people can’t go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even hearing the blatant invitation, Gang-hyeon’s reaction was minimal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather, it was Ja Hyeong-woo who was shaken. He gripped Gang-hyeon’s arm tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Gang-hyeon and monsters are the same existence?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, it’s not even an ordinary monster. Jangsan Beom was a spirit monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon thought of the same thing. Jangsan Beom belonged to spirits, which meant it could be said to be one of the ghosts that had shown abnormal reactions to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What could the ghosts’ purpose be, could it be related to the status window? In the midst of confusion, he caught one clue from the Jangsan Beom that revealed its true nature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m the same existence. So it’s taking me. Something like that intention?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……What happens to me if I follow?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Information was still insufficient. But even if he threatened and tortured Beom I-ryeong here, there was no way Beom I-ryeong would spill more information. Hadn’t he only slightly frowned after taking all those arrows?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon made his decision. It wasn’t worth dealing with anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A cold smile spread in his eyes looking at his opponent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You really don’t know anything. How good the treatment of body-to-body contact with this guy is.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A powerful advanced skill that would make anyone else collapse after using it once poured down like rain, ignoring even usage limits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;When You Die, Everything Becomes Earth (Earth Attribute)&gt; skill is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;When You Die, Everything Becomes Earth (Earth Attribute)&gt; skill is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;When You Die, Everything Becomes Earth (Earth Attribute)&gt; skill is activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong’s body was torn to shreds and crumbled into earth. Beom I-ryeong’s eyes opened wide as if they would pop out, and even those eyeballs became black earth and crumbled away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stumbling, Ja Hyeong-woo who stood up stepping once with his other foot came to me mouth first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t resist. The tongue tip that urgently swept over my teeth, as soon as I completely opened my mouth for him, entered inside struggling to spread and pressed firmly against the sensitive flesh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did my whole body tremble. My senses were so vague I couldn’t tell if I was in pain or just lacked strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo delivered saliva with his tongue, coating it thickly throughout my mouth. Feeling the dizzy sweet taste, I swallowed everything he gave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With our mouths connected, my body swayed and tilted. Ja Hyeong-woo lifted me up suddenly, then laid me on the bed without stopping the kiss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When my back touched the flat surface, my limbs went limp. A palm wide enough to cover my entire stomach emitted pale blue light as it poured healing skills into me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after my body stabilized enough to properly continue thinking did I gently push away Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest. I separated our lips and spoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Send out emergency contact to the students.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At my words, Ja Hyeong-woo looked into space. Soon he looked at me again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The loudspeaker isn’t working.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Not the loudspeaker. The system is like that because I just brought it down.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Down?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I pulled the circuit breaker. Use your phone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gestured with my chin for him to take the phone from my pants pocket. Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand entered without hesitation. Ugh, I stiffened my thigh a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s Yoon Cha-on’s phone number. If you call him, the water attribute emergency contact network will activate immediately.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s such a thing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There is. I set it up by attribute. Besides Yoon Cha-on, there are numbers labeled ’emergency contact network.’ They all know what to do, so just call once and hang up immediately.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m the one who distrusts the system the most. I’d rather trust the phone system inside gates made with human technology.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is a crisis response measure that’s been passed down since Yoon Sae-geon’s time. The student council president needed at least one means to directly alert students to crises.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why didn’t you tell me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At his admiring gaze, I fidgeted my hands and feet. What would you do knowing? Such words didn’t come out, so I slyly rolled my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m telling you now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo skillfully made contact without stopping treatment. While kissing me, he glanced sideways and pressed the phone buttons firmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, I raised my limp arm and felt around Ja Hyeong-woo’s body. I felt half-dried bloodstains.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine. It’s all healed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When did he flinch at my touch? Ja Hyeong-woo was grinning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Reports that all students were safe came back in 20 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Exhausted, I couldn’t even move and lay limp while texting Sa Ye-ho. Meanwhile, Ja Hyeong-woo came back from washing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I need to inspect the system and figure out what to say about the dead Beom I-ryeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was about to get up, Ja Hyeong-woo firmly stopped me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sleep first and do it when you wake up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he half-embraced me and whispered with a voice that had somehow become gentle while stroking my hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sleep here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s saying he’ll continue yang energy charging while holding me as we sleep…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having no choice but to reluctantly settle into bed, Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly crossed his arms and took off his t-shirt in one motion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, what……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly bronze skin filled my vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I get hot when there’s someone next to me. But I don’t want to sleep apart.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The muscle masses I hadn’t seen in a while but never wanted to see again seemed even bigger than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fierce and massive physique. The dense serratus anterior was like saw teeth. The rectus abdominis was split into about eight sections. The latissimus dorsi extending backward was also monstrously developed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why is your body like this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I subtly averted my eyes. While I was grumbling, Ja Hyeong-woo’s bare arm came under my head. The elastic muscles pressed closely against me with just one layer of clothing between us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is it even hotter……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I was getting hot too. I struggled to fall asleep amid the pounding heartbeat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I woke up at dawn. Ja Hyeong-woo was holding me and sleeping soundly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I carefully loosened and lowered his thick arms. Being cautious, he didn’t wake up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned on my phone with the light at minimum. A small light appeared in the darkness. I entered the phone book.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the block was lifted. The dial tone goes through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s the Leader.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly spoke in case he’d hang up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What kind of mindset makes you call at 3 AM?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since you’re American, I’m doing it according to American time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m in Korea right now…….”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We’d only exchanged one sentence each but Yoon Sae-geon was already pissed. Yoon Sae-geon, whose voice had lowered from waking up, stopped talking and breathed long through his nose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hastily spilled the main point. This time it wasn’t just because I was afraid he’d hang up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Beom I-ryeong wasn’t human. Jangsan Beom…… a boss monster that appeared before, it didn’t die in the stage and used the system to come out to the school next.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In two breaths, Yoon Sae-geon’s voice became clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“So.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We already announced about the new successor. What should we do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“We have to announce the truth again.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then people will……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon thought for a few seconds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What did you do with that bastard?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I killed it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know how else to explain it. My left hand, which I unconsciously looked down at, was trembling slightly. I buried my hand under the blanket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Say it was a strategy to let that monster’s guard down from the beginning. That a false announcement was unavoidable to perfectly deceive it.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was genuinely impressed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “As expected, you have the experience of scamming the entire nation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“……]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could feel Yoon Sae-geon’s irritation in the silence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You do your job. I’ll talk to Sa Ye-ho about this case and move the association.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had tried not to deal with Kim Jae-moon again. Yoon Sae-geon muttered to himself, intended for me to hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon just said he’d handle it first? The person who left without looking back when he retired? I couldn’t believe it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you suddenly being nice? Is it because of my news?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Click. The phone hung up.
 </span>
