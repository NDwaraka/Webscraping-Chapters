  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 72
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, with revitalized eyes, rationally observes dozens of mermaid swarms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even within one attribute, each successor had their own unique characteristics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Yang Pyo’s case, as can be seen right before our eyes—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  THUMP! As Yang Pyo charged forward as if ramming with his body, the overlapping Sheep Familiar also pushed away the mermaids at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Invincible body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Sheep Successor moving as one with the Sheep Familiar can’t even get a scratch from ordinary attacks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s so suitable for taking the lead that he’d be more than worthy of being called a more orthodox tanker than Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, having to fight with such characteristics made him inevitably vulnerable to monster phobia.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since they’re gathered, let’s catch them all!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s twin swords, which moved before Yang Pyo’s shout, began crushing monsters from the east.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also shot arrows here and there. Having experienced it once, I was now familiar with the supporting role from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m a bit anxious without Jin Seol-woon. Though the probability of monsters coming to me is low due to the taunt skill.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, with a swoosh of fabric friction, something like a wall touched my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had stood with his back against mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s convenient to stay close to maintain your heal.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I couldn’t even curse through chat. Because I knew that right now my heart was running fine thanks to Ja Hyeong-woo’s blue light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, while pretending to draw my bowstring, I strongly struck Ja Hyeong-woo’s side with my elbow. Whatever the community says later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going too~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A voice with no sense of weight whatsoever.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho moves. I secretly watched between shots.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been following Woo Sae-geon with his eyes as he dove in first with a joyful expression, disappeared the next moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At a speed hard to follow with the naked eye, his fluttering clothes appeared to flicker and cut off intermittently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Woo Sae-geon was charging forward, slicing through everything in front with his twin swords, Sa Ye-ho was more flexible and smooth, swooshing between the monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kieek…? Sa Ye-ho moved to a position where the mermaids’ surprised sounds couldn’t reach, behind them, and leisurely stopped with a raised corner of his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho hadn’t made any attacks yet. He had no weapons either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he was going to attack, it would be from now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Several iron needles appeared between Sa Ye-ho’s fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whooo… Sa Ye-ho blew breath along the sharp needle tips with his lips as if licking them. Then smoke faintly rose from the needle tips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As he swung his arm in a circle, the hidden weapons THWACK! lodged into the mermaids’ necks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The opponents are monsters, but can they die from such thin weapons? That’s a question a first-time viewer might have.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Sa Ye-ho doesn’t need to worry about such things, nor does he need to throw with enough force to pierce through necks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Breath That Brings Fire Demons (Fire Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once they hit, from that moment on, the monsters’ deaths are decided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  KYAAK! KRUAAK! The mermaids’ screams tore through the air. It was the sound of temperatures hotter than flames traveling along the needle tips, burning the throats of monsters born from water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Water extinguishes fire, but fire that’s too strong conversely devours water. It’s a story that appears in the Five Elements theory too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon deployed him because he judged Sa Ye-ho to be fire that conquers water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A guy who has both genius and attention-seeking…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He really has no sense of propriety, but I can’t say that. He’s skilled while acting like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Monster pieces scattered in all directions, and a nauseating smell rose from the blue bodily fluids sprayed on the floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time it took to clear all the surrounding monsters wasn’t very long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had defeated the last mermaid, suddenly collapsed to his knees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What, when did you get hurt?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing him holding his left arm, it seemed a mermaid’s claw had grazed his arm. Did Ja Hyeong-woo miss it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It hurts…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho rolled up his sleeve with a sad expression. A red scratch could be seen on his solid arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo was a cold healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I saw it earlier but deliberately didn’t treat it. It’s not serious.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s right. If you’re going to save skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The drama king toddled over to Woo Sae-geon and held out his injured arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Blow on it~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of blowing, a cold gaze fell. Sa Ye-ho was grinning, then subtly avoided eye contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I applied cold compress so it doesn’t hurt anymore.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stage wasn’t over yet. The boss monster remained as the final homework.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “One more taunt skill…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had been looking at the deep sea, carefully looked at Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s distance, so it won’t reach.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the taunt skill worked from here, the boss monster would have come up earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then what do we do? Can ranged weapons reach down there? I can’t, at least.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you looking at me? Do you think my arrows will work? Have you heard of refraction?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Sa Ye-ho and I were chattering, Woo Sae-geon silently removed his gat and set it down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he untied the ornamental strings of his dopo and pulled the tied goreum. Leaving only his white jeoksam, he left us with one brief instruction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stay alert.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He jumped into the water holding one sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, should we prepare life tubes?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While saying that, Sa Ye-ho used his snake eyes skill once more to watch whether the diving Woo Sae-geon was okay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the calm water surface began to ripple. Woo Sae-geon showed no signs of coming up yet, but the water spray gradually grew larger, shaking even the ground bit by bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t tell if this is the leader’s taunt skill vibration or the boss coming up…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s the boss.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before Yang Pyo finished speaking, I, who had been watching the water surface, answered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As shadows approached from underwater, Woo Sae-geon first surfaced and exhaled barely disturbed breath. He put his sword in inventory and climbed the cliff without difficulty, taking Sa Ye-ho’s offered hand and setting foot on land.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There wasn’t time for Woo Sae-geon to put his dopo back on. He could be seen preparing for battle while still wet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The boss’s size?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A huge shadow appeared on the water surface as if some submarine was rising—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monster mermaid’s head burst out of the water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This boss was also tremendously large. The scary thing was that this boss monster used both arms like a human.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Its outstretched grip aimed at me in the center. The sunlight was completely blocked and the surroundings darkened for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My eyes widened at the palm filling the sky above my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Yang Pyo’s voice was fast, Yang Pyo would probably deflect it first. If not, Woo Sae-geon would cut off the arm. Sa Ye-ho wouldn’t just stand still either. I hope Ja Hyeong-woo doesn’t step forward. It’s fortunate I kept him at a distance earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I was with skilled people enough to be optimistic, I chose to respond directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Judging from the ‘Grave of the Dead’ skill, my specialty is making the ground sink or rise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Actually, looking at just my characteristics, I’m suited for tanking too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the thought of winning by myself, I straightened my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The notification voice in my head read the name of my second skill as Earth Successor that I had recently obtained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Activating &lt;Lonely Gravedigger (Earth Attribute)&gt;.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This seemed to be a tanker skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The role of pushing back enemies at the front with strong body and courage to protect comrades.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The role of charging at enemies to break their movements and buying time and leisure for comrades.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  GRUMBLE— The ground under my feet rumbled lightly. Following my will, a mountain made of earth shot up as if to pierce the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the mermaid’s hand BANG! collided with the earth wall—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Kugh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shock shook my body. BEEP—! Tinnitus struck my head hard. As much as the mermaid’s hand bounced off the wall, it affected me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, your new skill!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shouts rang out from all directions. I tried to endure, but my knees had already buckled. Honestly, it’s a miracle I didn’t lose consciousness immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m also earth… a tanker.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “All tankers are frozen to death, you bastard!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tasted metallic blood in my mouth. Does tanking once make your insides turn upside down…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s face entered my blurry vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A cool and pleasant sensation hit me. A moan naturally flowed out. Ja Hyeong-woo properly supported me again and skillfully operated his skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was so comfortable I forgot where I was. It felt like immersing my body in perfectly cool temperature water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But did Ja Hyeong-woo’s heal always envelop the whole body like this?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my eyes. First, Ja Hyeong-woo’s pale expression, then the blue glowing water stream surrounding my body in a circle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One of the advanced skills Ja Hyeong-woo would have. Having seen the description in the original work, I could immediately identify what skill it was by seeing the form of the energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Prayer That Draws Up Purifying Water (Water Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a skill that wasn’t listed in the current report.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did it just develop? After seeing me collapse just now…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The difference between having one advanced skill or not was really huge. With this one skill, the current Ja Hyeong-woo instantly surpassed the original Ja Hyeong-woo’s abilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My plan was successful, but somehow the aftertaste is bitter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze pouring over my face was terribly emotional. Full of worry, but on one hand it seemed like relief at my recovery.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was uncomfortable. I got up while avoiding Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other three I’d left behind were enthusiastically beating up the boss monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With Woo Sae-geon’s skills, chatting during combat should be fine. I secretly sent a private chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Ox Successor: We agreed I’d experiment with my skill on the boss monster

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blue blood spurted to both sides of Woo Sae-geon. SLASH, SLASH! He hacked the monster’s arms until blood splattered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, a reply flew over. Is Woo Sae-geon actually two people? I knew this when I sent it, but it was newly amazing that chatting was possible in the middle of that.

  While saying that, he stabbed two swords into the mermaid and brazenly killed it right before my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …It was a good opportunity to push Ja Hyeong-woo further to develop his healing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, since Ja Hyeong-woo gained an advanced skill, today was enough with this. Comforting myself with that regret, I returned to the corridor with the people who had conquered the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was when we entered an area without cameras.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Did you think I wouldn’t know? What thoughts are in your head.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar spoke into my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I could fully understand the meaning, my mind reeled. The moment I intuited something was wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {This is why I can’t help but hate you. Really…}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar wasn’t talking to me, but to someone near me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was possible because…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other party was the Mouse Familiar’s original owner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Master. This guy got hurt on purpose.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stopped abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
