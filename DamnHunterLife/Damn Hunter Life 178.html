  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 178
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While giving the successors vacation, they also gave vacation to regular students, leaving only the minimum reserve personnel. Perhaps because of that, the school felt deserted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s nothing to do.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had been hours since work notifications had stopped ringing for the first time in a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wandered aimlessly around my room with nowhere to go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I play a game for the first time in a while……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Reluctantly, I started up the dusty PlayStation. The graphics of a game I’d left unfinished appeared on the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I moved the game controller for about 10 minutes, then immediately threw it down with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t in the mood to play at all. I couldn’t concentrate either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had been watching me from behind the whole time. He sat quietly like a stone, but when I threw the controller in a fit of irritation, he suddenly approached me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he kept looking at my face without saying anything for a while, I urged him bluntly. Only then did Ja Hyeong-woo open his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tomorrow is my birthday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……I didn’t know. Tension pierced through my body for the first time in a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were the original Gang-hyeon, he would have known Ja Hyeong-woo’s birthday.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wait, if Ja Hyeong-woo’s birthday is in February.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A year ago around this time, it means Gang-hyeon died in his sleep during the month of Ja Hyeong-woo’s birthday.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt melancholy. While I just chewed my lips, Ja Hyeong-woo muttered bland soliloquies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I should have been born later. Since you’re born in December, I’ll retire 10 months before you. Still, it’s fortunate. Now that going out is possible.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t give any particular reaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo moved his knees to sit a little closer. It was only about 20cm away from the cushion I was sitting on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I give you a present?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, my body tingled at his low voice. I grabbed the edge of the cushion with my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there anything you need? You have a lot of store points too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was really such a cheesy thing to say, but my heart thumped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It must be a sense of crisis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to do it with you today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A dark room with just the two of us. The auxiliary light from the TV was no longer visible. The whole world was quiet except for heartbeats and breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked intimately at my cheeks, which must have turned pale. Soon his eyes dropped down pitifully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry. I’m being cunning.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had targeted the moment when I was feeling lonely. He revealed his own greed by exploiting my weakness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good thing you know it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I also couldn’t deny that there was a heart that tried to comfort me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wind in my heart blew from my side toward Ja Hyeong-woo’s side. I had the illusion that Ja Hyeong-woo’s hair was fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I know how much hot body temperature is hidden inside Ja Hyeong-woo’s clothes. That his body heat is so great that it can fill someone like me quite easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Do what you want.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ended up saying words that I didn’t know what kind of effect they would have on my future self.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart dropped so hard at those changing eyes that I even added words that hurt my pride in an unseemly way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since there’s nothing else to do today anyway……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And inwardly I had all sorts of thoughts to myself, whether they were excuses or what. It’s his birthday. Last year on his birthday, the original Gang-hyeon could have died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We’re also facing a big stage ahead, so it would be good to receive yang energy vigorously once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I avoid it today, I can’t shake off this guy for my whole life. ……Isn’t it just a matter of time?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I regretted it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the very beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body was lifted up in an awkward position. Ja Hyeong-woo lifted my waist and the back of my knees with both arms and kissed me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While giving me a deep kiss that poured his head down overwhelmingly, Ja Hyeong-woo moved with thumping sounds. He turned his body and pushed through some door with his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A soft sensation arose on my back. The back of my head hit the bed without hurting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just being placed between the pure white bed and large Ja Hyeong-woo made tremendous anxiety spin my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Trying to buy time somehow, I blocked Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips that were about to overlap again with my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you…… know how to do it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked at me with surprised eyes, then smiled shyly around his eyes and nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then you also know how to do it between men?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My face gradually burned with heat. I really didn’t want to talk about this kind of thing out loud. Because of some fear, I ended up asking Ja Hyeong-woo persistently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo bent his eyes as if even that was enjoyable and turned the question back to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know, Gang-hyeon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That properly left me speechless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. You might not know, but I’ve been thinking like this for a long time. Actually, I’m completely perverted.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sensing that his skin was increasingly boiling with lust, I trembled like a herbivore just before having its throat torn out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does it make sense? I’m supposedly the leader, but lying under a team member like this……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t listen very carefully to my serious anguish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing lying down?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He only persistently induced some words to come out of my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those eyes glistened with black heat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Lying down and spreading legs…… Anyway! How can you do that!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to being pressed down in close contact, I could feel all of Ja Hyeong-woo’s muscles. Thighs that were monstrously thick with writhing tendons, and chest and abs that were too hot and hard even though they weren’t heated metal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I won’t mention the fierce flesh pillar below that already seemed half-erect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s face became thoughtful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I never thought about the opposite…… Then do you want to be on top? I’m fine with either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, I imagined Ja Hyeong-woo moaning under me with that bulk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I imagined it, it seemed like a tremendously wrong scene. If that actually happened, wouldn’t the world end?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I knew what I needed to know. That when two men do that thing, only one person’s cock are used. And the other person has to ‘forcibly’ open a place they would never normally give up and play the role of letting the cock enter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I even knew where that place was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Never mind. I don’t want to spread your ass.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought it might be humiliating, but Ja Hyeong-woo just laughed once and readily accepted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to spread you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment those words dropped, his cock that had been pressed against my groin heavily rose up. It pushed firmly between my legs with one throb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You receive the sexual pleasure I give you better than you think.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t even avoid his eyes, and couldn’t even breathe out loudly. I was afraid that my body was trembling finely and that vibration would be transmitted to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An anxious silence flowed where my toes curled up involuntarily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slightly raised my hand to block in front of Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest, but the next moment elastic muscles pressed firmly against my palm. Ja Hyeong-woo pushed forward with his chest and covered mine with his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had been too tense, so I made a strange sound even at the small contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo put his tongue in and rubbed the inside of my mouth densely. My hand caught between our chests bent to one side. Ja Hyeong-woo’s brutal hands moved me aside and did something in between.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hah, when he exhaled roughly and separated our lips, my upper body felt empty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The clothing ties were completely untied. White clothes were flowing down from my shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Embarrassment flared up and I hunched my shoulders. Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze glared as if to burn my bare skin into his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, this wasn’t the first time showing my body. When I was too sick to even stand up, Ja Hyeong-woo had helped me change clothes several times. He had also assisted with showers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the atmosphere was too different from then and now. Now I wasn’t sick, and the situation was what it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was here to have sexual intercourse with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo lightly kissed my flat stomach. Strange goosebumps rose where he touched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest muscles gradually expanded and his breathing became fierce. My hands trembled with unknown emotions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was too fast, so I instinctively wanted to break the mood a bit. I attempted conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But do you…… like how a man’s body looks like this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Really, I couldn’t even catch a glimpse of abs all year long. All I had was weak pale skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I probably need more fitness than that, but I can’t handle it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. I like it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t satisfied with my body. Since there are unavoidable circumstances, I just give up and focus on survival, but if I could have done it too…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had been thinking I wanted to build my body like Ja Hyeong-woo’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps I have as much jealousy as embarrassment about showing my naked body to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually, if it’s your body, I’d like it no matter how it looked. But among all the good cases, I like this one the most.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I had a different type of body, Ja Hyeong-woo would have said ‘that body’ was the best just the same. What’s important to Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t the appearance of the body but its owner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smooch, smack. Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips rained kisses densely on my not-so-wide stomach. I barely endured the strange sensation sprouting from my skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll get muscles after you retire and exercise.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regardless of the content of his words, when Ja Hyeong-woo buried his lips in my stomach and whispered, I felt like I’d go crazy from the tickling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was swept away by the tingling feeling and couldn’t resist, my legs became chilly. Only when Ja Hyeong-woo’s hands caught the thin fabric did I realize.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thrashed about attempting meaningless evasion. But my bare buttocks were already touching the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The underwear that was stripped off from my ankles was thrown under the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
