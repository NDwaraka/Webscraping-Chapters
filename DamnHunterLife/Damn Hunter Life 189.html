  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 189
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite all that had happened, Han Hyeong-woo continued to visit Cheon Gang-hyeon. He acted as if he had forgotten the wrongs Cheon Gang-hyeon had committed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What happened in the gate…? You almost awakened, didn’t you? Can’t you tell me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He worried about his body and tried to spend time together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon felt a relative sense of deprivation toward Han Hyeong-woo, who didn’t blame him. He felt pathetic. He deteriorated day by day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I shouldn’t have gotten to know a bastard like you. Even just to avoid hearing nagging.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, he became unable to say anything kind. Not only did he shoot harsh words at Han Hyeong-woo, but he also spewed abuse at everyone he encountered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why don’t you get lost? How can you laugh while attending such a shitty school?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fellow successors, all students, and the entire nation cursed his unrestrained attitude. He thought of the criticism directed at him as coming from Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it because he had given up on awakening once? The pain stabbing his body became more severe than before. Cheon Gang-hyeon grew close to alcohol he had never tasted before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For months, he gave Han Hyeong-woo nothing but terrible wounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, cracks appeared in that solid relationship.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It’s your fault that you couldn’t awaken.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo was human too, so he eventually became exhausted. He collapsed under the knife Cheon Gang-hyeon had stabbed him with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you barely have enough time to live properly, why do you only drink? Are you getting alcohol addiction counseling from the administrators?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His way of worrying about Cheon Gang-hyeon, who was destroying his own body, turned into anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of Cheon Gang-hyeon, who couldn’t fulfill his role as a successor at all, he began devoting more than double the time to training as if it were his responsibility, so his free time inevitably decreased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…How many times is this? How many times do I have to say it? Do you know how many times I’ve brought you back after you collapsed from drinking? Why do you say harsh things to the students?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes he got angry, other times he lowered his eyes and tried to soothe him. Han Hyeong-woo was devoted to the very end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not this kind of person. It’s all because of alcohol, right? Should I tie you up? Should I monitor you 24 hours? What should I do for you, huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the feeling of sinking into mud he could never rise from again, Cheon Gang-hyeon returned all of Han Hyeong-woo’s kindness with malice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even committed the outrage of screaming that he would report Han Hyeong-woo to the police as a stalker. Then their relationship quickly fell apart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know that what you say is different every time? You say you want to awaken, but you don’t even try to improve!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He drank alcohol to endure the pain of awakening sickness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pretending he still had lingering attachment to awakening… was because that seemed like the most ugly and pathetic way to appear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon truly did his best.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that Han Hyeong-woo’s illusions about him would be shattered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m disappointed. I didn’t know you were this kind of person.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, when Han Hyeong-woo started calling him a ‘scoundrel’, and when he came to believe that the incident in the gate was ‘Cheon Gang-hyeon making a stupid mistake and missing his awakening’.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I understand. That you don’t think about me at all. I won’t worry about you anymore either. It’s not enough just helping the people you’ve harmed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he declared he wouldn’t cling to worrying about him anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon felt terrible relief and loneliness simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s hard. I just want to let go… I wish I could just sleep like this and die. Should I drink more alcohol?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the bed where he always lay, he fulfilled his life’s last wish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet Cheon Gang-hyeon opened his eyes again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He saw a status window screen before his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I… didn’t die?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More precisely, the status window answered that it had briefly stopped Cheon Gang-hyeon’s time at the moment of death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /These are the things that will happen after you abandon everything and die.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window showed Cheon Gang-hyeon certain scenes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It showed how Han Hyeong-woo, left alone, would live, what work and crises he would face as a successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was probably intended to persuade Cheon Gang-hyeon. It would let him return from death, so this time, accept the role as a special awakened person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /If you die, your soul becomes an existence that triggers chaos. The monsters who want to cross over to this world want you. After death, you might perhaps become Han Hyeong-woo’s greatest trial.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When was it that it said it shouldn’t interfere, and now when persuasion was urgent, it casually revealed even major secrets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t believe that Han Hyeong-woo’s life would become more messed up if he disappeared. It felt like his heart, which should have already stopped beating, was breaking once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I become like the final boss in Han Hyeong-woo’s life? My soul becomes a monster?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo truly wouldn’t let Cheon Gang-hyeon be at peace even after he died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, it made him change his mind. He decided to accept the status window’s deal and return, unable to even die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘For me to stand up without repeating past mistakes.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I must let go of both my inferiority complex and affection toward Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s only possible if my self-hatred disappears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Make me not know that I am myself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had read many fantasy novels while lying in bed. He made a request recalling content commonly found in novels.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Make me think I’m someone else who possessed Cheon Gang-hyeon. Then I’ll be able to move forward.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon gave up being himself. Because of disappointment and disgust with himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Make Han Hyeong-woo find the changed me strange so our relationship naturally becomes distant.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /That’s not something I can do.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite the status window’s answer, Cheon Gang-hyeon stubbornly believed. That it would naturally happen that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Please let Han Hyeong-woo stop caring about me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hope he won’t be held back by me anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Since I’ve given up all memories of myself, let me take information about this future instead. Is that possible?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window answered that it was quite a reasonable trade.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll call this future the original work, and Han Hyeong-woo the original protagonist.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He would be a terribly boring protagonist. Even so, Cheon Gang-hyeon believed without doubt that Han Hyeong-woo was the center of the story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Han Hyeong-woo was the protagonist of his story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he was the only lingering attachment Cheon Gang-hyeon left in life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The protagonist ‘Ja Hyeong-woo’ was a protagonist with excellent heroic spirit despite being rigid. The extra ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon’ was openly trashy scum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was perfect casting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And naturally, Cheon Gang-hyeon forgot even that conversation. Due to the choice he made and the conditions of the deal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s because of you. …No, actually it’s because of me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first, it started to avoid hurting Han Hyeong-woo by saying he was sick. But at some point, everything was ruined.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon gave Han Hyeong-woo the greatest wound by making him hate him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…I must forget everything. Even if it means I don’t have the confidence to live again with these memories.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so to Cheon Gang-hyeon…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To me, a new day came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I woke up in an unfamiliar wooden bed, I moved without hesitation as if I knew what to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The scenes that had rushed into my head when the sphere broke gradually faded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As my vision returned and focused on the scene before my eyes…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A blue boy and a brown boy stood within sight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo’s mouse familiar. And my dog familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I knew the truth. It was strange that I hadn’t recognized those kids earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar, my childhood self, hated me enough to want to kill the current me. And cherished and protected Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Why are you like that to Hyeong-woo? Hyeong-woo is so kind. Why are you being mean and holding him back?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was as if young Cheon Gang-hyeon was questioning me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, the dog familiar, young Han Hyeong-woo, denied the adult Hyeong-woo. And treasured me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {You wanted to meet Hyeon again so much. But you can only do it that way? If Hyeon says he doesn’t want to see you, you should have just disappeared instead!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two familiars liked different masters. So when they were stuck with me and had to stay together, they only growled at each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But on the day I saw those two familiars, who had been fighting like that, embracing and crying while regretting their separation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The locks on my heart were already undone. Both I and Hyeong-woo had accepted each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A year that was short if short, long if long, comes to mind like a panorama.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were only years of constantly raising voices with Hyeong-woo and being dishonest. Because our relationship had grown distant, he couldn’t readily give treatment, so Hyeong-woo secretly committed wrongs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Coming back this long way to meet today, I’m facing Hyeong-woo. In this space of unknown identity. Alone together where no one else can interfere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I closed my eyes tightly. I randomly spat out the knots bundled up inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I hated you. You’re annoying. I hate the sight of you!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once my heart started pouring out, it pounded like a downpour.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why do you stimulate my inferiority complex in front of me? Why do you pity me when I’m sick? I never wanted to see you again! You shouldn’t have been a hunter, you shouldn’t have been a healer!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted so loudly I forgot to breathe. When I took a big breath of air, my throat hurt and choked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My voice was fully soaked with moisture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did you make me… die and come back to life.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I looked up, Hyeong-woo’s eyes were red. He had the exact same expression as when he was young.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head felt so heavy it seemed like it would plunge straight into the ground. I dropped my head with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I regret it. Erasing all those memories. Now I can’t go back to being Cheon Gang-hyeon…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I muttered that far, I suddenly came to my senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did I just say that…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No. That’s not my thought. I didn’t say it. I thought it and spoke it with my mouth, but still.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I am…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The thoughts in my head wandered without reaching an end. I was confused. My head, which had reached a state of panic, spun around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo dropped both knees hard enough to make the ground ring. He lowered his body and knelt in front of me, sitting there in dismay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you think of yourself as Cheon Gang-hyeon, then you’re Hyeon. If you think you’re not, then you’re someone else. You can live however you want.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pitch-black light in his pupils holds me so strongly it seems it will never break.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Either way, you’re truly a wonderful and brave person. To me, and to anyone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tears of an unfamiliarly hot temperature flowed in streams and fell with soft thuds on the back of my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Hyeong-woo’s eyes were so red, he didn’t shed a single tear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only his voice was already sunken as if he had cried his heart out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to say everything is my fault… but I won’t think that way. Because you before death wouldn’t have wanted that…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like my heart was being stabbed with a knife. Listening to Hyeong-woo whisper each word slowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wanted to speak too. This time, I spoke aloud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I, who had been foolish, did what I couldn’t do before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not your fault. But it’s not my fault either. I won’t say it’s my fault.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I blinked my eyelids hard and barely pushed away the tears. Looking straight at him, I returned his words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because you wouldn’t want that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo’s eyes became a little more red with blood. He put strength in his eyes and slowly inhaled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. You did nothing wrong. You just… suffered a lot. I’m sorry. Really, I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now that we’ve safely gotten through the final stage, it will probably take a long time for me to fully accept this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, if there’s a justification to keep me from giving up halfway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I opened my mouth, salty water filled my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to be together. From now on, forever.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, tears flowed down from Hyeong-woo’s eyes. The tears I was shedding transferred to Hyeong-woo’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Hyeong-woo desperately looked at my lips right now, I thought it was a miracle that I could say this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you for bringing me to today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We embraced each other tightly as if we would merge with Hyeong-woo. Although it was a little hard to breathe, I didn’t think at all about loosening the arms that held us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We perfectly finished the stage that threatened the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was the bravest hunter and the greatest hero.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is how it was known on the surface.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, within that story, there was no grand significance or noble will.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was just one person.
 </span>
</p>
