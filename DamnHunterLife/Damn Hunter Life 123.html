  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 123
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  True to being the successor with the best mobility, Sa Ye-ho suddenly disappeared and reappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that brief moment, he had gone and spied on what everyone else was doing. With his bright red hair, he had the worst camouflage in the forest pool, but he managed to get by somehow with his silent footsteps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo is sleeping right now. Want to doodle on his face?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Deal.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What welcome news. Otherwise I would have had to coax Yang Pyo into forcing him to sleep. I drew a line through the ‘doodle on face’ mission in my notebook and crossed it out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also paired up the other missions on the list with the successors one by one. For Hae Mi-jun, who was sitting still and obediently waiting for me, I assigned ‘stick a velcro name tag that says “Cutie Sexy” on his back and don’t get caught for an hour’. For Won Ha-ri, who had already entered the water, I gave the mission ‘throw the clothes you brought to change into in the water’, and so on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A little later, I stealthily approached the hammock where Ja Hyeong-woo was said to be sleeping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From a distance, I could see a huge mass of fabric sagging down particularly taut at the butt area. One leg was sticking out of the hammock, unable to handle his bulk, half hanging over, and the hammock rope tied to the tree was stretched pitifully taut, struggling desperately not to break.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The camera assigned to Ja Hyeong-woo must have been filming only his peacefully closed-eyed face for an hour now. Pure tranquility that wouldn’t even produce 10 seconds of footage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But now I’m going to doodle on him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Trusting only the information I’d seen in the original work that once he falls asleep, he doesn’t wake up easily, I stealthily approached Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Holding a magic marker and looking down at the dark-colored canvas—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes suddenly snapped open as he jerked his upper body up and grabbed my wrist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Ja Hyeong-woo got up, the entire hammock lurched. Suddenly weight was put on my caught wrist and my body collapsed forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to headbutt Ja Hyeong-woo, I desperately turned my head to the side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire hammock tilted to one side. Ja Hyeong-woo put one leg on the ground to stabilize the hammock, then caught me against his chest to stop the series of accidents.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I growled quietly in Ja Hyeong-woo’s ear so the status window cam wouldn’t pick it up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fuck, they absolutely won’t edit this kind of thing out on broadcasts…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put special emphasis on the “fuck.” Reducing my voice so only air came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to get up immediately by gripping the hammock, but it kept swaying so it wasn’t easy. Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been fidgeting, soon slowly lifted me up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Standing on both legs again and awkwardly tousling my hair, I realized I was still holding the magic marker in my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And that Ja Hyeong-woo had already seen the magic marker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wait, it didn’t say to doodle on his face ‘secretly’, did it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, the broadcast team wants me to doodle on your face. Close your eyes and go back to sleep.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I went out brazenly with a straight face. Isn’t a delinquent image for times like this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This works?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shameless audacity really does pay off. Delinquents are the best.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo lay back down and closed his eyes, and I drew mouse whiskers and mouse front teeth on his dark face before coming out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s permanent marker so it won’t come off.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t forget to leave some advice either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, next was Jin Seol-woon’s turn. According to Sa Ye-ho’s intel, Jin Seol-woon was in the pavilion with an acoustic guitar and sheet music, composing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mission I was going to do with Jin Seol-woon was number 6: hearing him say “I like it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had been sitting in the pavilion plucking guitar strings and humming to himself, looked up when he sensed my presence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After giving an oddly formal greeting, he didn’t look back down at his guitar but kept staring at me quietly. As if waiting for my lips to open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried a light lead-in. I pointed at the guitar and sheet music with my finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How’s that going?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Composing? It’s fun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said “fun” instead of “I like it.” I need to make him say “I like it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re good at combat but you really should stick to your main job. A guitar suits you better than a sword. Why didn’t you just make your weapon guitar-shaped? Like a rocker going ‘Yeah!’ and thrashing monsters with a guitar. How does it feel to hold a guitar instead of a sword in front of cameras? How long has it been since you held one publicly?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rambled on with lengthy nonsense while leading Jin Seol-woon toward the mission. Jin Seol-woon tilted his head and thought carefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How long… it’s been almost 10 months…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So how do you feel about it? How’s composing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ugh, that was a bit too obvious just now. Having gotten a bit frustrated, I was being suspiciously persistent to anyone watching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon suddenly opened his eyes wide. Then he chuckled and looked up at me knowingly as he parted his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I like it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For about a second, silence flowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Okay, success! Nice.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I waved my hand lightly and left the pavilion to do other missions. I easily succeeded at Hae Mi-jun and Won Ha-ri’s missions next, then reconnected with Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had also saved just one person. According to Sa Ye-ho, this last person was the highlight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Obviously Woo Sae-geon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the mission we had saved for Woo Sae-geon was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something that would make every viewer watching this broadcast later have their eyes pop out and foam at the mouth as soon as the narration appeared on screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Lift him up and drop him in the water.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe I’ve been enduring everything up until now for this day when I get to dunk Woo Sae-geon in water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho and I were absolutely not crazy. This was doable. Woo Sae-geon was going to retire soon anyway. That bastard’s regime was ending.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We returned to where the pool and open-air bath were. Woo Sae-geon was lying on a sun bed with a hat covering his face, not having moved at all this whole time. You could call it a venerable pose that had continued since the first talk show broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho moved stealthily behind Woo Sae-geon’s head, completely silencing his footsteps. I took charge of Woo Sae-geon’s feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The little ones playing in the water—Won Ha-ri, Ma Cheon-ah, Yang Pyo, Hae Mi-jun—opened their eyes wide and stared at us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One, two, we exchanged glances and lifted from both sides at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait, gasp, wait a minute.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dying sounds came from me, not Woo Sae-geon. The sun bed was really incredibly heavy. Since I was groaning and couldn’t lift properly, only Sa Ye-ho’s side went up and the sun bed spun around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, beside my hands that were gripping the sun bed and straining with all my might, ridiculously large and thick knuckles grabbed on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When did that sleeping guy get here? Ja Hyeong-woo easily lifted Woo Sae-geon’s sun bed in my place. It quickly balanced with Sa Ye-ho’s side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Woo Sae-geon, even while clearly seeing what was happening, just went along obediently. With an utterly resigned expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s only response was to drop the hat he’d been holding against his chest onto the ground just before being thrown into the water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Splash—! The vigorous water spray mixed with the kids’ screams.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone except me, Ja Hyeong-woo, and Sa Ye-ho cowered in fear. Yang Pyo was so scared that he even dove underwater right when Woo Sae-geon’s head emerged from the water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The soaked dopo completely revealed his muscular body. Woo Sae-geon swept up the loose hair that had fallen from his topknot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His disheveled state was being filmed completely. It would probably air on the broadcast just like this. There was definitely annoyance in his eyes…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he said nothing even when he saw me and Sa Ye-ho bumping fists. It was unexpected that he didn’t even curse at me, let alone Sa Ye-ho. Scary, even.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The filming continued until the evening barbecue party. The round light bulbs Sa Ye-ho had turned on softly illuminated the dusky evening pool.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the system grilled the charcoal meat for us. We just had to sit and pick up the nicely grilled, good-looking pork belly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, how many pieces of meat are you taking? Have some conscience?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look who’s talking, put some rice on that lettuce. Are you playing bottom-card with meat?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo and Ma Cheon-ah were still bickering loudly. Earlier they’d had a water war that wouldn’t end until one of them drowned, and now they were fighting over the number of meat pieces going in their mouths.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually in private settings, those two are more peaceful than this, but they twisted the Twelve Zodiac lovers legend to make them appear like enemies for entertaining content for the public.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Looking at this, Yang Pyo isn’t completely clueless about broadcasting either.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at this point, I was really suspicious of Woo Sae-geon. The atmosphere had loosened up this much, and he was just letting it go for hours?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘We’ve already gone over the original broadcast filming time too. Even if this is filming for two episodes.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even ate with us. The old-fashioned guy who had never once shared a table with us in history.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the very end, without saying a word, just chewing whatever Sa Ye-ho piled meat on his plate and brought over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does retirement change a person this much? He’s really mellowed out a lot.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui and Won Ha-ri were eating well too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was going to eat his own food but had been pushing dishes closer to me since earlier. Does he think I’m so weak I can’t even reach across the table?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, this unnecessarily smart guy sometimes just covered the permanent marker with &lt;Puddle on a Rainy Day&gt;. How boring.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Jin Seol-woon kept asking me if it was delicious. Maybe revenge for the earlier mission.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly I turned my head at a vibrating sound from somewhere. Hae Mi-jun, who was sitting next to me, had taken out his buzzing phone and was fidgeting restlessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glimpsed “Mom” displayed on the screen.
 </span>
</p>
