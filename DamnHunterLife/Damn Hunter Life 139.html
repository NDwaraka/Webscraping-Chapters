  When Won Ha-ri cut down monsters individually at the front, the monsters she dismantled were finished off by the remaining successors who kept a certain distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though slightly unstable, Won Ha-ri completely unleashed her power through Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s support. While swinging her sword without rest, exerting influence as if Woo Sae-geon were there with them—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Jump down from there!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s voice rang out clearly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri flinched. A crack appeared in her movement for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Half the successors also stirred together. Their movements became slightly disturbed, creating gaps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon barely avoided having his arm bitten by a tiger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boss had appeared. In the middle of fighting small fry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t visible to their eyes. Rather than overwhelming them with massive size, this stage’s boss hid in that darkness disguised as other small fry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had become much more troublesome.

  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes carefully swept the surroundings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after hearing with his own two ears that vivid voice so identical to his own, his expression showed no change.

  Jin Seol-woon had just been lucky, had excellent reflexes in that moment, and barely avoided injury. If he’d been off by even an inch, he could have been immediately mauled by the tiger. To avoid danger, there couldn’t be even the slightest confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon rather instructed everyone to keep their mouths shut. Starting with himself using only chat.

  Myo Cho-hui’s eyes, as she strangled tiger bodies with vines, intermittently moved toward other directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes her mother stood among the tigers. Sometimes her father’s arm came trembling out from behind a tree as if in pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both parents reached out to Myo Cho-hui while being trampled by tigers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Ahhh, Cho-hui!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {It hurts so much, help me!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s face fixed into numbness. Her glaive spun once above her hand, then mercilessly stabbed that spot. The tiger’s death cry rang out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Disgusting. How dare you copy whose face and voice?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had withdrawn to the rear instead of fighting as a dealer with a sword, was grinding his molars from the impact spreading through his body occasionally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because they were A-rank, the monsters’ intelligence was quite high. They recognized that the dragon blocking their path had limits—that it was an existence that would disappear when its stamina ran out if they kept attacking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tigers’ teeth and claws attacking the dragon familiar’s body were steadily wearing down its master, Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, with Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi’s healing coming in, it’s manageable. I need to join up quickly…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who unconsciously looked toward the middle of the monsters, momentarily forgot what he’d been thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was another Gyeon Gang-hyeon there too. Wrapped in white clothes, standing precariously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His plump, soft-looking lips parted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {How far can you give up? To date me.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that the being the Jangsan tiger was imitating wasn’t an Innate member weighed heavily on Jin Seol-woon’s chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He turned his head this way and that to shake off the hallucination. He absolutely mustn’t be charmed, mustn’t respond even carelessly. It was being recorded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be troublesome if people inferred who the target of his hallucinations was.
 </span>
</p>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the status window floating before his eyes became clear. Jin Seol-woon, who stared intensely at the text, unconsciously let out a big breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How comforting a single cold text window could be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only Gyeon Gang-hyeon remained unswept away by anything, endlessly shooting arrows. He continuously sent chats to everyone without rest. He redirected his dazed teammates’ gazes back to combat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for Myo Cho-hui, everyone else was a hindrance. Whatever they were seeing in hallucinations, even Sa Ye-ho occasionally had delays in his movements and moved his lips as if saying something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s hyung.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even with monsters charging at them, they were getting disturbed in front of them, so only Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had to save everyone, could reach the extreme of exhaustion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One thing—though it didn’t linger long, there was a question that definitely crossed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The Jangsan tiger isn’t showing me anything or talking to me. To me it just looks like the original tiger form.’
 </span>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Calling out to Ja Hyeong-woo last among the four, Gyeon Gang-hyeon recalled yesterday’s conversation and twisted his lips slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yesterday, before the stage, he had called Ja Hyeong-woo aside separately. There was something he needed to ask only of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If the Jangsan tiger mentally attacks you… don’t make it obvious it’s me. Please.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What Ja Hyeong-woo muttered after a long while still remained in Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mind, tormenting him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You seem confident I’ll see you as a hallucination.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, Gyeon Gang-hyeon wanted to squeeze his eyes shut if his heart could have its way. He’d known he would say such things. He knew, but couldn’t help it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know now? How much I care about you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as Gyeon Gang-hyeon jabbed at him harshly as if startled, Ja Hyeong-woo softened his eyes gently as if not taking even a needle’s worth of damage. He even spouted worse words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You seem happy about it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had somehow felt like the guy was deliberately trying to fluster him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you don’t promise, I’ll remove you from this stage roster and put in Hae Mi-jun instead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that a threat?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been having the same recollection as Gyeon Gang-hyeon, soon returned to reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A large voice laughing brightly kept embracing Ja Hyeong-woo’s mind as he tried to concentrate on healing skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Making him want to give his whole mind over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Hyeong-woo! Han Hyeong-woo! This mountain is huge! Wow! Look at this! Here!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I look, I’ll definitely run over there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t look that way. Then another voice was heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Stupid, that’s fake! Don’t listen to that and come here. Ja Hyeong-woo!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was exactly like Gang-hyeon’s adult voice now. Even though he’d gone through puberty the same as himself, how could his voice be so pleasant to hear?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Two hallucinations…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the situation changed drastically once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cough!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to the monsters’ persistent attacks, the dragon familiar was reverse-summoned. The protective barrier that had been guarding them disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As a result, Jin Seol-woon breathed roughly and staggered. His body tilted once then returned with Ja Hyeong-woo’s support.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment their gazes briefly collided, not entirely pleasantly…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Jin Seol-woon, who had erased personal feelings, accepted Ja Hyeong-woo’s help to stand up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After urgently telling Myo Cho-hui and Sa Ye-ho to secure space, Gyeon Gang-hyeon focused on Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s posture while cutting down tigers was gradually crumbling. But that wasn’t from exhaustion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: I told you not to look! It’s a hallucination!

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon desperately held back his urge to shout for Won Ha-ri with all his might, only biting his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, there had been an aspect of pushing too hard from the beginning. Won Ha-ri was too young.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And for her age, she carried too great a sorrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…But you know, I couldn’t do anything for my brother. If he’d lived healthy like that for just one more year, then maybe I wouldn’t have regrets. There were so many things I wanted to do for him…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing tears finally streaming down her small cheeks, a deflated sigh escaped Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Enough. Won Ha-ri had fought well enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Won Ha-ri’s consciousness snap back. Won Ha-ri, who had stabbed three tigers in front of her to death, showed confusion. Her shouted voice cracked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do we do if I don’t block them? What do we do!”
 </span>
</p>

  Me: It’s okay. Trust my words

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, Won Ha-ri retreated according to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s order. Immediately the tigers from the side she’d been blocking poured out like a flood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Their attention focused on Gyeon Gang-hyeon. He faced the tigers calmly without a hint of tension.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The attributes don’t match, but.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He released the energy he’d gathered strongly from within his body. In the form of a skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An impact like being struck all over by a heavy club. A sharp scream burst from his lungs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the skill activation succeeded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;When You Die Everything Becomes Earth (Earth Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tiger that had been charging with its mouth wide open turned to earth with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An advanced skill he’d manifested but tried not to use unless absolutely necessary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now, even if it meant suffering major internal injuries, he had to show his teammates and people. There was a need to reverse the flow once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To prove that even if the current leader was physically weak, he could kill dozens of A-rank monsters with purely the power of his attribute skills alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon swallowed the hot pain rising from within and targeted one spot in his vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s there.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While all surrounding monsters returned to handfuls of earth and scattered, only one tiger maintained its original form.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However… no successor had preserved enough energy to face an A-rank boss.
