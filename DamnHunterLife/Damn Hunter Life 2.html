  Damn Hunter Life 2

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a deep intention behind Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s decision to deliberately pour cold water on what could have been a warm restaurant atmosphere if left alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The kids are praising me too much. I’m giving you a preventive shot to help you come to your senses.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said this because he had watched in frustration as some successors in the original work got cocky from students’ praise and were severely injured in the next wave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While he was trying to provoke them, he was also sincere about thinking the strategy time had taken too long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon could say this with certainty since he knew the original work’s content up to the mid-to-late stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If they knew how brutal the waves that come later are, they wouldn’t be able to just sit around eating like that Ja Hyeong-woo.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the current situation was from Chapter 1, all the characters including the protagonist were beginners, so it couldn’t be helped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We have a long way to go, but if we spend hours on just Stage 25…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Gyeon Gang-hyeon said this, the students would just sneer anyway. What would that drunkard know?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo, being a successor, would have his pride wounded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, it would just be the ramblings of a drunkard, so there’d be no suspicion that Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s soul had changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Second, it would stimulate the original protagonist to train even harder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a perfect plan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the next step, Gyeon Gang-hyeon immediately relaxed his eyes. He dropped his arms on the table with a thud and dragged out his pronunciation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Nooo, I mean. You’re such fucking great successors, so why did it take six hours…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he was acting drunk while completely sober, Gyeon Gang-hyeon thought for a moment that he had quite a talent for acting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The deflated students sighed. Of course. When would that successor’s disgrace not be drunk and disorderly? He had been acting normal until just now, but even that seemed to have been drunken behavior. Some students blushed with embarrassment over Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tension also left Ja Hyeong-woo’s hardened face, replaced only by feelings of disappointment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo dismissed the status window that was tactlessly fanning the flames.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The students sent desperate looks to Ja Hyeong-woo. Please kick out that Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Ja Hyeong-woo felt the same way. His mission right now was to quickly get that person out of the restaurant so he’d stop being drunk and disorderly and quietly return to his quarters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had paused the screen video, lifted up his completely cleaned food tray.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon, follow me out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Speaking of Ja Hyeong-woo, despite being the current protagonist, he looked exactly like a Silla Dynasty hwarang. This was due to the hunter imagery that borrowed from Eastern zodiac materials.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On top of that, he was fully dressed in hwarang clothes, which were hunter uniforms, and dragged me to a nearby pavilion in the most conspicuous manner possible, so the students’ gazes were bound to focus on us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What the hell is this bastard trying to curse me out for that he dragged me out here?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering the relationship between Ja Hyeong-woo and Gyeon Gang-hyeon mentioned in the original work, I’d be lucky if he doesn’t grab me by the collar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first action of the original protagonist sitting upright across the table was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Huh?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A long staff with blue waves rippling appeared in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand. It was a healer’s staff imbued with the power of water among the five elements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is a combat weapon coming out now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo poked my forehead with the tip of that staff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  “Now you can speak properly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Uh… this is a bit troublesome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now, I could make risky statements because I was hiding behind the shield of alcohol.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s going to protect me from my own statements now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body became refreshed against my will. Ja Hyeong-woo put the staff back into his inventory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sit up straight.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he immediately started criticizing my sitting posture. He was as inflexible as he looked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not only did I not listen to him, I even bent my eyebrows crookedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he pushed aside his black durumagi, the blue vest-like jeogori he wore underneath was revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, the visuals are decent. It’s not for nothing that the Twelve Zodiac hunters’ personal combat uniforms were set as special functional hanbok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In contrast, I’m just… the material of a skinny young master wastrel who drinks heavily and frequents brothels?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are your clothes like that? Your outer garment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes swept over me like I was an animal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is this guy also a underwear=pants supporter? Like the status window?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Don’t make me laugh. If underwear is pants, then why are you wearing briefs under your hanbok? I saw it all in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I chose to ignore him. Since a long conversation would only be disadvantageous to me, let’s just get to the point simply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you want to say?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The conversation from now on wasn’t in the original work at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because in the original work, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was already dead, and Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t have the ability to talk to dead people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At most, he could have left some final words over dead Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo pressed his visibly tired eyelids with his fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m thinking I called you out here for nothing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who’s he trying to fool?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But soon, anger filled Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes visible between his fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This stage was really difficult. Seol-woon almost got hurt again even though he’s already injured and went into the gate. You know?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You mean the Dragon successor? Is it such a big deal for an earth attribute tanker to get hurt?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I first spat out a shameless line.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about it carefully, there was good provocative material to further stimulate Ja Hyeong-woo’s competitive spirit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. When comrades get hurt, it’s because of the healer. Because the healer’s abilities are insufficient.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just told one of the most talented healers among the successors that ‘you’re insufficient.’ An unawakened successor, how dare I.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A deadly chill flowed over the table. Ja Hyeong-woo’s piercing cold gaze stabbed like an arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m talking about you right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who calmly turned the subject to me, finally brought up the main point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How can you say such things? And in front of other students? Aren’t you ashamed? What do you know about combat…! You have no experience and do nothing, so what right do you have to give advice?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did I say? I was drunk so I don’t remember.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even I think I’m irritatingly obnoxious right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, I had laid out my sleeping mat after checking where I’d lie down. If it had been another successor instead of Ja Hyeong-woo across from me, I wouldn’t have scratched at his insides this much. I could really die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether I pretended not to know or not, Ja Hyeong-woo continued with what he wanted to say. His deeply accumulated resentment seemed to pour out relentlessly with his words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine, let’s say the successors’ performance is lackluster. Do you know whose fault that is? Do you really think it’s because of me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So this topic finally comes up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I look directly at Ja Hyeong-woo’s distorted face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you hadn’t made that stupid mistake back then… It’s all your fault. If only you had been in the strategy team, if only you had awakened, others would be having less difficulty than this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He should have awakened long ago. But Gyeon Gang-hyeon made a ‘big mistake’ that damaged his body and missed his awakening opportunity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fellow comrades and outsiders alike criticized Gyeon Gang-hyeon. With his body in poor condition and others’ criticism pouring down on him, the original Gyeon Gang-hyeon gave up on everything. Driven mad by frustration, he became a drunk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking only up to this point, he’d seem pitiful, but since he’s been causing trouble and making mischief everywhere for months without a single apology, even the sympathy that existed has disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is exactly the kind of character I’ve possessed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please have some shame.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I watched Ja Hyeong-woo hold his forehead without giving any particular response.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Other hunters treat Gyeon Gang-hyeon as if he doesn’t exist, but Ja Hyeong-woo was different. He persistently sought him out and got on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s nerves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, Ja Hyeong-woo was the only one who didn’t give up on Gyeon Gang-hyeon until the end. Until Gyeon Gang-hyeon died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Actually, in the current situation, he’s almost the only one on my side…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It lacks credibility to suddenly declare ‘I’ll reform from now on’ here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I still have things to do in this scoundrel state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint Ja Hyeong-woo again this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said it’s difficult because of me. But it would still be less difficult than if I actually died, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, a cracking sound came from under Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand placed on the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you threatening me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s just a hypothetical.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was a bit scared. I imagined that hand grabbing my bones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo seemed too disgusted to talk anymore, putting his durumagi back on after just 5 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s nothing to expect from you. You’re disappointing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m also curious. I wonder if there’s anyone in the work that Gyeon Gang-hyeon hasn’t disappointed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s cold gaze, who was about to leave, pierced into me for some time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original work that begins in earnest after Gyeon Gang-hyeon dies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the work, Ja Hyeong-woo occasionally misses his past with Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Even when seeing hallucinations due to gate monsters’ actions, he recalls his childhood with Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, the two had a pretty good relationship when they were young. Since childhood friends both became successors, those around them had high expectations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, their relationship became strained when Ja Hyeong-woo awakened first while Gyeon Gang-hyeon remained a poor student. More precisely, it was right that Gyeon Gang-hyeon unilaterally abandoned Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The current you would die immediately just from being grazed by a monster’s claws. Keep living pathetically like that. Reeking of alcohol.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether the harsh words pierced my ears or not, I briefly had other thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Gyeon Gang-hyeon doesn’t die… how much will the original work change?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, one thing is certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s death was both trauma and a growth point for Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I didn’t die. Since my death is absent and Ja Hyeong-woo won’t be able to grow one stage, I should take responsibility for this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, you little rat.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The protagonist who was about to exit turned toward me. His straight eyes were sharp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll absolutely never die. You take care of your own business. You healer bastard whose healing sucks.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll growl at him every time we meet and thoroughly make him uncomfortable. That way, I’ll make that bastard grow even if it’s out of anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo let out a low sigh between his teeth and glared at me fiercely. He left with his durumagi fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Okay, provocation complete.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Turns out successors could order from the restaurant to their homes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No wonder everyone was staring when I went to the restaurant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, I solved lunch and dinner at my hideout without going out. Even though I was holed up all day doing nothing, I was busy in my own way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need to write down all the Twelve Zodiac abilities I can remember.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a novel with excessive settings. Skills divided by the five element attributes could be modified, researched, and combined in various branches.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This information is my only backing and wealth.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t keep living as a scoundrel. Later I’ll have to renovate my image and join that Twelve Zodiac group to fight together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That way I can receive a pension when I retire later.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I keep living like this, the country won’t give me a penny. It’s fine now while I’m at hunter school, but what if I turn 24 and get kicked out of hunter school for being over age? I’ll be penniless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So there’s only one goal here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Work my ass off now to secure a pension after retirement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ’22, 23, 24 years old. Only 3 years left.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the point is, for my old age, it would be good to awaken even now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But how do I awaken? It’s random in the end.”

  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I spread out the notebook where I’d written down the original work’s settings and watched it together with the video. My eyes busily followed the combat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Isn’t there a summary version? Someone edit it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was quite an ordeal since it was 6 hours long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the next video was the feedback briefing that successors always held after finishing a strategy… this was a video that non-Twelve Zodiac people couldn’t watch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I could peek since I was a successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the video, people in colorful hanbok sat around a round table. The meeting was centered around Woo Sae-geon, the eldest and tanker leader who was the Ox successor, and main healer Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone was talking about who did well, who made mistakes, how the 5-person limit made things difficult this time, but watching it, I had only one thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The combination was wrong from the start.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first gate and the S-rank gate ‘Stage’ that would never close.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This first gate was different from dungeon entrances that opened randomly around the world. Stage was in game format, and the penalty for failed strategies was severe. Probably enough to blow away the entire hunter school?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, befitting the name of being in game format, Stage provided advance information to strategy personnel like this.

  Eoduksini was a yokai that feeds on human fear and was a ghost that hides in darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So they seemed to have responded by putting fire attributes in the lead…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They need to break free from the fixed notion that all attributes should be evenly distributed to make progress. Make more aggressive monster-targeting combinations.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After watching all the feedback videos, I manipulated the status window to delete my viewing records and escaped. No one would have seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If they heard that Gyeon Gang-hyeon watched such videos, they’d immediately find it suspicious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon erased his traces and disappeared quite quickly…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But coincidentally, there was another successor looking at the status window at that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was rewatching the feedback video for the fifth time in his dark room when he discovered the record being deleted. A surprised voice cut through the darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon… hyung?”
