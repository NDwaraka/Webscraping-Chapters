  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 116
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When my eye level matched Ja Hyeong-woo’s, my heart sank with a thump as if I was anxious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was uncomfortable having my entire field of vision filled with that bastard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won’t you get lost? I’m fine. If my body wasn’t well right now, Squeaky would have come out already. Squeaky can handle everything on his own. Am I wrong?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips moved for a while. An inexplicable, troubled expression as if his heart was being pulled circled his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But after his eyelids opened and closed several times, Ja Hyeong-woo’s face had returned to its original shameless color.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you didn’t want me to come, you shouldn’t have been sitting there like a lost child.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What… what?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the midst of my head aching from this fresh bullshit, Ja Hyeong-woo extended his hand to me. As if telling me to take it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me your hand. I’m going to flow water through to check your overall condition.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was at that moment when I let my guard down while snapping at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo grabbed and lifted my left ankle, which was closest to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing—!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I struggled, soon my other ankle was also caught and pinned to the floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had easily subdued me, smoothly pulled off the shoe from my foot lifted in the air. The problem was that I had just washed my feet refreshingly after training and was only wearing slippers on bare feet!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo spread his palm and firmly grasped my white foot exposed under the lighting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My toes curled from the hot body temperature. Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze touched my five toes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shame comparable to having my underwear stripped off surged up. I bit my molars tightly and raised my right arm high.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what my palm struck wasn’t Ja Hyeong-woo’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smack! A strong friction sound spread from my palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sound was just loud, but it probably only tickled Ja Hyeong-woo. The proof was that this bastard’s cheek was fine while only my hand turned red and numb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A nonchalant sound popped out from that bastard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, with a calm face as if nothing had happened, grabbed my hand that was spaced out in the air. He put cool water energy into my slightly reddened hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you surprised when you’re the one who hit me. You didn’t have such vicious intentions?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This detestable bastard…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw it clearly. He could have dodged but definitely deliberately offered his cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This wasn’t me hitting him. Half of it was Ja Hyeong-woo choosing to get hit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should have realized he was crazy from when he started hurting his own body to get revenge on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why you should just give me your hand when I ask for it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I came to my senses, I had already given both my left foot and right hand to Ja Hyeong-woo. After turning someone’s appearance upside down, Ja Hyeong-woo calmly went about his business.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just imagined smacking that consistently expressionless face about six times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You little rat bastard…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems this level of cursing doesn’t do any damage to Ja Hyeong-woo anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then I should do it worse. There are many ways to really hurt him. As long as I’m Gyeon Gang-hyeon—’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No other words came to mind beyond that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As my whole body stiffened, only the sensation transmitted to my foot became clear. The feeling of Ja Hyeong-woo’s skin and blue light touching simultaneously was truly bizarre. It was like soaking my foot in cool water, but the bottom touching it was like a heated stone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The water energy that had been penetrating my body soon disappeared. Ja Hyeong-woo, who had silently achieved his goal, picked up the scattered slipper and put it on my foot himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did I withdraw all my hands and feet with disgust.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suddenly think.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original Gyeon Gang-hyeon, even if he was a character who died quickly, shouldn’t he have been mentioned in detail? Why was he never properly described?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …When he’s so important to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was he really just a simple catalyst? If there’s a reason he wasn’t ‘talked about’ in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then what is Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s real role?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A day passed, and my heart calmed down enough that I could finally make a decision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, let’s do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if situations where I use the familiar affinity ability don’t arise, I should at least experiment to see if I can use it reliably when I want to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A little earlier morning than usual. As soon as I walked step by step down the corridor and threw open the earth attribute training room door, Jin Seol-woon was visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, can I use your familiar?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he had expected my request, Jin Seol-woon immediately summoned his dragon. Then he obediently stepped back three paces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do whatever you want to try. I’ll only intervene if a dangerous situation arises.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon in front of me, a dragon with its body coiled in curves positioned itself with its neck that reached the ceiling folded once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A friend with a much better first impression than the crazy ox or monster sheep. I had once received help from him on stage too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s only one way to talk to someone else’s pet, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I held out my hand under the dragon’s nose. When getting friendly with animals, you have to let them smell you first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see Jin Seol-woon smiling slyly from behind. Why, what. I raised my eyebrows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right at that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon fully rested its snout on my hand. Though it was a spirit, I felt some weight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon’s flowing whiskers passed by the side of my face. The dragon rubbed the side of its snout against my body. Just like what it does to Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind us, the real owner was watching us with surprised eyes, arms unfolded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Excluding special cases like Squeaky or Puppy, ordinary familiars have no self-awareness. They’re just the owner’s possessions, something like part of the owner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, their tendencies seem to reflect their owner.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So it’s being polite to me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, the dragon snout that had been nuzzling my palm affectionately seemed to gradually move downward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A branch of the horn came between my legs. Huh?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The horn is caught. Just a moment…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I could lift my leg to get out, my body was lifted first. The dragon carried me on its head and slowly raised its neck. Huh?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My feet left the ground. My butt that had slid down settled on the dragon’s long snout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This isn’t how you ride a dragon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the direction was backwards. I had my face buried in the dragon’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It didn’t end there—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you taking me into your coil? Dragon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a brief moment, the dragon coiled its body and trapped me inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like being trapped inside a round ball of yarn. Wherever I looked, I could only see brown translucent body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And beyond that, Jin Seol-woon’s flustered face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, Jin Seol-woon. How do you control this? He pretends to be gentle but does whatever he wants?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was more serious than I thought. I tried patting and coaxing, but the dragon didn’t budge. Since it wouldn’t listen, I had no choice but to squeeze out myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After knocking off my shoes, I stood up on the dragon’s snout and pressed the center of the dragon’s forehead firmly with my foot. I planned to use that as a foothold to pry open the gap with my hands and escape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly the dragon fluttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The space that had been loosening squeezed me even tighter. I could hear Jin Seol-woon calling “Gang-hyeon-ssi!” for a moment, then it became faint. My body tilted sharply. I felt like I was being buried somewhere along with the dragon, then soon passed through something like a wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m stuck in a wall! Or am I stuck in the floor? What’s happening to me right now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon entered the dirt ground carrying me!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was terrified by the feeling of being buried alive, the feeling of dirt filling even my ears. Even at this moment, I was being dragged deeper and deeper. I was in such a panic that I was just screaming—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s okay, I got you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A quiet voice was heard right in front of the dirt-blocked area, close to my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s hands penetrated through the dirt. One hand wrapped around my back, the other around my waist, then pulled hard. Dirt crumbled down like pulling out a potato.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so I, safely rescued and placed on the floor… was in complete beggar’s state. Combined with the white clothes that had little white left, I truly looked like someone who had emerged from a grave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My appearance must have been seriously bad for Jin Seol-woon to widen his eyes. Jin Seol-woon’s hands went down my hair, shoulders, chest, and waist, mercilessly brushing off dirt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t stop him and grumbled bluntly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, I’m grateful, but I don’t think that’ll work.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I had to stop the experiment and go home to bathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon followed me to my house. He waited outside the bathroom while I washed, then stood up from the sofa as soon as I came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Water droplets dripped from my wet hair. While I patted it dry with a towel, Jin Seol-woon just stared at me blankly for some reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was the too-much sense of daily life from a colleague strange?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I definitely shouldn’t steal and use other people’s familiars. Who knows what might happen. (Excluding Squeaky who has a will, I mean.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was too presumptuous.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. I should have stopped it. I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Earth attribute is already going haywire… What am I supposed to do when even a troublemaker like me is here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But how should I interpret what happened earlier? Was it telling me to go screw myself?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did your dragon do that? Did you ask?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat on the sofa and confronted Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually… there’s nothing to ask about. I know what that behavior means.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You already know? Like problematic behavior of a pet you’re raising?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “At the Busan Gate before, and even earlier when I got hurt while going through trial and error, it did the same thing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know about the Busan Gate too. Come to think of it, Jin Seol-woon was buried in the ground then too and Woo Sae-geon had pulled him out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an incident that occurred when Jin Seol-woon lost consciousness during battle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When it judges that the owner’s life is in critical condition, the dragon buries the owner underground. It’s like an instinct to protect from primary danger, something like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But why did it do that to me too…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was replying absentmindedly, then couldn’t finish my words and went blank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s steady gaze was watching me. Jin Seol-woon also knew that I understood what it meant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …To point out one thing, I wasn’t hurt anywhere right now. Since I hadn’t entered a stage in a while, I didn’t even need Squeaky’s heal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “May I ask? What exactly is Gang-hyeon-ssi’s condition?”
 </span>
</p>
