<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  About a month ago, when Woo Sae-geon was still at school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s combat instruction at the earth attribute training ground led to healer training to quickly treat Jin Seol-woon, who had become injured from being brutally beaten up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Ja Hyeong-woo finished healing at maximum speed and left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone’s presence lingered outside the training room door where Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Ja Hyeong-woo were for quite a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had come with the intention of barging in midway, but when it came down to it, he couldn’t bring himself to do it and just paced around in front of the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Through the crack in the door, he had caught sight of the way Gang-hyeon gazed at Ja Hyeong-woo while receiving healing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It wasn’t just Ja Hyeong-woo being one-sidedly swayed around.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An expression of being stirred up by the other person. Jin Seol-woon knew very well what that was. Even if he hadn’t known before, he knew now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because every time Gang-hyeon looked weak and pitiful, he himself wore exactly that expression reflected in the mirror.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon looked down at his own innocent hands and thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If only I were a healer……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had been staring blankly at his hands, bit his lip. His fingertips grew cold from the rising sense of deprivation. But instead of letting his hands fall, he clenched them into fists.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He lost track of Gang-hyeon midway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day after conquering Stage 44, Ja Hyeong-woo was wandering around the school having stayed up all night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His long black hair, left unbound, fluttered in the cold wind. He wore a black jeogori—or in local terms, just underwear. All the students who passed by and encountered him were startled and whispered among themselves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regardless, Ja Hyeong-woo was solely focused on gauging what Gang-hyeon’s physical condition might be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had abandoned his training and followed him the whole time, but at some point the trail went cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the mouse familiar wasn’t attached to him anymore, tracking was impossible. In the end, he had to run around searching on foot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He didn’t leave this building.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The last place was probably inside this central building.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had gone in to support a hunter’s training, so it should be ending soon. Not knowing if that spot was in a surveillance camera exposure area, Ja Hyeong-woo waited outside for Gang-hyeon for quite a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the waiting time gradually grew longer, a dark shadow fell across Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What if he collapsed?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, there was also the possibility he had moved using the teleportation function. However, since he had already confirmed he wasn’t home, he probably got tired of walking and used Sa Ye-ho or someone else as a teleportation waypoint……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes caught sight of a boy coming out of the building.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the regular student Gang-hyeon had gone to help train. He strode over and blocked Kwak Ji-hong’s path.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon…… Do you know where Gyeon Gang-hyeon is?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A man as large as a bear rather than a mouse had appeared. A man who had forgotten even his habit of deliberately relaxing his expression in front of young people so they wouldn’t be afraid of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong knew who the man in front of him was, which was the only reason he managed to barely hold back from screaming.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, he left earlier. I…… I’m not really sure.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a time that was already 30 minutes past.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally acknowledging that he had completely lost track of him, Ja Hyeong-woo steeled himself for Gang-hyeon’s future annoyance and texted him directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When there was no reply even after a long while, he even resorted to the group chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse Successor: Has anyone seen Gang-hyeon?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon answers came back one by one. After confirming that only unhelpful messages saying they didn’t know appeared next to each animal name, he looked up at the central building.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After pushing open every training room door and searching the building like hunting for mice, he finally found him. White hands and sleeves that had fallen beneath a chair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rushing in so hastily he nearly broke the hinges, Ja Hyeong-woo was blocked once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a presence standing there, preventing him from approaching any further.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A brown body. A blunt form that wasn’t human. Even though its features weren’t clearly visible, Ja Hyeong-woo recognized that the other party was glaring at him fiercely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strange neural stimulus rang through his mind, like tinnitus drilling into his ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The eerie feeling soon disappeared to the back of his mind, but Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t take his eyes off the boy for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While thinking ‘Could it be……’, he also nodded in understanding and muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You were Gang-hyeon’s familiar. You’ve been by Gang-hyeon’s side all this time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had somewhat expected it when he heard the voice last time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the boy was relatively small in stature, even with his body fully spread out, he couldn’t completely hide Gang-hyeon behind him. Therefore, Ja Hyeong-woo was able to see in full the pitiful sight that completely stole away his composure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the dog familiar was preventing him from getting close.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t block me. Gang-hyeon is hurt. You know that too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar said something else. In a very insincere and displeased tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {You came to do weird things to Hyeon-i.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s breathing that reached his ears was faint. Ja Hyeong-woo attempted an urgent persuasion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s the treatment method. Through those acts, I draw out my yang energy and deliver it to Gang-hyeon through the places we touch, like breathing life into him.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Then why didn’t you tell Hyeon-i?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the child’s sharp reproach, Ja Hyeong-woo’s movement came to an abrupt halt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hah. Only the short breath that Ja Hyeong-woo let out of his own accord remained where his words had been cut off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……I was scared. Scared I wouldn’t be accepted.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Heavy emotions like earth were carried in the boy’s deep exhalation. His faintly visible arms crossed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I don’t like you.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar had been rejecting Ja Hyeong-woo from the beginning. Ja Hyeong-woo understood the dog familiar’s feelings well. Because they were his own feelings too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t like myself either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two figures soon looked at each other face to face. Their gazes tangled and their perceptions mixed together. As if defying time, space, and existence all at once. As if two became one, and one became two.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {What does it matter whether he accepts you or not? It doesn’t matter at all. What matters is Hyeon-i.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. What matters is Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Different voices overlapped as one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, to someone, that sound seemed like Ja Hyeong-woo’s soliloquy from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was holding his breath and listening to the sound flowing out through the crack in the closed door from beyond the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When you experience something too incomprehensible, your thoughts stop instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pop, when Ja Hyeong-woo sucked on my lips once and released them, I could painfully realize that fact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Transparent mucus stretched long from that bastard’s smooth lips before dropping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His sea-black pupils stared intently at me without even blinking. My dazed eyes were contained within his irises.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The feeling of my heart stopping with a thump. A sinking feeling struck me as if my whole body was plummeting underground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pushed against his chest with whatever I could grab and hurriedly backed away. A wall touched my back that I had raised in panic. Cold chill flowed down refreshingly from my back through my whole body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What…… what are you doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that bastard babbled some excuse, would I really be convinced by it? No. That couldn’t happen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet I repeated meaningless words. Ja Hyeong-woo’s silence was unbearable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Treatment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who was kneeling, had lowered both arms and was gazing at me steadily. Thanks to his long loose hair, he looked like a criminal at first glance, but that was just my wishful thinking—his eyes were calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why are you so confident?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head spun round and round like before falling asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I raised my hand to cover my lips and rubbed them hard repeatedly, only then realizing my face was burning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crazy bastard. ……You’re a crazy bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I forced strength into my trembling hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smack! Even after being slapped hard enough to turn his head, Ja Hyeong-woo remained silent. Only my palm stung more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now even the back of my neck was all hot. I couldn’t remember when I had felt cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of that bastard’s attitude—not turning his twisted head back, keeping his gaze in that same spot, as if he would obediently take the beating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry I couldn’t tell you beforehand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it was an apology or what, I couldn’t even hear such bullshit, and only the lips that spoke those words caught my eye. Remembering how that flesh had held mine made it hard to concentrate. My heart pounded even harder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t have to look at my face again. You don’t have to forgive me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo slowly turned his face. Our eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart, which had been beating hard, stopped abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My breath caught, and an incomprehensible tension seized my body. The breath I slowly and consciously exhaled sounded pathetically ragged even to my own ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But let’s do it just once more right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You’re still hurting. The moment Ja Hyeong-woo whispered earnestly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I teleported home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after the air changed did I barely open my tightly shut eyes. My head felt dull as if overworked. I felt the contradictory emotions of wanting to do something to ventilate my mind, while on the other hand not wanting to do anything at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But today’s rude bastard wasn’t the end of it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the place I had fled to without thinking, Jin Seol-woon was leaning against the wall with darkness draped over his shoulders.
 </span>
