  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 4
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he was very eager to see the house that Cheon Gang-hyeon’s hands had touched, he wanted to savor Gang-hyeon himself even more. Han Hyeong-woo first plopped down on the sofa. He gently gestured to Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who glared as much as he could but still followed along, was so endearing. Han Hyeong-woo sat close, pressing their bodies together. Cheon Gang-hyeon flinched at the arm that slipped around his waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When did you come home?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since this morning……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I thought so. Is that why you wouldn’t do video calls?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is our home now. Han Hyeong-woo rubbed his nose against Cheon Gang-hyeon’s hair and whispered in a subtle tone. Cheon Gang-hyeon gritted his teeth tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Move away a bit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. I can’t.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it had been so long for both of them, just being together created a strange sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s been so long…… I can’t get used to it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pink color spread across Cheon Gang-hyeon’s cheek as he turned his head as far away as possible. Han Hyeong-woo couldn’t see it right away since he was busy burying his nose in his nape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The lips that had been nuzzling his smooth neck finally parted and extended his tongue. Han Hyeong-woo frantically licked and sucked his nape like someone who hadn’t had water for three days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, hnngh, hah—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Red and purple marks quickly appeared on the white skin. Cheon Gang-hyeon twisted his neck and moaned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing the moaning sound, all thoughts disappeared from Han Hyeong-woo’s mind. He really had some intention of resting peacefully together, just a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon groaned and leaned his body. He couldn’t handle the hand that was deliberately digging into his waist. When Cheon Gang-hyeon half-lay on the sofa, Han Hyeong-woo rested his chin on his chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Cheon Gang-hyeon trembled with a start. Strength also entered Han Hyeong-woo’s jaw with a snap. In that state, he spoke quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I washed up before coming today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What that meant was obvious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Their eyes met. Murky heat rippled in Han Hyeong-woo’s black pupils. Cheon Gang-hyeon trembled as if his breath was being cut off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said you’d come pick me up from the library, no, that you’d come?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I brought you and immediately……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon was about to curse something. Han Hyeong-woo buried his face in his chest and made a slightly mumbling pronunciation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But Gang-hyeon, it seems like you washed too. Right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There had been a shampoo scent from his hair. Han Hyeong-woo asked while thinking ‘no way.’ The skin that had gradually heated up was now almost radiating heat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon stiffened his body as if he’d been hit. His face was already burning bright red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Yeah, I washed. Happy now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Truthfully, Cheon Gang-hyeon had also been expecting this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And today was actually Han Hyeong-woo’s 24th birthday too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, exactly one year ago on that day, the two had sex for the first time with each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo’s lips kept twitching. Even while restlessly licking over clothes, he continued mumbling something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did you wash? It’s kind of an ambiguous time to wash, isn’t it? Hm?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Persistently trying to draw out the words he wanted to hear from Cheon Gang-hyeon’s mouth was still the same. This guy hadn’t changed one bit in a year.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Irritation surged up, and Cheon Gang-hyeon grumbled a bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Don’t ask what you already know without me saying it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hah, Han Hyeong-woo exhaled the breath that had long since reached its limit. It felt like all the sensations in his body had concentrated in his lower half. His member hidden in his underwear swelled up, pathetically leaking precum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He gave Cheon Gang-hyeon one last warning in a very sweet tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the one who provoked this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He urgently stripped off Cheon Gang-hyeon’s t-shirt. Before both arms could even come out of the t-shirt that was roughly pulled up, he put his mouth to the exposed bare chest first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon had his nipples sucked without warning. Perhaps because he was greatly tense after so long, even though it was his first time being caressed there, an untouchably sensual sensation welled up. Ahhk……! Cheon Gang-hyeon threw his head back and let out a moan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t know why such sweetness came from the tiny grain-like nipples. Han Hyeong-woo lightly bit them with his teeth and rolled them around wildly with his tongue. He kneaded the opposite chest with his hand while talking ecstatically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I really wanted to do this. When you’d go to sleep and hang up the call, I came by myself several times a week. There were times I woke up damp too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hk, hah……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Red marks bloomed over his pale chest. It wasn’t quite appropriate for doing in the bright daylight. But Cheon Gang-hyeon had no capacity to worry about such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His head couldn’t keep up with Han Hyeong-woo’s movements at all. Only after his lower back bounced up into the air could he realize that Han Hyeong-woo’s hand had entered his pants.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said you put on a little weight during this time, and it’s really true.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There seemed to be more flesh caught in his grip than before. Just as he remembered, it was chewy and elastic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he had just stopped being an awakener, there was some variation in his grip strength, making it difficult to control his force. He roughly handled the bare flesh enough to leave red handprints.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon completely dropped the back of his head on the sofa and twisted his body while strangely panting heavily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo exhaled moist breath as he smoothly stood up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bare chest in front of his eyes glistened with his saliva. While Cheon Gang-hyeon couldn’t collect himself, Han Hyeong-woo stealthily stripped off his pants and tasted his straight member that was slightly erect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hheu!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His buttocks and thighs contracted violently. His member twitched up and tapped Han Hyeong-woo’s lips. Even though Cheon Gang-hyeon had moved and touched him, he writhed as if he was the one being attacked and let out lewd breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After lightly kissing the tip of his glans, he took advantage of Cheon Gang-hyeon panting like he was having a seizure to spread his legs to both sides. His appetizing perineum was revealed like a split apple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With completely turned eyes, he buried his face there without hesitation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ahh! What, hngh! Don’t! Hey! Uh, hk!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon struggled wildly. What he felt from his widely spread buttocks was, unbelievably and not wanting to believe it, Han Hyeong-woo’s nose bridge and brow. Unbearably ticklish feelings and shame rushed over him as he flailed his arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He licked the tightly closed hole with his tongue. He wetly moistened the entrance with abundantly produced saliva.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He quietly shuddered at the texture of wrinkles felt at the tip of his tongue. Thinking that his member would enter this place soon, his reason naturally blurred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop, take your face away! Heu, hh……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But with just his tongue, there was difficulty in penetrating the entrance. Most of all, it was because Cheon Gang-hyeon, perhaps thinking it was do-or-die, was putting all his strength behind him and trying to resist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually Han Hyeong-woo raised his head without much gain. As he swallowed with his tongue the saliva that had spread to his own lips from touching Gang-hyeon’s place, Cheon Gang-hyeon raged furiously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You…… go brush your teeth! If you don’t, I won’t do it either!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did he properly look at Cheon Gang-hyeon’s state. His entire body had turned bright red from excitement or humiliation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet his self-erected member had ripened to a good color, and every time Cheon Gang-hyeon shouted, it dripped clear fluid drop by drop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Brush his teeth? Why should he do that? He had only finally received the delicious thing he’d wanted to taste from before…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won’t you kiss me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Han Hyeong-woo show realization.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the thought hit him that he’d have to bite and suck Cheon Gang-hyeon’s lips with this mouth, he finally seemed to understand a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, at that moment, Cheon Gang-hyeon, who had blurted out that hastily made-up excuse, wanted to die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As it turned out, Han Hyeong-woo had somehow hidden gel in his luggage. For Cheon Gang-hyeon, it was absolutely maddening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it okay? I’m moving a bit slowly since it’s been a while, in case you’d be surprised, ngh……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hheu, hh……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon tried to grasp the situation several times, but kept repeating the cycle of forgetting completely due to being too painful or Han Hyeong-woo grabbing and touching his member.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he bit his hand and barely came to his senses to find this situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naked and stuck together in a primordial state, spreading his legs wide and receiving Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was enough to drive him crazy, but Han Hyeong-woo was saying even crazier things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. You were so sexy just now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He held up his gel-wet hand and checked the hand Cheon Gang-hyeon had just bitten.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But don’t do this again. You’ll get hurt.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who was about to say something, only let out “Uhheu……” in a moan. A large member was penetrating below him, slowly moving in and out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a bit slower than before. Should I do it properly now? Is it okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A beast pretending to be human also speaks human words. While his mouth licks Cheon Gang-hyeon’s earlobe and his hand gropes his spine, causing complete chaos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon barely suppressed the pleasure rampaging throughout his body and blurted out a curse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s already fast, you son of a bitch!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Got it. Thanks.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The crazy bastard who speaks human words but can’t understand human speech thrust his waist with a thud.
 </span>
