<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had been watching Gyeon Gang-hyeon, was just biting his fist behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Shouldn’t I stop that hyung?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said this was closer to tickling, but no matter how you look at it, it feels a bit like… torture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do’s temples were already wet with sweat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s merciless fingers headed toward his neck again, he gasped out his surrender.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please stop.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just with words?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll give it to you, so please stop.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to Woo Sae-geon’s monologue, Woo Sae-geon is already anticipating the ripple effects Gyeon Gang-hyeon will cause in the future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then even if he gives past data, there wouldn’t be much damage to him. Choi Jung-do compromised with himself that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His roughened gaze turned toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Choi Jung-do exhaled hot breath while advising the younger successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And never do things like this again in the future. You’re in danger, Successor-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why am I in danger?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You might face retaliation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It doesn’t even hurt though? You said it was like tickling.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, you can’t know this sensation without experiencing it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those two successors who will never have to experience it directly, and who are even innocent, probably have no idea what it’s like.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I endure it because I’m not ignorant, but…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If young students mistakenly experienced this, they might misinterpret this sensation as sexual desire toward their opponent and cause trouble…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, Yang Pyo. Anyway, we got it. Mission successful.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not! Don’t include me as an accomplice!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry, but you are an accomplice. The only thing you’re not an accomplice to is the Kim Sang-ju matter!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If, if I’m an accomplice, then hyung, you’re guilty of fraud!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This bastard won’t lose a single word. Did you grow up a lot?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did he even properly listen to the advice? This senseless successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as his tied arms were freed, Choi Jung-do became aware that his gaze was fixed on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s smooth nape. He lowered his eyes, wanting to withdraw his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After handing over all the desired data and sending Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Yang Pyo back out the window, Choi Jung-do resolved to hurry up and sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One day in June, a document was submitted to the Association under Ja Hyeong-woo’s name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire was lit, and the situation unfolded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ja Hyeong-woo press conference [235]
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  I knew this would happen, that’s what schools are like [732]
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Getting backstabbed after promoting kids as hunters; are you coming to your senses? [588]
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Are any successors involved? [390]
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On all bulletin boards of portal sites, posts that had been discussing individual successors or stages were all pushed out. Aggressive posts filled the boards completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All of South Korea’s news was in an uproar covering the unsavory incident within Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to the aftermath, all successors’ training was temporarily suspended. Each successor entered a period of self-restraint, monitoring and controlling their subordinate regular hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was uniquely free since he had no faction to speak of, sought out Hae Mi-jun first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, the news just broke, are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m fine, but that…! Can I call you back in a bit?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice kept cutting out. It seemed like he was running somewhere urgently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For Hae Mi-jun to hang up on him first, it must be quite a serious incident.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s wrong with you? What happened?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“There’s a fight at the water attribute regular hunters’ training ground! They say Ha Gwon-yeong hunter attacked a middle school kid, so I’m going to check it out!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, those rotten bastards wouldn’t quietly end things without incident. Gyeon Gang-hyeon sighed silently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll come too. See you there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“H-hyung? It’s dangerous!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s dangerous? Just tell me the training ground number.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The water attribute dormitory, which faced the biggest storm with all the talk and trouble, was quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only whispered phone conversations echoed from all directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah Mom. I’m really fine, okay? It’s nothing serious. There were just some weird seniors…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine, Grandma… The news just got blown up a bit. No, I wasn’t hit. I’m a hunter too, so why would I get hit? Don’t worry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Other middle school hunters who had been lazily sprawled on their beds for once were also busy with their fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Hey, did Ja Hyeong-woo-nim come to you too?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Yeah, he even apologized to us… Seriously, Ha Gwon-yeong can go die, that bastard]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [He already looks like he’s dying ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Even his friends are all fucked]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [They lost money and got on the Association blacklist ㅎㄷㄷ]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [But has anyone seen Yoon Cha-on? Why isn’t he answering? He should be the happiest about Ha Gwon-yeong being screwed]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Oh right, Cha-on]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much Hunter School had entered an unsettled rest period.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gates that always occurred unpredictably and threatened citizens never considered timing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, even now, a gate might suddenly appear somewhere in Korea. Someone had to be prepared to be dispatched at any time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [But did you see that? Ha Gwon-yeong got removed from the gate roster too]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Seems like the system recognized this incident too;; kinda creepy]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Wasn’t the system originally not caring about kids’ personalities, being merit-based to the bone]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Did you see the gate reserve team 3 roster? Ha Gwon-yeong’s name is gone and do you know which healer got in?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  […That’s Cha-on?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the roster that the middle school hunter glimpsed wasn’t wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on would become the first regular hunter from Hae Mi-jun’s group to be selected for gate conquest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite Hae Mi-jun’s order to stay in his dorm room, Yoon Cha-on couldn’t calm his mind and had come out to the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s empty.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was natural since he’d come out alone without permission despite the training suspension order.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this vast communal training ground, he recalled how dominantly Ja Hyeong-woo’s subordinate hunters had occupied space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How Yoon Cha-on and his colleagues from Hae Mi-jun’s group had been ostracized and trained in corners.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you guys training for? You won’t even get to see real combat.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “These bastards have it easy~. While Ja Hyeong-woo-nim’s kids work to death as healers, they just get to ride the bus.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But do you know what?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Ja Hyeong-woo successor-nim also fumbled in his first battle, but our Hae Mi-jun successor-nim did his full part without any hesitation in his first real stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So I can do that too. I’ve trained to death too, and I’ve prepared by watching tons of combat videos.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on ran combat simulations with VR in the training ground he seemed to have rented out alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Next time a gate opens, I’m really going in.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regular hunters operated on a performance system. Simply put, counting gate dispatch frequency and measuring pay using the system’s calculation method.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As someone who had never achieved any performance until now, Yoon Cha-on felt the joy inside him overwhelming even his nervousness. His heart fluttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hae Mi-jun successor-nim’s healing focuses on stamina recovery rather than treating injuries. So if I get hurt, rather than treating it, I should get stamina recovery first. Making colleagues fly around energetically so they don’t get hurt in the first place.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while going through the healer combatant manual one by one, he was full of anticipation rather than pressure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If a healer catches a monster’s attention and gets in danger, it can trouble colleagues, so stealth is essential. Moving without falling behind, protecting myself while keeping a wide field of vision…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Preparing mentally for colleagues in the same team to ignore him for being from Hae Mi-jun’s group… maybe he doesn’t need to do that anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even at this moment, all kinds of articles are noisily expressing sympathy for Hae Mi-jun’s subordinate hunters who had been oppressed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on was wearing VR equipment on his head, so he didn’t hear someone entering the training ground doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…That bastard looks like Yoon Cha-on.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He also couldn’t hear Ha Gwon-yeong muttering aloud with insane eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shortly after, BANG! An ominous loud noise echoed inside the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep, beep—! The system inside the training ground sounded an alarm. The school’s internal system prohibited PK, or fighting, between hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Worthless bastard. You think you’re getting into gates because you’re good?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fallen VR rolled on the floor. Fallen Yoon Cha-on looked up at his opponent while wiping blood from his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he reacted immediately upon sensing presence behind him, he couldn’t completely avoid Ha Gwon-yeong’s fist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If the news hadn’t broken this time, I wouldn’t have been dropped from the gate team. You’re just sitting in an empty seat. Are you excited thinking you’re something? A Hae Mi-jun lackey?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Yoon Cha-on stood up, he thought. Ha Gwon-yeong, this bastard, got exposed as the main bully and cursed at, did he lose his mind?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he should be lying low like dead, he comes out like he has no tomorrow and beats people up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong’s muscular arms writhed. Driven to the edge, he seemed to have no rationality left to control his strength against a middle schooler.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s really pissing me off is that there are tons of people to heal you, so even if I break your arm or stab your belly, dispatch won’t be canceled, fuck.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on sighed inwardly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though his opponent was crazier than expected, he somehow wasn’t scared. Maybe because he realized that bastard Ha Gwon-yeong was truly pathetic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he was alone with Ha Gwon-yeong right now with no one to help.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong stepped forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I’ll at least plant some fear. A bastard with no real combat experience will be too scared to enter gates if he gets hurt badly enough.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong was hiding a weapon in his pocket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How big is Ha Gwon-yeong, and that crazy bastard is beating up a middle schooler with that build? And there’s no one at the training ground to stop him?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who barely arrived in front of the water attribute training ground, panted breathlessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun arrived first by a hair’s breadth. But he wasn’t going in, just standing at the doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When he should be rushing in immediately, why is he standing there dazed?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Gyeon Gang-hyeon realized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The situation inside the training ground was the opposite of what Gyeon Gang-hyeon had expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crazy bastard. I’m better at physical fighting than you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ha Gwon-yeong was lying face down with that large body, unable to move at all. Completely subdued by a much smaller middle schooler, he was pinned down in a joint lock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “While you were acting cocky relying only on your water ability and entering gates, I had nothing to do during that time so I did tons of solo training, you fucking bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tears dripped from the eyes of Yoon Cha-on, who was gritting his teeth and spitting out words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun had been standing there dumbfounded after seeing exactly that scene.
 </span>
