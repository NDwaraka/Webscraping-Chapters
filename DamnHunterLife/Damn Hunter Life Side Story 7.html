  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 7
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today is Tuesday, so it’s the day Han Hyeong-woo goes to his certification academy. I was originally supposed to go to the library today, but I just decided not to go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I can study at home during the morning hours while Han Hyeong-woo is at the academy, then prepare lunch and wait for Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat at the dining table and waited, then Han Hyeong-woo brought out breakfast. Salmon salad, toasted bread, and some kind of clam soup with tomato sauce as the base…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo kept insisting he made something really simple, but I didn’t believe him at all since I saw him add white wine to the clam soup earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he must be the hungriest, Han Hyeong-woo always waits for me to take the first bite before he follows. Today too, he was ardently watching me take a spoonful of the tomato stew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How does it taste? I changed the original recipe a little.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s delicious.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Han Hyeong-woo start eating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right from this moment, I can raise my gaze straight ahead and enjoy watching Han Hyeong-woo’s eating show. Then when I come to my senses, the food in my bowl will have been completely finished by me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He desperately loves eating, and he has someone he wants to feed. Han Hyeong-woo has come to love cooking even more than I thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m really glad he found another aptitude besides following me around. When he lived at the shaman’s house, he said he always made similar food just out of obligation, so he probably didn’t have the leisure to discover this kind of aptitude back then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who tasted the stew, furrowed his brow slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm… It’s a little greasy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think it’s delicious.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I replied curtly, then thinking about it a little later, since Han Hyeong-woo wants to improve his cooking skills, I probably shouldn’t just say good things unconditionally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, it might taste better with a bit more pepper and less garlic…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Han Hyeong-woo smiled brightly. I bit my lip slightly and just ate the stew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After saying it was greasy, the guy who scraped up every bit of stew with bread tried to ladle more remaining stew into my bowl first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eat more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But my stomach was already full. I put my hand over the bowl to defend against his ladle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No… I’ve eaten a lot already.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You need to bulk up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is already an upward trend.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The argument continued quite intensely. Han Hyeong-woo suddenly grabbed my hand with a serious face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t understand my feelings. At night, I just suck my fingers while watching you sleep exhausted. I get nervous even while fucking you. I feel like I might break you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, that’s why I’m doing my best too! In various… meanings.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I argue with that pervert bastard, I surprisingly lose. I screamed and turned my face away, feeling like it would turn red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you attacked me a little less, I would have gained more weight already.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I absolutely didn’t say this out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While doing the dishes after breakfast, suddenly Han Hyeong-woo’s arms smoothly wrapped around me from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely held back a scream that almost came out. Han Hyeong-woo covered my upper belly with his palm and gently stroked it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he had fed me a hearty breakfast, my stomach was sticking out a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your belly’s sticking out here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pleased touch moved down a little below my navel. My body shivered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I like it when your lower belly sticks out too. Do you know when that happens?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When mine goes inside, it bulges.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I kicked his shin with my heel. Han Hyeong-woo fell back without much impact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aren’t you going to the academy soon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo slyly grabbed my foot, then knelt down and kissed my toes. So I seriously kicked him in the solar plexus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After kicking him out, the house became a good space for concentration. I listened to math lectures without leaving my desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m aiming for university admission next year. Later, I’m thinking of slowly getting Han Hyeong-woo to prepare for the college entrance exam too and getting him into hotel culinary arts or food nutrition. He seems to have no head for studying, so I’ll have to make it a long-term project.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During break time, I chatted with Sa Ye-ho on video call. Maybe because he’s a broadcaster, Sa Ye-ho preferred video calls over regular phone calls.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What major are you going for?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Computer science.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Were you a science student?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho suddenly looked at me as if I was a stranger. His eyes even showed a sense of betrayal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t need to get good grades, just learn something I’m curious about.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just then, ding, a notification appeared at the top of my phone. It was a text Han Hyeong-woo sent during his academy break time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said another student tried to talk to him but he ignored them all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I happened to mention it to Sa Ye-ho in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What should I do about Han Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Why?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a big problem because he only wants to hang out with me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t quite worry, but it was something I was secretly concerned about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also like hanging out with Han Hyeong-woo, but this is a somewhat different problem. Manager Park Yoon-seok brings his son around saying he’s my age, I keep in contact with the successor kids, and I make acquaintances at the entrance exam academy, but Han Hyeong-woo only has me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you retire and come out, you should take Han Hyeong-woo around with you. At least he’s okay with you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s expression immediately soured.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The fuck is okay about it? That bastard is so boring I can’t be around him!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I find him interesting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho couldn’t continue and just stared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “His only flaw is that he only has that in his head?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now he made a face like he didn’t want to hear and covered his ears with his palms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I was always the one in the position of covering my ears, seeing Sa Ye-ho do that was quite amusing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But it is a bit much. That bastard Han Hyeong-woo keeps trying to make me herbal medicine and feed me things that are good for virility – is he really crazy?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who returned from the academy, came home and hugged me tightly, enjoying our reunion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I fidgeted in his arms, then pointed with my foot to a delivery box next to the entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your package came.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A little later, Han Hyeong-woo carried something like a big barbecue container to the garden with an expectant face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That crazy bastard brought a sous vide machine and a smoker into our house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, Han Hyeong-woo’s second hobby and occupation besides cooking is tending the fairly spacious garden attached to the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s spring, he’s just now planting seedlings in the vegetable garden. I swayed in the hammock where Han Hyeong-woo had seated me, watching the guy work crouched down showing his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why does that suit him so well?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s a straw hat Han Hyeong-woo bought with a serious expression sometime ago. That old-fashioned guy thinks he absolutely must wear that hat when tending the field. There’s one on my head right now too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While it just looks like a prop when I wear it, Han Hyeong-woo pulling weeds while wearing that looks like a natural farmer. He’s built to use his strength well anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also crouched down beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There are earthworms.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I guess it’s because the soil is healthy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We put our heads together and looked at the bugs. When Han Hyeong-woo dug holes and moved seedlings, I covered them with soil, kneading it with my hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I went back to the hammock to rest while Han Hyeong-woo finished the remaining work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had taken off his straw hat, pulled up his t-shirt and smelled it. His expression wasn’t bad, so it seems there was no sweat smell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who pulled his clothes back down looking relieved, approached me. When he sat on the edge of the hammock, the center of gravity tilted toward that side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body naturally leaned to one side. In an instant, our bodies were pressed together. Han Hyeong-woo cupped my cheek with his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I heal you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My breath caught. My heart started beating strangely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I was no longer an awakened one, those words had now become our private terminology.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I didn’t say anything like I was cornered, Han Hyeong-woo smiled slyly and brought his lips to mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smack, smooch, the sucking sounds stretched long in my ears. It was humiliating, but I yielded to the stimulation. Just a little stirring inside my mouth and my body completely changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hand slowly moved down along my chest. I was so absorbed in the kiss that I didn’t realize in time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, a breeze came into my crotch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hastily pulled my lips away and checked below.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much it was a garden surrounded by walls, it was still windy outdoors. But Han Hyeong-woo had pulled down my pants here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had gone down under the hammock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, no, don’t.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should stop him, but with his hot hand gripping the base of my cock, I couldn’t move at all. My thighs trembled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What if someone passes by and hears? Next to the wall…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He pretended not to hear and pulled my cock out of my underwear. Against the backdrop of the blue sky, my cock receiving sunlight was damn glistening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo’s eyes flashed as if looking at something appetizing. His eyes had already rolled back, and even if a hundred people pulled him from behind, he would never give up doing this now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You just need to be quiet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy who whispered that bullshit so sweetly finally brought his mouth to my cock and gently licked up once with his tongue. Then he swallowed it whole.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My waist reflexively bounced up. I swallowed empty air while covering my mouth with my hand. My face contorted mercilessly.
 </span>
</p>
