 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One year ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Please tell the world about your current situation. Tell those who criticize Gang-hyeon that you’re this hurt, that you’re carrying such a burden.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Manager Park Yoon-seok pleaded several times. Because he could no longer bear to watch Gyeon Gang-hyeon writhing on the floor screaming in agony from the pain burning his entire body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok felt sorry. Wasn’t it too cruel to call this punishment just for missing awakening?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This young man hiding his pain, enduring criticism from countless people, and choosing to be alone to push away even the only person who had lingering feelings for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, don’t tell them. Ja Hyeong-woo can’t know…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The scene blurred and changed to a different background. Unlike before, it was an utterly peaceful atmosphere. Ja Hyeong-woo in the pavilion poured out harsh words with a fierce face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you hadn’t made that stupid mistake back then… It’s all your fault. If only you had been in the strategy team, if only you had awakened, others wouldn’t have had such a hard time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a day like any other, something that always happened. The bitter words Ja Hyeong-woo gave daily to the fine – no, seemingly fine – Gang-hyeon during the day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Why am I recalling both Gang-hyeon before possession and myself after possession together? The former isn’t something I experienced.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s probably because I wish all the time he suffered in the past could become nothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t suffer even if he learned this fact later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even so… they say there’s no such thing as an eternal secret.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When that past is revealed to the world, and you, Ja Hyeong-woo, learn Gang-hyeon’s secret…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Will you be able to not blame yourself?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fireballs constantly fell to the ground. The crimson rain of fire endlessly pounded the surface of the solidly made earth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  News from below could never be known from above ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A temporarily impregnable bunker had been created.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A cave made by forcibly piercing through earth. This space barely continued to exist through the harmony of four attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo repaired the earthen cave that was trying to crumble from the edges. Myo Cho-hui bloomed fresh branches and green leaves to purify the air and awaken her comrades’ spirits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon familiar flying through the sky and stirring the earth traveled between above and below ground, bringing as much fresh air as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Each time new air was supplied, it was inevitable that scorching hot heat would rush in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Hae Mi-jun’s role was to draw out clear water before that heat reached the team members.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was supposed to switch with Ja Hyeong-woo if it became too much, but Hae Mi-jun continued his role sitting steadily even with his trembling body. His head was dizzy and his mouth completely parched. It felt like all the water in his body was being stolen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is my job. Right now, what I can do for Gang-hyeon hyung…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To keep the most excellent healer completely attached to Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beyond the earthen cave, the white figure lying on the floor painfully rippled in Hae Mi-jun’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The urgent movements of several people surrounding him. Soon the entire visible scene twisted painfully. Hae Mi-jun squeezed his eyes shut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then opened them again. At the weight of the heavy palm placed on his shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Yang Pyo hyung.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time their leader breathed heavily behind him, Yang Pyo also jumped. But in his own way, as an adult, he tried to comfort Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Huff*… Hae Mi-jun let out a deep sigh. Soon, straight eyes were revealed between his eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when violent panting that sounded like retching something up rang out from behind, both Yang Pyo and Hae Mi-jun, everyone in that place, had to freeze again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While thinking he was afraid to look back, Hae Mi-jun was looking back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The owner of the rustling white clothes had somehow sat up. It wasn’t voluntary. He couldn’t support his upper body despite the several hands supporting him. Unable to turn his head, he continued spitting bloody fluid onto Ja Hyeong-woo’s clothes. Just like he had done above ground earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s eyes met with Jin Seol-woon’s, who was holding the white clothes from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Reason suddenly returned to Jin Seol-woon’s eyes that had been equally twisted in mess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking straight at Hae Mi-jun, Jin Seol-woon raised one hand. An earthen wall rose in front of Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The spaces on this side and that side were completely divided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t even realize that younger team members had been watching this scene. Sweat beaded on his temples as he supported Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the appearances of Gang-hyeon he’d seen so far sliced his heart too violently with a knife, feeling like it would never close again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And something more desperate than all of that combined was happening in the pale body he was supporting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pain of all blood vessels burning. Yet a body that was only cold. Hands and feet stiffening from lack of blood circulation. Eyes that fully revealed pain and fear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “By now it should be calming down…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s muttering as if he’d definitely experienced such nightmares before was only until a moment ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after vomiting blood, dry heaves followed as if his breath would stop. Even while Jin Seol-woon hugged him from behind and held his hair, even while Ja Hyeong-woo placed his hands to heal his stomach, the thin body struggled painfully. With each retch, his life seemed to crumble too rapidly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had squeezed his eyes shut, unconsciously muttered “Stop…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, is there really improvement?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who brought warm water, sat down with a thump, his red hair fluttering. Unlike his fierce words, his fingertips that couldn’t do anything trembled finely as they grasped at empty air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among no one answering, the convulsions finally stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after vomiting all the blood inside, his breathing didn’t return. His chest rose and fell too rapidly. Ja Hyeong-woo forcibly gripped his chin and made Gang-hyeon lift his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dazed face was a mess, covered with tears and blood. The blood vessels in the whites of his eyes had all burst, red spreading through his eyes. Ja Hyeong-woo raised his voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeon-ah, Gang-hyeon! Look at me. Breathe the same as me. Breathe slowly!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He did his best in case shock came or he fainted. He continued shouting patiently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s okay, try it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he didn’t get better in time, Ja Hyeong-woo was planning to press his lips together and forcibly blow air in as an emergency measure. Gang-hyeon regained consciousness first. Even while gasping, he struggled to push oxygen into his lungs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Slowly bear with it, breathe in and out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After several attempts, Gang-hyeon’s breathing returned. Then the cold and pain he’d forgotten struck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ahhh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A thin cry like an animal leaked out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon drew in breath. His heart hurt as if he’d received an injury that wouldn’t let him stand. Unconsciously he tried to pull his body toward him, to put him in his embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But from the front, he discovered Ja Hyeong-woo with reddened eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This person had received a shock that made the world collapse. His heart was completely broken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon shedding tears from pain was, in other words, this person’s matter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon felt a feeling at that moment that was hard to resist, making all of him seem powerless. In the end, with his own hands… he handed Gang-hyeon over to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he’d been waiting, Ja Hyeong-woo pulled the dry body into his embrace. The powerless head dropped onto Ja Hyeong-woo’s shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry. Gang-hyeon… Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he wasn’t crying, he called out intermittently as if crying together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo brought water to the reddened mouth. He had him rinse his mouth and drink a little. Meanwhile, he took off the outer clothes that had become red like Gang-hyeon’s. Only the black undergarment remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon, go over there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you to go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo glanced at Jin Seol-woon a couple times while settling the exhausted Gang-hyeon in his arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t delay any longer. Ja Hyeong-woo pressed his lips over Gang-hyeon’s closed mouth and blew air in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was why he’d given him time to avoid the scene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had already escaped before the two lips touched. Jin Seol-woon, who had been momentarily stunned, also slowly stood up from his spot belatedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Is it an illness that gets better by recovering yang energy? From a healer’s perspective.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t surprised by that question either. Since Gang-hyeon had previously given him a hint that not only Sa Ye-ho but Jin Seol-woon also knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It’s not for you to step forward.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know. I was rejected.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally surprising Ja Hyeong-woo, his expression was extremely calm and his eyes dry and tasteless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fortunate. That there’s someone Gang-hyeon allows.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Jin Seol-woon left, he would block others from entering inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s eyes, who had barely fallen asleep in pain, were fully furrowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo repositioned Gang-hyeon so his head rested against his left shoulder. With one arm holding Gang-hyeon, he moved his other arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under the blanket they shared, after pulling down his pants, he exposed his member and stimulated it with his palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He could avoid his colleagues’ eyes for now, and Gang-hyeon had blocked live broadcasting… but recording still happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meaning the association would watch the stage video to check what had occurred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Knowing this, Ja Hyeong-woo sucked Gang-hyeon’s lips and gave him saliva. His other hand moved diligently below.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had been a while since doing this. His body moved familiarly, but he’d never wanted to do it again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He never wanted to see Gang-hyeon in pain again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having to masturbate in front of a sick kid lying down. Self-loathing surged. It was a different sensation from shame. The emotion mixed with depression was a bit closer to anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he desperately recalled it. That time when they kissed together and rubbed their members against each other while moaning together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Going further, he imagined a fantasy-like future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon no longer in pain, having shaken off the hesitation in his heart, accepting his confession. Sleeping side by side in one bed and waking up, spending every day together. And naturally other things too…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite the terribly poor environment, the thing under the blanket was barely taking on dense body heat, when Gang-hyeon opened his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pale eyes looked at Ja Hyeong-woo. Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand stopped abruptly. He also quickly pulled his lips away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, that’s…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow feeling like he’d committed a crime and panicking, Gang-hyeon just stared at him blankly, making it unclear what he was thinking. His lips, pale from pain, twitched, then his mouth slowly opened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon said something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
