  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 122
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Of course, this isn’t something I witnessed directly myself, but I’ve kept the testimonies from those who were around at the time and am simply relaying them to you as they were. If you feel any dizziness, nausea, or other abnormal symptoms while listening, please let me know immediately.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I got it, so hurry up already.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok’s excessive caution was starting to feel frustrating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The prodding seemed to work, as the information I’d been waiting for finally started leaking out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This was before the Stage System was fully activated as it is now, when the successors were handling all the gates that had appeared in Korea.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Much earlier than the original story’s timeline.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buildings destroyed by gates, lives taken away. This was when the government had just started promoting the successors as heroes to contain the chaos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors back then weren’t even newbies—they were at about the level of eggs. Yet even that was better than other countries’ situations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Among the early successors, Woo Sae-geon, Ja Hyeong-woo, Myo Cho-hui, and Sa Ye-ho had all awakened. Only Gang-hyeon remained… Based on the energy flowing from him, it was estimated that Gang-hyeon’s awakening was also imminent.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Gyeon Gang-hyeon of that time must have been full of optimism. He probably thought his awakening was just a bit late because he was the Dog, one of the later numbers in the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Then one day, Gang-hyeon said that if he was deployed in actual combat, he might awaken faster. Ja Hyeong-woo tried to dissuade him, but… despite that, he went into the gate together with him.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm… Yes. I did do that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being stubborn is just like me. Maybe that’s why I possessed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I threw in appropriate responses here and there, giving off the impression that I sort of remembered bits and pieces. If I acted like I didn’t know anything at all, Park Yoon-seok might find it strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The gate was full of monsters, and as you know, crisis struck. Coincidentally, Gang-hyeon really did experience his awakening at that moment. They say when successors awaken, the Status Window speaks to them. Gang-hyeon also had a conversation with the Status Window.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the day I awakened while chasing after Ja Hyeong-woo in the Busan gate, the Status Window had spoken to me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok in the video call screen checked my complexion once more before saying his next words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“But Gang-hyeon apparently screamed things like ‘No, I can’t do it.’ According to Ja Hyeong-woo’s testimony. Since monsters were charging at them right then, he thought Gang-hyeon had gotten scared seeing the monsters. Gang-hyeon ended up running away, leaving only Ja Hyeong-woo alone among the monsters. Fortunately, he was unharmed.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok closed his mouth. After a few seconds of silence, I raised my eyebrows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes. That’s why I told you my knowledge is limited.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The scope of information Park Yoon-seok knew was extremely narrow. And vague.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So in the end, the only person who properly knows about that time is Ja Hyeong-woo… alone?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An anxious heartbeat arose from behind my ribs. I exhaled deeply through my nose, settling the foreign sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How could I ask that bastard about it? Absolutely impossible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I’ll have to make inferences based on this insufficient information…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That sneaky bastard Status Window might have snatched away the opportunity and sent someone to hell just because he got momentarily scared and said he couldn’t do it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a reasonably logical guess. I’d experienced the Status Window’s high-handed behavior and nastiness several times before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But were the monsters really that scary? Scary enough to give up awakening in that moment? I can handle it fine now, so was he more pathetic than me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about after that? He failed to awaken, I was drinking heavily… did he mention anything during that time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hmm… there is something that comes to mind. But this is what he said when he was drunk and not thinking clearly. When Gang-hyeon was drunk, there were times when he… didn’t act like himself.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Manager Park Yoon-seok seemed to be euphemistically referring to the record of causing trouble in the training ground and passing out drunk, or hurling insults at students he encountered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he said that wasn’t like me? I’m still a troublemaker now though?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok then told me a few more words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And after hearing those words, I frowned in confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words that Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had gotten so drunk he couldn’t even tell that his phone conversation partner was Manager Park Yoon-seok, had babbled while crying his eyes out:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I shouldn’t awaken. I couldn’t help it either…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it an excuse that a completely wasted drunk had blurted out, unable to withstand others’ criticism? Had he beautified and distorted his own mistake?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But what if it’s not that? What if there was something more to the original Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s awakening?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The point is this: No one completely knows the moment when Gyeon Gang-hyeon failed to awaken, and only Gyeon Gang-hyeon himself knows the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gained nothing and only ended up feeling disturbed for no reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt strange. I should have thought about this more, but not long after, my phone rang again, breaking my train of thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Sa Ye-ho]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially given who was calling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hey hey hey hey. I heard our next shoot is at a water park?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What, that Hero broadcast thing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first I thought this bastard was talking nonsense out of nowhere. Thinking about it again, Sa Ye-ho was the only successor who communicated with the external broadcast team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, it was real.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The broadcast team was really planning a summer special resort shoot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But we can’t leave the school, so don’t tell me they want to build a resort inside the school?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“They already built it. In front of my house.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They built a swimming pool? Are you out of your mind?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“They built changing rooms, an outdoor bath, and a wave pool too~”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No way, when I went to Sa Ye-ho’s house yesterday, there was nothing like that. What kind of upheaval happened overnight?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The system must have charged an arm and a leg for it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Where did all the points come from?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Sae-geon hyung took it from the magic stones we have to give to the association and provided the budget. This is association money.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh really?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once I learned the source of the money, my anxiety rapidly subsided. I responded indifferently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then you should have built more. You should have made a lazy river, diving boards, and water slides too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Budget exceeded.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What it means to deliver magic stones to the association is that the school members give a certain amount of magic stones to the Hunter Association and government in exchange for them accommodating the hunters’ convenience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In principle, objects inside the gate where Hunter School is located cannot be taken outside, except for the clothes and equipment the hunters are wearing and some items in their inventory. Except for one specific function when used.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And that function is the ‘Hunter Shop Export Rights’ that the school’s owner, the Twelve Zodiac leader, possesses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now, Woo Sae-geon had been delivering magic stones collected from stages to the association through this function.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But it’s more surprising that Woo Sae-geon allowed this. Did he change when he was about to die (retire)?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hyung has been working the kids hard lately, so he’s trying to give them rest time. Even though cameras are rolling, you can lie on sun beds and stuff to relax.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho chattered as if he was moved, but my view is a bit different. What a cheapskate. He could just give them some rest, but he’s using broadcast filming time for it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re just filming the kids lying around and resting? Will that make for good footage?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Looking at you worrying about footage, I was right to trust you. You and I can carry it.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so, in the still hot late summer, all the successors gathered at ‘Ye-ho Water Park.’ It was for filming, but even Woo Sae-geon was there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors’ outfits were varied. There were people like Woo Sae-geon wearing hanbok as usual, and guys like Yang Pyo who seemed to have swimwear under their regular clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Hae Mi-jun. Hae Mi-jun came dressed in a rash guard from the start, carrying a tube. Well, he’s at an age where just seeing water would excite him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was that with a face full of anticipation for water play, instead of jumping into the water right away, he was following me around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was troublesome because it was so obvious what he was expecting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung, are you going to swim? I’ll pull the tube for you!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t planning to go in. If I get wet, it’ll be obvious how skinny I am…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when Hae Mi-jun was looking at me with sparkling eyes, I couldn’t tell him I wasn’t going in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I patted Hae Mi-jun’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright. I’ll do some filming with Sa Ye-ho for the opening part first. Wait here and look around until then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The filming space was incredibly spacious. The swimming pool itself was quite large, plus Sa Ye-ho had opened up his house in the back. That bastard’s arboretum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So if they put their minds to it, the ten successors could hide away alone without running into anyone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And as expected, they’re still not close enough to play in the water together casually, so more than half are doing their own thing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But since Sa Ye-ho and I were there, there was no need to worry about the broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The opening of the summer special &lt;The Hero&gt; begins with the attention-seeker and troublemaker putting their heads together to scheme about the mission they received from the broadcast team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That mission was to go mess with each of the members except for us two, one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We started with role assignments. Who would go to whom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll take Sae-geon hyung, Cho-hui noona, Yang Pyo, and Cheon-a.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho muttered while drawing lines in his notebook.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Puppy can go to Seol-woon, Ha-ri, Mi-jun, and Ja Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grimaced. Do I really have to take on Ja Hyeong-woo? I’m uncomfortable with that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Sa Ye-ho giggled and said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re being picky because it’s a broadcast, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, what the… Are you crazy? People will misunderstand!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard is the one throwing around crazy talk because it’s a broadcast. I was so upset I could die, I could barely speak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fine, I’ll endure it because it’s a broadcast. There’ll be rumors of discord with Ja Hyeong-woo. I calmed down and moved on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Grumbling, I looked through the mission list provided by the broadcast team.
 </span>
