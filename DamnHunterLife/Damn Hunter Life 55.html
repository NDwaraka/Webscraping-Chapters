 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I said about seeing skills is different from the commonly thought visible skill effects (like the blue light of Ja Hyeong-woo’s heal).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s more like the detailed flow of qi, you could say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know why I have this function. Is it because I’m a possessor who recognizes the concept of the original work?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: If skills were people, while others only see the outer skin, I feel like I can see through to the blood vessels?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking back in time, it seems I’ve been using my ability since I first taught Hae Mi-jun how to operate water attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason I realized this relatively recently, despite it being quite a while ago, is first that I didn’t know much about this world. I learned the common sense that qi flow is in the realm of ghosts, or souls, so it’s not visible through cameras, video screens, etc., a bit late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In conclusion, it’s natural that I can visually gauge the connection between familiars of different attributes and their masters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When a successor uses a certain skill, if I memorize its unique form, from then on I can distinguish what skill that successor is using just by looking at the flow. Also, since this ability is fundamentally the ability to see ‘qi,’ I can tell what condition a successor is in now, whether their energy is twisted or not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: But what’s the use of seeing it? I can’t use it myself.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let’s not reveal any more. Just up to here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The five figures standing among the monster corpses fell silent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The silence didn’t last long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s find the boss first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon reminded us of what we needed to do immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If everyone just keeps quiet and only looks at chat, to people watching the recording later, it’ll look like we’re just standing there staring blankly into space doing nothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without anyone taking the lead, we slowly started moving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll guide the way. The distance is far, so we need to ride familiars.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether everyone has questions for me or not, first we follow Myo Cho-hui’s guidance to move to where the boss is located.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon looked around at the other people once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Five people. Three familiars: ox, rabbit, dragon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t seem inclined to ask me anything either. Woo Sae-geon easily counted and decided what me and Ja Hyeong-woo would ride.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can three people ride the Dragon familiar?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon readily nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi is light.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There had been a period when he carried Ja Hyeong-woo behind him before. Now it’s become a scene of Dragon familiar overwork, having to carry me as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon shook its body with a rumble, still seeming healthy despite the hours of continued battle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Ja Hyeong-woo looked back at Jin Seol-woon and asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How do you know he’s light?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can tell just by looking……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Rabbit familiar is small so it can only carry Myo Cho-hui alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Ox familiar…… could easily carry up to five people, but after the rodeo incident, apparently no one dares to try.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for me, who didn’t witness the incident directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to ride the ox.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s eyes went round. The other two pairs of eyes immediately fixed on me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had a face like he was asking if I was crazy, and Jin Seol-woon was more composed than that but…… seemed to be asking if I was in my right mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We should share the load. So the Dragon familiar’s stamina doesn’t run short.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s fine though. Jin Seol-woon muttered, but I only looked passionately at Woo Sae-geon’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ox Successor: Is that a judgment you’re making with your eyes?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I conveyed with my gaze that it was. Even here, I didn’t bother acting thoughtlessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the Dragon familiar is earth attribute, not only I but Woo Sae-geon can also see the form of its energy. While Woo Sae-geon was looking over the dragon, I quickly struck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I ride in back? Or front?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Ride in back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind his expressionless face, I could see Woo Sae-geon’s mood souring, but what can you do? I smiled as cheerfully as someone whose head is in the clouds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I regretted it a bit afterward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ugh.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Ox familiar, once demonic but now tamed by Woo Sae-geon, honestly had terrible riding comfort.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  True to a familiar with violent tendencies, it wasn’t stable and shook wildly like driving on an unpaved road. I had a premonition that my back would be ruined tonight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Woo Sae-geon wanted to mess with me, he couldn’t make only his upper body, where he was sitting, move smoothly while letting only the lower body rattle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Has Woo Sae-geon been riding this the whole time? Doesn’t his back get destroyed?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least his broad back in the scholar’s robe looked nonchalant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The rabbit hopped a bit behind, and Jin Seol-woon drove the dragon on the side. It was as fast as riding a car.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The earlier conversation resumed in chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Mouse Successor: You can only see, but you can’t use other attributes yourself?

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo re-confirming what he already said? Just as I was about to give the same answer again—
 </span>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s chat suddenly appeared in the temporary chat room with five people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……Right, I didn’t think Myo Cho-hui would just stay quiet like this. Since she’s been caught off guard, she’ll hit the back of my head at least once before retreating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Rabbit Successor: You don’t know, do you? Remember when you faced the snake boss? You shot Ha-ri’s metal attribute arrow then.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Rabbit Successor: Normally there should have been a rejection reaction. Right?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though her attitude seemed like she was kindly informing me, it wasn’t cheerful for me at all. I can picture Myo Cho-hui erasing the clear luster from her pupils, intentionally revealing her true nature, and lightly touching my chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My response to that was quick. Before anyone could add their opinions, I quickly struck first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Then do you know this?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: After shooting that arrow, I was bedridden at home.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body is like this, so even if I have abilities, I can’t use them properly. Ah, really, really regrettable. If this ability had been with the leader or Ja Hyeong-woo, they would have used it better than me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Chat messages under my name went down in a row. Well, there wasn’t a single lie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s not just being a scoundrel, but being a scoundrel who has abilities but doesn’t use them is more infuriating!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To prevent the tragedy of becoming Myo Cho-hui’s test subject or Woo Sae-geon’s slave, I diligently laid the groundwork. I even deliberately provoked annoyance by smiling brightly whenever our eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Don’t think about making new weapons with me, just train hard like you have been.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, I’ll go when a really dangerous moment comes. Even if I’m not mentally prepared, I’ll do whatever it takes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m the world’s biggest scoundrel trash. Know me as such.

  Of course, no matter how much I struggle, I won’t be able to avoid a meeting with Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s like sticking my head in a bull’s mouth to avoid a monster rabbit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one thing that could be called Woo Sae-geon’s counter is……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Snake Successor: Ye-ho
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Snake Successor: I might come to your place today
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since you can’t communicate with the outside while in a stage, there was no way Sa Ye-ho would respond immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was looking at the one-on-one chat with Sa Ye-ho when Woo Sae-geon sent a ‘stop’ signal. He extended his arm from the front and made the other familiars stop moving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boss monster was a C-rank mob Homunjjo, but it was damn huge. And it saw us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Scatter!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately the three familiars dispersed in different directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone seemed to smoothly escape as if quickly turning a steering wheel while properly holding onto their familiars, but……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t. Even though I held on tight with both thighs, at the same time another part of myself was already foreseeing the future. Me slipping and falling behind from on top of the ox.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strong hands grabbed me tight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the ox that was moving as wildly as a bucking bronco, Woo Sae-geon tucked me under his arm and shouted while avoiding the wind caused by the large boss monster’s wing beats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who looked small because he was high in the air, turned the dragon’s head. Immediately the dragon flew toward us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the two familiars brushed past each other, Woo Sae-geon literally threw me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But whether there was a slight miss or even this was teamwork, the dragon’s head swept past me. As its long body passed by like an earthquake—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who was in the back, caught me. Despite being a healer, Ja Hyeong-woo displayed amazing arm strength, body-checking me yet not falling off the dragon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was just breathing in Ja Hyeong-woo’s arms, swallowing the intense shock, the remaining four handled the boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dozens of vines grew from the ground all at once. Myo Cho-hui’s Rabbit familiar caught the Homunjjo so it couldn’t fly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It won’t last long!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since there were many vines, it seems the durability of each individual one was lower. When the Homunjjo screeched metallically and struggled, the vines fell off one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the middle of that, I could see Woo Sae-geon, who had shaken off his burden and freed both hands, driving the ox in a charge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite the long battle, the excellent leader charged with terrifying momentum without showing signs of fatigue. At that sight, I unconsciously relaxed, thinking that I’m really useless and the actual strategy team is just these four people……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……I didn’t immediately understand why Ja Hyeong-woo was suddenly blocking my entire view with his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo put his chin on my head and let out a short groan. Thump, after bouncing once from hitting the ground, our bodies stopped with a long scrape mark on the earth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had fallen from the horse while embracing me and absorbed the full impact of the fall, coughed while pinned under me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grabbed my shaking head tightly and forced myself to look up. In the dizzying vertigo that made me want to vomit, I tried to see the situation somehow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one and only healer had been exposed to attack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When this gets broadcast, people will gossip tremendously in the community.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So whose fault is this?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, who couldn’t bind the Homunjjo sufficiently with vines?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, whose sword strikes were perfect like a downpour, but who couldn’t drive the Homunjjo sufficiently to the opposite side, allowing its tail to move?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who couldn’t avoid the striking tail and let the two in back fall from the dragon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Keeeak—! The Homunjjo cried sharply. A huge shadow fell over me and Ja Hyeong-woo. The tail was striking down once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking straight at it, I thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s my fault.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, the healer, should only heal. You shouldn’t let situations arise where the healer has to face monsters. If such situations arise, then the dealers and tankers of that party are incompetent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, I’m talking about myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy who was supposed to be a tanker originally but was moved to dealer because the conditions didn’t match, yet couldn’t take care of his own body and made the healer embrace and roll with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I’m going to stimulate Ja Hyeong-woo by telling him he’s incompetent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to qualify myself first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No matter how much of a scoundrel I am, I have to do my part.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This damn Ja Hyeong-woo, instead of staying quiet below when hurt, somehow got up again and threw his body over me once more. In panic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that I was somewhat hindered, but I safely gathered my breath and did what I intended to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wheeeet!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put my fingers to my mouth and made a high sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Hyeon-ah, don’t! Then your body will……}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ignored the sobbing young voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the master exercises force, there’s no way for a familiar to disobey. A howling like a wolf’s cry echoed through the area.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Dog familiar, grown massively large, struck the monster with a thunk!
