 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the male students at school enjoyed debating and ranking successors’ combat abilities like game characters, Park Ho-jeong and her friends weren’t very interested in things like battle processes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They’re all working hard……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Their philosophy was ‘Working hard is enough!’ They weren’t particularly concerned about whose skills were good or bad.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s handsome.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They focused on other aspects the successors possessed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first successor Park Ho-jeong encountered was the one associated with rabbit ears, Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When she saw her wearing a hanbok skirt over short pants, she had the twisted curiosity of wondering ‘Did she come to fight or to model hanbok?’ but soon regretted such thoughts. She was trash for daring to doubt Queen Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An idol-like impression, surprising strength and judgment, the successor who perfectly balanced fan service and combat – the best mascot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s how she got into successors, and being naturally weak to handsome men, her interest naturally shifted to the guys too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ho-jeong~ Who attracts you the most?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……The one who’s like a Hwarang?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Based on appearance alone, Ja Hyeong-woo was most to her taste among them. She even kept up with ‘The Heroes’ broadcast. She woke right up whenever Ja Hyeong-woo appeared on screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then she saw this Stage 30 video that came out, and noticed a figure standing with a bow in hand, white hanbok sleeves fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s him. Ja Hyeong-woo’s princess.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Park Ho-jeong was attracted to robust men, conversely Gang-hyeon didn’t catch her eye at all. Maybe because his face carried it well, he looked cool even though he was skinny. That was all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But…… while watching the stage summary edited to focus on the successors’ chemistry, Park Ho-jeong found that figure too often in scenes where Ja Hyeong-woo appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What’s with these two?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the liberal arts professor came in. She hadn’t even watched half yet. Park Ho-jeong reluctantly turned off her phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She and her friend were sitting in the back row. Her friend, who had claimed this seat 30 minutes early, predictably started doing other things on her laptop even before attendance was called.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A Twelve Zodiac fan community. Not an official community, but a place closer to the underground that had split off separately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh, talk shows are nice but I wish they’d film close-contact variety shows…… There’s not much to eat. I’ve become a wanderer searching for fanfiction.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her friend lamented in a small voice while clicking her mouse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it was leader Woo Sae-geon’s influence or they just didn’t mesh well, the successors were still hard to see as having an easygoing relationship. No matter how idol-like they were, they weren’t actually idols…… so it was unavoidable. Relationships weren’t important to them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Twelve Zodiac were people who had to show combat, not relationships with each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-jeong, who had been secretly stealing glances at her friend’s screen, finally pointed to one post.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Guys let’s do Hyeong-woo Gang-hyeon together (Has photos. Lots!)]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The post started with the childhood friend story of the two that had been persistently mentioned since Gang-hyeon was a drunk, and the theory that Ja Hyeong-woo actually liked the other person was getting more absurd by the moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The faintly captured princess-carrying photo from the last Busan Gate would serve as the prologue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gang-hyeon wrapped in vines was a bit close to the monster, Ja Hyeong-woo turned pale and snapped “Myo Cho-hui!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In various screenshots of them riding the Dragon familiar together, Ja Hyeong-woo was hugging him tightly without any apparent discomfort. Gang-hyeon had a slightly uncomfortable expression at first, then soon had a face like he’d given up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was also a scene when they were thrown off, where Ja Hyeong-woo embraced him and groaned from the impact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A bonus was that if you turned up the audio at the moment the monster’s tail struck down, you could hear Ja Hyeong-woo’s scream calling “Gang-hyeon-ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the Dog familiar jumped out and saved them, the gaze that blankly stared at Gang-hyeon, its master.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The flustered appearance upon seeing Gang-hyeon’s nosebleed wasn’t left out either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As carefully written as the post was, both the number of recommendations and comments were overwhelming.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>

  ―The size difference is crazy

  Park Ho-jeong pretended to be unimpressed in front of her friend, saying “Saw it all. Just kinda,” and listened to the professor’s lecture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, she couldn’t really concentrate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When she got home, she ended up joining that community and finding that post to save all the uploaded photos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While strategy videos were released to the general public about a day late, it was different for successors. Other successors who didn’t participate in the strategy could check the strategy much faster than others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone rushed to view the strategy video from different places at unprecedented speed, all to get a look at Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And from the mouths of those watching the video, various reactions burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tch.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah clicked her tongue in dissatisfaction. But somehow, it was caught that she paused the video every time Gang-hyeon’s face appeared on screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wow, this hyung doesn’t even flinch……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo was impressed while burning with rivalry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The nosebleed, it’s not serious……?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri thought she should call Gang-hyeon oppa tomorrow morning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was delighted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Kahahaha. Ah really. Sae-geon hyung’s expression. That bastard Gang-hyeon is really something. Thanks to him I got to see something good?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was enchanted by every Gang-hyeon in the video as if his entire mind had melted, then repeatedly stopped the video for a moment and sighed deeply, overwhelmed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Will there ever come a time when I can be of help to such a person?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while unable to escape from thoughts of Gang-hyeon like this, the truth somewhere that Hae Mi-jun didn’t know was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Gang-hyeon had collapsed on his home floor and was crawling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was that sound I just made mine? Yes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I was alone, my hands and feet froze as if they’d been waiting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The parts that hit the floor when I collapsed were my knees and elbows, but my whole body ached. I felt cold down to my blood vessels, as if ice shards were growing inside my body. It was pain like getting frostbite.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Summoning the Dog familiar had been a big blow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until then it was just body aches for three days and muscle pain for a week.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I opened my mouth, coughs burst out wildly. Inside my solar plexus ached terribly and felt torn. If I vomit, will it come out as blood?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Hyeon-ah, Hyeon-ah!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The puppy rushed over sobbing. I forced my chin to the floor. I looked at Squeaky standing a bit behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Save…… me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Words I absolutely didn’t want to say were coming out of my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The blue boy answered quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I’m sorry. ……Now that I know the method, I’ll treat you more often. From now on, before you hurt.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boy crouched in front of me and reached out his hand. A cool feeling swept over my stomach. The same touch lowered my eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Close your eyes. You’ll be fine when you wake up.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t think of any other way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had somewhat expected it. That he wouldn’t fall asleep easily tonight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The blood spreading on Gang-hyeon’s pale face. After the nosebleed stopped and he turned his back from Ja Hyeong-woo as if hiding from others was enough, his wrists were still trembling slightly even then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was halfway expecting the Mouse familiar to call for him. As soon as he finished the feedback meeting and received the message asking for help, he jumped up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyebrows rose when he teleported and saw what was in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sobok that had gotten dirty in the stage was stripped off and rolling on the floor. The Mouse familiar, the boy, was just about to place Gang-hyeon, wearing only underwear, on the bed while embracing him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why so, improperly……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe he was briefly swept by bewilderment as if someone had struck his heart with a club. Seeing the white, smooth skin, a grumbling remark slipped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse familiar avoided answering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t say that just moments ago, he and the Dog familiar had been trying to move Gang-hyeon and dress him, but the Dog familiar had disappeared frantically at Ja Hyeong-woo’s presence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was still daytime so the room wasn’t dark. Even so, with each step forward, the air in the room seemed to submerge Ja Hyeong-woo deeper into water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t try to put new clothes on Gang-hyeon. He slowly traced with his eyes the skin exposed to the air, so white it looked almost blue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Cold again today. Too much so.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Enough to make the person watching feel like suffocating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That level of action from last time doesn’t seem like it’ll work.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boy showed his master Gang-hyeon and stepped back a little. Ja Hyeong-woo asked directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What should I do to maximize the effect?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {……Direct experimentation.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hesitating boy only said that much. This was an area he didn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo feigned composure while reviewing the information he knew. What actions could give yang energy? Was there something beyond breathing into him?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Breath, water, soul.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The three concepts the boy had suggested.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Can you make sure he doesn’t wake up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Gang-hyeon was in an almost dying state, he probably wouldn’t wake up from most things. Even knowing this, Ja Hyeong-woo asked for confirmation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {If it’s not too rough.}
 </span>
