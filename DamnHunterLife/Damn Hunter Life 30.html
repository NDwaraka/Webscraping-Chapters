  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 30

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were the mouse familiar who had dwelled in Gang-hyeon’s body for a while, he might have realized the reason why Gang-hyeon was losing more life even after awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it because you overexerted yourself at the gate?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boy shook his head. While that influence wasn’t absent, it wasn’t the fundamental cause.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {There are those who possess negative qi and those who possess positive qi in this world.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a theory Ja Hyeong-woo also knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The abilities of Korean successors followed exactly that theory of yin-yang and five elements. The twelve zodiac animals and five natural attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the ‘yin and yang’ of zodiac animals seemed to have no particular effect on skills, so it had been excluded—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar brought this up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Whether yin or yang, one must possess the qi they were born with in neither excess nor deficiency. Especially humans who become successors must have qi commensurate with that.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What he ultimately wanted to say was one thing. The body’s balance. The source that makes blood flow and breath happen, that constitutes a human being.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {But this guy possesses almost none of that energy. He’s close to the dead.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why the moment he truly awakened as a successor, his body conversely collapsed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon must have felt something for sure during the few days after awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed indifferent to his own discomfort. Partly because he firmly believed awakening would cure his sickly body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing it was the opposite.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Ja Hyeong-woo heard those words, his hand covered the small, delicate face. He tried his best to remain calm, but his fingers were already trembling as he repeatedly confirmed the breathing by gently stroking the tip of the nose with his thumb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s the reason? Why did Gang-hyeon become like this? Was he like this from birth?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I don’t know such background.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo bit his lips as he took in Gang-hyeon’s lowered eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He forgot how Gang-hyeon had treated him all this time. Things like how he never smiled at him were pushed to the back of his mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s nothing I can’t do. Tell me if you know a method.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the mouse familiar, the boy, wore a faint bitter smile at the corner of his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {That’s the first command master gives me.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The method the boy suggested was simple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Master should share your energy.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because the explanation was too brief, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t understand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Breathe into him.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He got a clue from seeing what Gang-hyeon did to awaken Hae Mi-jun’s water affinity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar himself had even been used as a test subject by Gang-hyeon beforehand. Thanks to that, he well understood the effects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That successors could share power through acts like exchanging bodily breath, water, soul, and other contacts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s bewilderment didn’t last long. The body temperature touching his fingers was too cold, making all other thoughts fly away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be like artificial respiration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knelt on the floor beside the bed. He immediately pressed his lips gently against Gang-hyeon’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensation of biting something firm and tender. Ja Hyeong-woo’s earlobes reddened slightly from the strange texture that flustered him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he didn’t stop. With his tongue tip, he parted the red entrance, penetrated between the teeth, and filled the inside with his breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The temperature touching the mucous membrane was so, so cold. Finding it excessively pitiful, Ja Hyeong-woo unconsciously moved by instinct.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He pressed down Gang-hyeon’s tongue flat and carefully explored the interior. He swept the even teeth with his tongue and gauged the location of the throat, bumping against the roof of the mouth. As if feeling his way around everywhere, he gently pressed the inner walls and cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had been still no matter what was done, started flinching from then on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmng…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, bodily responses returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Uncomfortable with the sensation of unfamiliar energy penetrating his body, he whimpered in his sleep. He made completely different sounds that just hearing them made strength gather in one’s waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm, uhh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like someone just freed from paralysis, Gang-hyeon twitched. The constantly returning reactions made Ja Hyeong-woo troubled by the thought that he was molesting a sleeping person, but the gradually budding warmth from Gang-hyeon’s body reminded him this act was effective and he forgot about it. The small nasal breathing that began to wheeze touched Ja Hyeong-woo’s nose tip.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t even know his own breathing sounds were filling the room indecently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Saliva rising from under his tongue seeped into Gang-hyeon’s mouth. Ja Hyeong-woo, who quickly found the knack, sucked the soft flesh a bit more strongly. Displaying patience close to enlightenment to avoid interfering with Gang-hyeon’s breathing, he propped his arms on the bed above his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While he couldn’t hear his own gasping breath, he heard only this sound. The ‘gulp’ sound of Gang-hyeon momentarily twitching his throat in his sleep to push out the tongue and swallow the saliva that had flowed in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…Master, that’s enough. It’s sufficient.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo startled and raised his head as if waking from a dream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t guess when he’d lost his mind. He could only be dismayed that the number the minute hand pointed to had changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As he carefully got down from the bed, there was stiffness between his legs. Ja Hyeong-woo arranged the strands of hair that had come loose while openly showing bewilderment on his reddened face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It won’t be permanent, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He asked while wiping Gang-hyeon’s reddened lips with his sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar nodded to tell Ja Hyeong-woo his guess was correct.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I’ll call master whenever needed.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He promised while looking into his eyes. There was no sign of lying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “In other words, you’re saying you’ll voluntarily stay by Gang-hyeon’s side.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t even known that the mouse familiar possessed personality, but it was more surprising that the familiar didn’t particularly refute this statement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had to add his own familiar to the list of those who had penetrated Gang-hyeon’s inner self, besides Hae Mi-jun and Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What method did Gang-hyeon use to influence him…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever it was, he probably treated him more gently and kindly than he does to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The heat had already faded from Ja Hyeong-woo’s face. With a face that had become calm as if nothing had happened just moments before, he fiddled with Gang-hyeon’s hair and turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…When Gang-hyeon wakes up, could you please say this was recovered by your healing ability?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He forgot he could command and expressed it as a request.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s how much he disliked the idea of Gang-hyeon finding out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What psychology that came from—well, Ja Hyeong-woo himself didn’t want to define it. He only knew it was quite a complex emotion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His feet stopped briefly at the doorway. Ja Hyeong-woo looked back at the mouse familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since when has Gang-hyeon been this sick? Don’t you know this either?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A question insistently asking about the duration of illness finally fell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar had met Gang-hyeon relatively recently, so naturally he didn’t know the distant past.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, something he knew from accidentally hearing from a third party.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The time when Gang-hyeon, who failed to awaken, began to touch alcohol.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he was called an alcoholic by everyone, Gang-hyeon was already hiding in his room swallowing pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And even to the only friend who cherished him, Gang-hyeon didn’t reveal it for his sake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A bitter story floated in the mouse familiar’s mind, but his mouth didn’t open easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could master handle Gang-hyeon’s secret that no one in this world acknowledged and only his manager knew?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the other party didn’t answer, Ja Hyeong-woo walked out without lingering. He assumed the mouse familiar wouldn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Left alone with Gang-hyeon, the mouse familiar felt guilt toward that guy for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While brushing the sleeping one’s hair to the side of his forehead, he murmured.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Since I can’t bear to make master cry with my own mouth, when you’re ready, do it yourself.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The morning sunlight warmly enveloped my body. I kicked off the blanket and stretched fully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, I’m late? No wonder the sunlight felt so good.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s murderous gaze waiting for the latecomer was already vivid before my eyes. As I bolted upright, something bounced off my chest with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you? Squeaky.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A blue mouse smaller than my fist rolled over my body and fell between my legs. Soon an annoyed voice was heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {The tardy one is quite noisy too.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Didn’t you go to Ja Hyeong-woo? Did you go and come back? Why did you return?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky replied a bit late, as if the current situation wasn’t welcome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…The way to help master is to monitor you.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit, did Ja Hyeong-woo send you back?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well whatever, regardless of this guy’s intentions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was actually sick yesterday, but I’m fine today. Did you help me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No answer, but it seems right. My head naturally cleared up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though my body wasn’t cured, at least I learned one temporary measure—where is this not good?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Squeaky. You were precious. Since you were gone, I realized your preciousness. Don’t leave me now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Ridiculous talk.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think I’m someone who needs a healer by my side day and night. Even if Ja Hyeong-woo begs for Squeaky back, I absolutely won’t give him up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I went to the training ground (receiving Won Ha-ri’s contemptuous gaze for the latecomer) and tried attribute affinity training again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It works right away!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Earth energy burst out at once. It felt exactly like the training ground floor was being filled with soil starting from me. It was a sensation like actually experiencing moist earth scent and warm sunlight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right, the problem was not having the mouse familiar. That’s why yesterday’s training didn’t go well, and I got dizzy while shooting arrows.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Do you have leisure for other thoughts? Would you like to swing the sword 20 more times?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No! Ah, no.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, just because I got a dedicated healer doesn’t mean my terrible stamina improved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To confirm whether attribute skills really worked well, instead of going to physical training, I headed to another room inside the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Attribute Skill Simulation Laboratory]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This looks like an empty room with nothing in it, but once you enter, the room’s airflow automatically changes according to the registered successor’s attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Most importantly, this room doesn’t transmit shocks to the outside no matter how much chaos you create with skills. And it’s an all-purpose space that even automatically resets the mess when you’re done using it.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soil erupted from beneath my feet. A shockwave stretched like lightning following the direction the sword pointed. Boom—! A tremendous noise rang from the wall that took the direct hit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whew…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My whole body tingled. I dropped the sword and pressed my hand to my chest. My heart was pounding too hard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At least I didn’t vomit blood like last time, but what to do with this frail body.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Click.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sound of a door opening came from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned around, then saw the dark blue clothes filling the doorframe and shut my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…So you are training.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Ja Hyeong-woo. Since he made an irritating soliloquy as soon as he came, I glared at him first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s your business? I have nothing to do with you. I’m even training now, so do you have leisure to do other things? Is this what people call the top healer?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I poured out criticism rapid-fire without giving Ja Hyeong-woo a chance to say anything more behind. That way he’d get sick of me and go train.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, Ja Hyeong-woo, whose words were blocked, looked me up and down a bit more, then suddenly took a step forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? Why are you coming? Stay there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You look fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you wish I wasn’t fine?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After snapping at him, something seemed strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is he suddenly checking if I’m okay?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy stared at me intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those eyes whose intentions I couldn’t grasp seemed to hold the time around me so it couldn’t flow normally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As we stared at each other, I suddenly felt my mind becoming distant, but because I disliked this mysterious feeling, I raised my guard sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Close the door and get out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I deliberately shouted more fiercely. But at that moment, all the soil beneath my feet rumbled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I was concentrating on Ja Hyeong-woo and neglecting to control the soil’s energy, this damn soil attacked Ja Hyeong-woo as if it had developed a will, following my jagged emotions!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait, hey!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing what to do, I reached out my hand, then ran over. If I block with my body first, that should work! I charged intending just to ram into him, then actually collided with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Agh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest was like some cliff face. Ja Hyeong-woo’s arms caught me as I hit my shoulder and was in pain, then because even the ground beneath our feet turned to soil and sank down, we fell together.
