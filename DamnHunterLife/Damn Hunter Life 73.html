  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 73
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first, I remember how I didn’t want to receive healing from Ja Hyeong-woo because my pride was hurt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was foolish then. What did mere pride matter anyway?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I think about it differently, sacrificing just a little of my pride could definitely strengthen Ja Hyeong-woo’s power.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some time after that, it became easier to accept when I concluded that I had to depend on Ja Hyeong-woo anyway to maintain an awakened body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was hopelessly weak, and if I used even one skill wrong, my entire body would be damaged. In stage spaces where others were fine, I was affected just by breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So it was ridiculously simple. Creating situations where Ja Hyeong-woo would heal me during raids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As for who this was for, it wasn’t for me, at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I hate being in pain too. I’m already sick often enough without doing it on purpose.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I did it to help Ja Hyeong-woo. Also for the people whose lives Ja Hyeong-woo had to save.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon, answer me properly. Is it true?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I was completely wrong. Just mistaken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I faced the sight of Ja Hyeong-woo unable to control his emotions and trembling, I realized with my whole body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That I had crossed a line I shouldn’t have crossed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That you think nothing of self-harm, and trained me to that extent… just tell me it’s baseless speculation, that it’s not true.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A voice that couldn’t hide its trembling, breaking up messily, grinding teeth while swallowing down surging emotions again and again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My whole body went cold. Cold enough to feel nothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My brain automatically sought the easy path.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I act nonchalantly and say it’s not true, like Ja Hyeong-woo is pleading… could I get through this moment?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my mouth and took a deep breath. The air hurt going down my throat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to say that several times…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I only felt powerlessness equivalent to kneeling, and just spat out empty air again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t lie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To insist it wasn’t true and escape from here would feel like doing something I really shouldn’t do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I definitely had guilt too. It wasn’t that I felt only joy in deceiving you.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since when.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo understood what the lengthening silence meant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he was speaking much more quietly than before, veins bulged in Ja Hyeong-woo’s neck. Everything visible about Ja Hyeong-woo expressed betrayal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Would it feel better if he just grabbed me by the collar instead?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was harder to watch him suppress his anger without moving a single step from that spot. Even while clenching his fists as if he’d crush his hands, Ja Hyeong-woo still hadn’t exploded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That made it more frightening. Because I could feel that even in this moment, Ja Hyeong-woo was gradually losing his reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Completely losing composure, his vision narrowing extremely to focus only on fragments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “After battles, becoming cold like a dead person… was that on purpose too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? No! That has nothing to do with previous matters!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was the one who couldn’t step back and think. Fighting off dizziness that made my head shake, I desperately shook my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you first awakened and coughed up blood, was all of that planned too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The blood drained completely from my face. If I didn’t keep trying to hold onto my consciousness, I felt like I’d forget to breathe and become dazed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I said I wanted to escape Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze even by turning back time, that would be an irresponsible thought, wouldn’t it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I swear it’s not. Before that, I was really in pain from everything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How can I believe that? You don’t treasure me at all! Don’t I know that my worry has no value to you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My lips automatically bit down at the thunderous shout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I squeezed my eyes shut forcefully a couple times before opening them, then glanced down at the front of my sobok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hey, hey! Squeaky, you. You bastard, aren’t you coming out right now? No matter how wrong I was, this isn’t right! That was a misunderstanding! Come out and properly explain what needs explaining!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {……}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ended up getting angry too. Even though I wasn’t in a position to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To others’ eyes, I probably looked like I’d suddenly gone crazy and was talking to myself like a madman. Even knowing that, I didn’t care at all. The problem was that this crazy rat bastard was ignoring me and staying buried.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw Ja Hyeong-woo moving at the edge of my vision and snapped my head up. He had only moved his arm from the same spot, but because I was too sensitive, I visibly flinched far too much for anyone watching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While staring directly at me like that, Ja Hyeong-woo held his skill item, the gourd, in his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash! I startled for the second time at the sharp shattering sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I opened my tightly closed eyes, the gourd was shattered to pieces below the wall, and Ja Hyeong-woo was holding one large glass shard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still confirming that I was watching him… he stabbed the shard into the center of his chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sight before my eyes became horror that burrowed into my brain nerves, and the heavy sound made nausea rise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood droplets splattered from the glass shard he lifted as if showing me. His torn clothes were instantly stained red. Thwack! A new wound was created next to the already existing wound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing, stop!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo glared at me as if to kill me, as if it was my fault.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to shock you too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Words wouldn’t work. I lunged at the arm holding the shard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even though I desperately clung on, I absolutely couldn’t stop him with strength alone. Thump! That terrible sound came once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I get it, I was wrong! I’ll never do such things again!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know what you should be apologizing for?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Deceiving you, treating my body carelessly…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. You don’t look like you’re reflecting at all right now. Don’t just string together nice-sounding words.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The arm I thought had stopped moved again. I was sick of it now. Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze looking down at me with hatred. Even the blood that had splattered on my face, everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you to stop!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted with the feeling that I didn’t care if my throat tore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gasp, the next moment I couldn’t breathe. My lungs and throat hurt so I couldn’t cough loudly and just barely took in and spat out small breaths.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even during this, I didn’t let go of Ja Hyeong-woo’s wrist, so my arm shook violently amid the fierce coughing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Will this also look like acting? It’s not though…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He probably wouldn’t believe me even if I said so. Since what little trust there was had fallen to rock bottom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The glass shard fell from Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand. The blood-stained shard fell to the floor and broke into smaller fragments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s other hand removed my fingers one by one from his arm. Soon after completely separating, Ja Hyeong-woo’s shoes disappeared from my downcast field of vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shuffled home. I made it to the front of my bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buzz. My phone vibrated gently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Startled, I pulled my phone from my pocket. I checked the message sender.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But soon my hand lost strength as before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Hae Mi-jun. At a glance, it seemed like a message saying good work on the raid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I might not know if I hadn’t seen it at all, but I’ve never delayed answering Hae Mi-jun’s messages after seeing them…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No strength went into it at all. I threw the phone away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I buried my face in the bed like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During the day I called Sa Ye-ho saying I’d come visit his house. The homeowner readily said to come over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The afternoon of the day after Stage 34. Sa Ye-ho was sitting in front of the TV gaming, his face particularly shiny from sleeping a lot. Since his short hair wasn’t tied up, instead of tying his hair he used a beaded hair tie to gather all his bangs into an apple head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho didn’t take his eyes off the character running through the ruined city on screen. Only his mouth moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why does your voice sound like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I strained my voice yesterday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho made a small tsk sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even with such an abbreviated answer, Sa Ye-ho understood the context.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I was fighting with Ja Hyeong-woo, I couldn’t see anything around me so I didn’t know… but it seems Sa Ye-ho, Woo Sae-geon, and Yang Pyo who had raided the stage together were watching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to play too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I unilaterally took Sa Ye-ho’s game pad. After saving the current game and going to the title screen, I connected another pad and started a new 2-player game.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked at me as if dumbfounded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can you even swallow games in the midst of all this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t people usually ask if you can swallow food?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You have to eat food.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The screen split in half for 2-player perspective. It was an FPS game where you cooperated with a partner to shoot zombies in a ruined city and complete missions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, even after holding the pad, I couldn’t immerse myself in the game.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [YOU DIED]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The same message kept appearing only on my side of the screen. I didn’t even think about how I died and just pressed respawn. I could hear Sa Ye-ho briefly muttering “What is this spaced-out troll bastard…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Did he come to the gym?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, this was the real purpose of coming to Sa Ye-ho’s house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I didn’t want to see Ja Hyeong-woo directly, I sent Sa Ye-ho as a spy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did he treat his injuries or not?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He didn’t.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment my character stood upright in the middle of zombies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Waaah―! Even the sound effect of the character being devoured and dying didn’t move me at all. I put down the pad.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho watched me like that with pity, not even laughing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since it’s covered by clothes, strangers wouldn’t know if they saw him. But he skipped chest workouts and barely did upper body. Since you and I are close, I think he deliberately showed it to me.”
 </span>
