  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 135
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When explaining recent music trends, his eyes sparkle, but Jin Seol-woon never brings up entertainment industry news or anything like that. He seems to dislike gossiping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’re planning to make one of the album tracks Christmas carol-style to match Christmas.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today’s Jin Seol-woon is spoiling Innate’s next album while placing fish meat on top of my rice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though they’re making a comeback without him, he doesn’t seem particularly shaken by it now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a welcome change, but I was actually getting a bit tired of listening. I figured Jin Seol-woon wouldn’t be hurt if I obviously changed the topic, so I casually cut him off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, let’s talk about training instead. Isn’t it hard after taking on Woo Sae-geon’s affiliated hunters? How was your condition during morning training today?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm… the serratus anterior above my waist has become more defined. Want to see? As leader, you should check on this kind of progress too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do I need to see that? Did you show Woo Sae-geon too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Jin Seol-woon, for some reason, briefly averted his eyes as if at a loss for words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…More than that, Gang-hyeon-ssi, you’re short on points right now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. This is all because they got a delinquent like me as their person in charge…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You could just collect from the successors.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s a good idea… not.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What kind of corrupt official-like talk is this guy casually spouting?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stared at him for quite a while in disbelief, but far from avoiding my gaze, Jin Seol-woon stared right back at me. In the end, Jin Seol-woon, who made me blink first, leaned his upper body back and shrugged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Try asking once. Everyone will want to give.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know what this guy knows to be so confident…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then you give first. Do you have some money?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I do. What I earned from training.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The leader position isn’t bad either. Getting respect from a top idol and all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Korean Hunter School, maintaining its daily routine as if something had changed yet not really, after the school’s head changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Here is a fifteen-year-old rookie hunter whose life has unwillingly shot up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey wow, that’s him.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The kid walking by right now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time Kwak Ji-hong went to and from the public areas for training attendance, he found it hard to handle the attention subtly focused on him. His face had gotten so red that now others probably thought the red face was his original skin color.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But hey, who would have known? That Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon would become leader, beating out Ja Hyeong-woo-nim?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he came to his senses, he had become the school’s only hunter directly under the leader…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He must have had foresight?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’d be good at stocks.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s not it, I… Kwak Ji-hong had no choice but to swallow his wronged and awkward feelings today too as he entered the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh, let’s watch him train once.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since he belongs to the leader, he must be good at something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Please just leave me alone… Kwak Ji-hong had to lock the door to the ‘earth’ affiliated hunter training room every single day without fail. So no one could peek in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I just… my mom and dad told me to live quietly without causing big trouble…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There will be other people joining soon besides me, right…? Kwak Ji-hong only felt burdened and lacked the cunning to feel satisfaction toward the people who had pushed him into Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s affiliation back then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, one more thing that was hard to just pass over was that personal messages from Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon flew in occasionally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  [Sorry I’m a bit busy]
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  [I’ll start looking after your training by next week at the latest]
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t want to, no, you don’t need to look after me… Kwak Ji-hong couldn’t bring himself to say this either and struggled helplessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was even too scared to look at the short spear weapon he’d given him, so he was carrying it around respectfully in his inventory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I can’t do it, the successor will give up quickly too. I just hope he won’t get angry…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Kwak Ji-hong at this time didn’t know. That Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s training was the kind that had pulled up the hopeless Hae Mi-jun and even raised Won Ha-ri who had no metal attribute senior.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, in the annex of the central building where the Twelve Zodiac meeting room was located.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With Woo Sae-geon’s retirement, all the hunters under him were at risk of losing their abilities entirely. Like transplanting plants to different pots, they had to immediately move to Yang Pyo or Jin Seol-woon, who had the same attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was that there were too many of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was an unfavorable situation, even Gyeon Gang-hyeon couldn’t just stand by and watch. Exactly ten people—no, even just five people—needed to share the burden of earth attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the past, even if he’d brought it up, he might have been ignored… but now he was the leader. He could find about five volunteers who were either adventurous or originally had weak abilities and weren’t particularly attached to great power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And on the day they were to officially receive power from Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Gyeon Gang-hyeon unexpectedly saw a face he already knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s been a while.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon looked up at him in confusion as he stood last among the five.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do, who had been Woo Sae-geon’s close associate. It was the first time since he had barged into Gang-hyeon’s room looking for records of school violence incidents.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had even volunteered to go directly under Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering his power as an A-rank hunter, it was almost wasteful. …Unless he was hiding some other ulterior motive beneath that bland expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do matched the height of Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was kneeling. Then he took off his shirt and bared his chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the location of the heart, or the place closest to the heart, skin touches skin to absorb energy. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s long, white fingers touched his chest first, then his palm smoothly attached.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in moments when most people would look at the ground or close their eyes because they felt embarrassed or the sensation was strange, Choi Jung-do only looked at his face with peculiar eyes. Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t notice as he was concentrating while breathing heavily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as it ended, Choi Jung-do lightly moved his body, which had slightly changed energy, then spoke first in a smooth tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “May I continue working in the discipline committee as before? If there are any issues related to that, I’ll come report directly to Gyeon Gang-hyeon-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other party, whose small face was filled with fatigue, gave casual approval then suddenly said something out of the blue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t still contact Woo Sae-geon, do you? Monitoring me to report back?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do answered calmly without changing his expression. It was a pointless misunderstanding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. I have no relation whatsoever to Woo Sae-geon… Yoon Sae-geon-nim. Yoon Sae-geon-nim said when he retires, everything ends. To be honest, I don’t think he’d even acknowledge me if we passed each other on the street.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after that, seeing Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s still dissatisfied expression, Choi Jung-do added more unprompted words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s only for a couple months anyway. After that, I’ll retire too when I come of age. My birthday is in December.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, right.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So before then…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do, who had trailed off, looked at Gyeon Gang-hyeon for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before then, what? Gyeon Gang-hyeon asked back, but Choi Jung-do said “Never mind” and moved past the topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was getting up, suddenly swayed greatly from dizziness. Choi Jung-do’s support immediately came in. His movements supporting the waist and holding the opposite hand were quite skilled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Be careful.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fine, let go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after obediently letting go, Choi Jung-do’s gaze swept over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s thin body for a while. His steps that were still slightly staggering despite pretending to be fine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m worried—may I escort you? Where are you going?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going home, home! Don’t follow me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course it was a lie. There was one more place he needed to stop by.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The isolation dormitory behind the former Ox Successor’s quarters, more often called ‘prison’ by students.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The very place where students previously classified as school violence perpetrators were staying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Supervising the students here was also part of Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s duties. Originally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. Absolutely not. Don’t even come near here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That is, it would have been if Ja Hyeong-woo hadn’t shown stubborn opposition and intercepted this task.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I look intimidating so it’s fine for me, but you might hear bad words from people who hold grudges for no reason. Go on. If you come even once more, I won’t let it slide.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What are you going to do if you don’t let it slide? No matter how much you’re handling it, I’m still the leader, so does it make sense to ignore me completely? At minimum, an inspection should come, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was afternoon training time now. So thinking it was a time when Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t be there, Gyeon Gang-hyeon had stealthily visited the isolation facility…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sure enough, he ran right into the navy blue hwarang outfit at the entrance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as he saw Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression hardened. His eyes immediately blazed fiercely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you not to come.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo walked toward him steadily. Watching the large build getting closer and closer, the words ‘I won’t let it slide’ seemed to come to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon tensed his body, thinking the guy might snatch him up like a sack of rice. When Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand came up, he was almost certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The raised hand cupped one of Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the hot palm’s heat covered his skin, that side of his eyes wrinkled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He should have slapped it away immediately, but Ja Hyeong-woo withdrew his hand faster, so he couldn’t do either. Something worse attacked the ear of the flustered Gyeon Gang-hyeon with dilated pupils.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your body is too cold. Go inside quickly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An almost whispered low voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crazy bastard. Barely managing to throw that one curse, Gyeon Gang-hyeon turned around sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Was that just now what you meant by not letting it slide? Because you do that…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In his head as he hurried his steps to get away from Ja Hyeong-woo, the shocking words he’d seen in the community played back intact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The things about Gyeon Gang-hyeon being the husband, Ja Hyeong-woo being the wife.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should never look at the community again. Even after completely turning off the internet on his phone, his anger didn’t subside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, he desperately wanted to grab Ja Hyeong-woo by the collar and confront him saying “It’s because of you!” Or at least say “Do you even know?” to remind him of how things looked from the outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he couldn’t do any of those things when actually facing him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even slow Gyeon Gang-hyeon had a feeling that he wouldn’t be able to properly handle the reaction the guy would show after such words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon deliberately stomped louder as he left the building. His head was completely blank.
 </span>
</p>
