  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 92
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People with different attributes from Gyeon Gang-hyeon, whose zodiac animals belong to yin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For fire, there was Sa Ye-ho; for wood, Myo Cho-hui; for water, Hae Mi-jun. Unfortunately, Won Ha-ri was ‘sheep,’ so there was no suitable candidate for metal attribute at this point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s consent had already been obtained, and Hae Mi-jun would unconditionally listen to whatever he said, so there was no need to worry about that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon finally stood before the biggest wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m scared to even talk to Myo Cho-hui…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, since Woo Sae-geon’s condition for allowing stage participation was obtaining consent from those three people, there was no other way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when he argued that consent wasn’t necessary since he wouldn’t do it with women anyway, Woo Sae-geon wouldn’t budge, so there was no other option.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had to contact Myo Cho-hui directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The very person he had desperately avoided encountering out of fear ever since he had blurted out about her parents in front of others last time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Myo Cho-hui’s disgust toward me will only increase the more we meet face-to-face… Phone call? No, chat… Should I just ask Won Ha-ri to pass along the message?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After agonizing over it, he chose to chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Rabbit Successor: Um, sorry for the sudden message
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Rabbit Successor: By any chance, wouldn’t you want to try creating a skill that mixes wood and earth attributes?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Rabbit Successor: You were originally interested in my skills anyway
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She had been interested. She was the first to notice Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s peculiarity and expressed her intention to experiment with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Though I brushed her off by siding with Woo Sae-geon’s line…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the most terrifying first contact in the world. Gyeon Gang-hyeon anxiously kept glancing at the chat window with uneasy eyes, until a reply came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But… an unexpectedly disturbing reply arrived.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Rabbit Successor &gt; Me: Tell me what I need to do. I’ll listen.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was unbelievable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A private chat and she responds this kindly? Myo Cho-hui? To me? To a scoundrel she can’t even stand to look at?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it a trap? Sarcasm? Mockery? Bewildered, Gyeon Gang-hyeon rubbed his eyes and looked at the chat window again. The content written in the chat window was still the same.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, let’s try explaining everything first. It wouldn’t be too late to confirm whether Myo Cho-hui was sincere then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Rabbit Successor: It’s not something we’d do now. I’m just letting you know in advance that we might need to do it later if a necessary situation arises
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me &gt; Rabbit Successor: Physical contact like holding wrists would be needed, is that okay?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Oh, my poor fate… Right now, it was practically like declaring to Myo Cho-hui that she’d need to make contact with a man. It would be fortunate if he didn’t die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon held his head. He had even reduced the contact area from ‘hand’ to ‘wrist’ in his efforts not to upset Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the result of that effort came with the second reply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Rabbit Successor &gt; Me: Got it. I’ll remember.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon trembled in shock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, Myo Cho-hui was also staring at the chat window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since she wasn’t in front of others, her face showed no deliberate liveliness—it was frighteningly expressionless. However, according to an expression that only her parents would recognize, she wasn’t currently in a bad mood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Both of them passed away.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That single sentence wouldn’t leave her mind, so she might be unusually dejected rather than anything else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…That was fucking scary.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That afternoon, Gyeon Gang-hyeon lay on the break room sofa with a pale face, telling Sa Ye-ho a tale that wasn’t really a heroic tale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. That’s weird for Myo Cho-hui noona. You should be careful walking alone at night.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who was sitting under the sofa with his arms draped over it, secretly rolled his eyes once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I thought it would be difficult for her to receive Gyeon Gang-hyeon favorably. Was that incident with her parents really the catalyst?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he suddenly gestured toward the break room doorway with his chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But why is that guy following you around? Are you his fan?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This break room where they were currently being lazy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was a weakling who couldn’t even keep up with half the average training time, and Sa Ye-ho was a slacker who didn’t even do half the average training time, so a cooperative relationship had formed. The two would occasionally run into each other in the break room and chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In such a place, the Twelve Zodiac’s top healer, Ja Hyeong-woo, was standing guard at the door dressed in his navy blue hwarang outfit, so he was bound to be in the way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon sharply turned his chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know. He says he’s monitoring me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo heard those words. He, who had been standing like a jangseung pole, instantly frowned and glared at the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The break room isn’t your personal space either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not my personal space, but you can’t come in. Because you need to be training. Get out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Sa Ye-ho suddenly said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is he monitoring your chastity?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What the hell… It’s not even worth responding to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t entirely wrong though. If you considered it monitoring the contact chastity that the other party would lose through contact with Gyeon Gang-hyeon…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s cheeks turned slightly red. He struck Sa Ye-ho’s shoulder from behind with his fist. Trying to hide his embarrassment, his mouth ran even more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, wasn’t your broadcast the kind without sexual jokes? But what the hell is in this bastard’s head?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If this counts as sexual jokes, our Gang-jji is really pure.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been giggling, suddenly made his slit eyes sparkle. As if something had just occurred to him, he tapped Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, when we do that thing in the stage, can we put in several at once? Let’s try putting me and Sae-geon hyung in together.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Only one attribute at a time works, you crazy bastard. Why is Woo Sae-geon even coming up when he’s not directly involved? Are you trying to fuck with me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s ‘fuck’ to oppa?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon got really angry, he used harsh profanity too. Sa Ye-ho was grinning and trying to appease Gyeon Gang-hyeon when a chat notification popped up on Sa Ye-ho’s status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo kept his gaze fixed on the wall, waiting for Sa Ye-ho to send back a properly thought-out response.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression crumpled violently. The other party wasn’t listening to the warning even with one ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>

  Me &gt; Snake Successor: Can’t you understand? I told you not to say dirty things to Gang-hyeon. Before I cut off your heals.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While chatting and only smirking with the corners of his mouth, Sa Ye-ho glanced back at Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he knew it, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was lying sideways on the sofa, dozing off. His eyes were already more than half closed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Going to sleep? Here?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No… I’ll go home and sleep.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s voice carried a moment of bewilderment as he asked back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, if you leave now—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he could even say “I’ll be left alone with Ja Hyeong-woo,” Gyeon Gang-hyeon had already disappeared with a poof.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An eerie silence flowed through the break room like a lie. Sa Ye-ho glanced at the massive figure by the door like someone whose shield had disappeared, leaving only his bare body behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, actually this worked out well. Without Gang-hyeon here. Sa Ye-ho soon leaned back on the sofa with his hands clasped and faced Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The conditions Gang-hyeon is looking for to do the yin-yang experiment are these, right? Successors who have different attributes, are male, and are adults. When you filter by all the conditions… there’s one person left, isn’t there?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two men, who had never had any particular interest or curiosity about each other, made eye contact for almost the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These people who would never have had such a conversation before Gyeon Gang-hyeon appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re pissed that you don’t meet the conditions and I do, aren’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t monitoring Gyeon Gang-hyeon—he was monitoring Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having figured this out just from being in the same space, Sa Ye-ho was dying of amusement at this situation. Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze became even sharper.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon receives yin energy, his already insufficient yang energy gets drawn toward it, disrupting his body’s balance. However, if you only consider skill power, that’s better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon receives yang energy, conversely, it has no meaning for skill fusion. However, the energy he personally needs gets recharged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t control himself. Until Gyeon Gang-hyeon completely finished that ‘experiment,’ he would probably be like this the entire time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He sought out wherever he was and followed him around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even using his mouse familiar to keep track of where Gang-hyeon went and getting detailed reports of what conversations he had wasn’t enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When it comes to contact and such, if something happens, the mouse familiar can’t physically intervene.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While doing nothing but shameful acts, another, more upright self in Ja Hyeong-woo’s head kept pressing him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When are you going to confess to him what that healing method that keeps saving Gang-hyeon actually is?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was getting closer and closer to the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he had come up with the idea of receiving attribute energy containing yin energy from others to use skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There would definitely come a time when he would accurately diagnose the cause of his pain as ‘lack of yang energy’ and furthermore realize on his own that he had been recovering by obtaining yang energy from external sources all this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I should tell him the truth first before that happens…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He kept postponing it out of fear of the reaction. Vaguely hoping that a time would come when their relationship became more favorable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Afraid that Gang-hyeon would get angry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or afraid that he might go to someone else more comfortable and ask them to do it instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he used the excuse of a healer’s duty, Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t actually the only person capable of giving yang energy. There was someone else who met the conditions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Jin Seol-woon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought of the Dragon Successor. Though two years younger, he was definitely an adult, and had a sculpture-like mature appearance with almost no baby fat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Actually, if Gang-hyeon learns the truth…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Afraid that he himself would become unable to do it. Afraid of being taken away from.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was aware that he was doing wrong by Gang-hyeon. It was deceiving him. He knew it all. However, time and again, he rationalized it to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Guilt accumulated in his chest.
