  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 168
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri lifted her beloved sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the large monkey also raised its mystical blade made of silver-white currents.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pssss-swoosh. The monsters approached, bumping their straw limbs together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Compared to the previous tigers and jangsan beom, they weren’t very threatening. Without much effort, swords cut through them, arrows pierced them, they burned easily in fire and quickly got soaked in water, making their movements sluggish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But keeping in mind that carelessness is forbidden, we entered into full-scale strategy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri, go wild on your own to your heart’s content. The rest of you support the sword dancer while coordinating according to orders.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In front of the wood attribute monsters, I unleashed a successor who was a sharp blade by her very existence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Only use skills when I tell you to, and manage your stamina. It looks like it’ll be a prolonged battle due to the monsters’ mass offensive.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun answered energetically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind him, I could see Myo Cho-hui and Ma Cheon-ah on one side, and Ja Hyeong-woo and Jin Seol-woon on the other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The setting for facing monsters this time was a forest full of magnificent trees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wildflowers were in full bloom everywhere, and a rainbow even appeared over the picturesque waterfall. It was distracting in a different way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This time the monsters are Jewung. And Maegu……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Monsters with names meaning straw dolls swarmed in droves and surrounded us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jewung meant straw dolls made by humans. Depending on the maker’s intention, they could become cursed dolls, guardian dolls, or even protective dolls against misfortune.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Well, right now they’re just dolls that kill people.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monkey unleashed a terrifying momentum and swung its spirit sword. Each time it swept forward, straw monsters fell away in droves. Like an adult in front of children, the gap was very clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The fire demons last time were too harsh.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today the air is cool too, and the straw cuts cleanly. While carefully gauging the monsters’ characteristic dark energy without missing it, I shouted loudly toward the monkey familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go Sungsong-ah! It’s your world!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is Sungsong now…… Won Ha-ri quietly grimaced. I deliberately giggled even louder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Well, even if I die in 10 minutes, I’ll try to boost team morale first. Today Sa Ye-ho didn’t come with us either, so I have to work hard alone.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Torn straw flew in all directions. Jin Seol-woon and Myo Cho-hui stood like wings on both sides, securing territory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I managed Won Ha-ri dominating in front and Ma Cheon-ah spreading her wings in back while closely observing the surroundings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hundreds and thousands of Jewung were visible, but not a single strand of fox fur could be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As often depicted in folklore, Maegu or the nine-tailed fox was said to have lived for a thousand years. If so, the monster that took that name would likely have equally high intelligence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know for sure, but it might have intelligence like the fire demon stage boss from last time. This time conversation might be possible too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Jewung are mobs and the boss is likely Maegu. I don’t see its energy yet
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri was happily cutting through enemies in the front. She looked particularly good and energetic today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Sword Incarnation (Metal Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She even drew out one of her metal attribute skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m glad Won Ha-ri at least is fine.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, I hadn’t even shot my bow thirty times yet but my arms were already getting tingly. I sighed inwardly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I miss my physical condition from before I got sick. Actually, even then I was the weakest of the weak, but to think it could get even worse from there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I have to conserve even a few arrows. Knowing my condition, Ja Hyeong-woo seriously suggested leaving me out of the 22nd stage. I snapped at him saying not to talk nonsense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone seemed to have developed trauma instead of me. They kept glancing at me and managing things so that not even a piece of straw would graze me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was attacking somewhat aggressively for a while, but then went back to being a defensive tanker, wrapping us in a circle with his dragon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah wasn’t showing off but was faithfully blocking in front of me, so that says it all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While clearing up the straw dolls rushing in like clouds, something strange caught my eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One Jewung that was somehow wearing something like white cloth, had an unusually small head and long legs proportion, and seemed to be swaying somewhat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……The moment Won Ha-ri’s sword was about to touch it, I shouted loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shot an arrow and barely deflected the sword. That Jewung tumbled among the other monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I aged ten years. Feeling cold sweat running down my spine, I let out a sigh of relief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That was almost fucked.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Jewung here were cursed dolls.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That thing just now looked exactly like me with its stupid appearance.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Understanding my words one by one, everyone’s faces turned pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They seemed to imagine the consequences if Won Ha-ri’s sword had struck that Jewung directly. Won Ha-ri almost dropped her sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, can a swordsman drop their sword?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly mocked her jokingly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, the monsters here weren’t completely easy either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If there were monsters among them that had to be kept alive, Won Ha-ri would become noticeably timid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Won Ha-ri gets too nervous about potentially hurting others. Though she actually does hurt people.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There are Jewung mixed in that were made copying us. They seem to be cursed dolls. If the monster gets hurt, that person will get hurt the same way. Avoid them and attack!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The cursed dolls quickly emerged as a considerable nuisance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Protecting specific Jewung while selectively defeating only the others wasn’t an easy task. No matter how much group training we do to avoid team-killing colleagues normally, it’s different when they’re enemies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, would those Jewung modeled after us just stay still?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now, we had been killing Jewung before they could attack us. Now that Jewung appeared that we couldn’t do that to, the combat advantages that Jewung possessed finally became visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, though they were made of straw, when they swung their arms widely, it delivered blows like iron clubs. And their ends were quite sharp, so when stabbing, they were like fencing swords.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ack! Dragon oppa stabbed me!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the special Jewung, one with white cloth feathers tried to poke Ma Cheon-ah with its arm. Ma Cheon-ah was making a fuss even though it didn’t even touch her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had been maintaining distance from other successors, just slightly furrowed his brow and passed it by instead of counterattacking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s going to be an accident at this rate.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There are limits to fighting while ignoring and avoiding them. The kids’ movement patterns keep getting tangled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to do something about those Jewung.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s nothing useful among Ja Hyeong-woo’s curse skills. Should I use the dragon familiar to send them far away somewhere? But what if Jin Seol-woon or the Jewung get hurt in the process?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, my eyes met with Hae Mi-jun who was beside me. As if reading my thoughts, our gazes exchanged, and Hae Mi-jun spoke first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung, perhaps I could……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly the not-so-distant past flashed through my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was right after I got up from the sickbed and Gang-hyeon’s past became known to the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t just me whose abilities improved, and it wasn’t just Won Ha-ri who succeeded in familiar control.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun also achieved unexpected results.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it wasn’t miraculous healing skills like Ja Hyeong-woo’s, or support skills like anesthesia skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Clear Blue Winter (Water Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an attack skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I first saw that skill, I—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did you do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I scolded Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Attack skills aren’t essential. You’re a healer. You should treasure your body the most. You don’t need to do things like this!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was perplexed and unconsciously pressed him, then belatedly looked at Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun held his head up straight and acted quite confidently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wanted to become someone trustworthy to Gang-hyeon hyung. Like Hyeong-woo hyung. I’m sorry for surprising you……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to be looking ahead to becoming the sole healer for a while after Ja Hyeong-woo retires next year.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Ja Hyeong-woo uses debuff skills or curse skills for attacks, Hae Mi-jun can make more full-scale attacks than that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a way, it’s the power closest to the essence of water attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Catch the strange Jewung one by one and freeze them. Don’t freeze them too solid. Make it feel like you’re imprisoning them by leaving the inside of the ice empty. Can you do it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, I’ll try!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Hae Mi-jun joined the attack side, the cursed Jewung were quickly subdued. The formation stabilized again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The number of monsters decreased rapidly, and the last Jewung completely fell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was right then that the boss monster spread an invisible presence and influenced the stage somehow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly all the successors disappeared from in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned on communication first and quickly observed my surroundings. I held my bow and took a defensive stance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fortunate thing was that group communication wasn’t cut off. Everyone quickly responded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What is this!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I don’t know where this is!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The young ones were surprised and flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon, are you okay?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The boss monster seems to have scattered us apart. We need a way to regroup.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, Ja Hyeong-woo quickly asked about my safety first. Myo Cho-hui grasped the situation faster than I did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after confirming that all six people except me were fine could I see my situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right now I’m alone. Maybe one-on-one with the boss monster.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tension immediately rose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
