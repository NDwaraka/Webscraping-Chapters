<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I receive yin energy directly, my body actually sustains considerable internal injuries.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Would I die if Squeaky didn’t take care of me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stronger I use my skills, the more my body gets torn apart. I was a body that couldn’t even be used as a vessel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe Ja Hyeong-woo’s nagging about not receiving other people’s energy was right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering the impact that a scoundrel successor’s death would have on Korea, it might be better to just bury this whole new skill development thing forever.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But still… I can’t. If I have a skill, I need to master it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, there was something weighing on my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The final battle scenes that would be in the original story, the gloomy future where I would inevitably be mobilized there too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why I waver. Both my attitude and my mindset.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hate running away like the past Gyeon Gang-hyeon did, but I don’t have the courage to throw my whole body into it either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time I shower, I check my body’s condition and test my grip strength. At a point where others would have already gained weight and built muscle, I confirm each time that I’m barely maintaining my condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems like maintaining life takes more energy than for other healthy people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘According to Manager Park Yoon-seok’s description, the original Gang-hyeon suffered pain as if his whole body was being torn to pieces.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least I’ve awakened, so I’m somewhat better off. The original Gang-hyeon had to endure the backlash of failed awakening with a body in even worse condition than now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he drank so much harmful alcohol despite knowing how his body would end up, trying to forget both physical and mental pain—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Essentially, Gang-hyeon had given up on himself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shook my head to forget the speculation that had unconsciously surfaced.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If my speculation about Gang-hyeon’s ‘sudden death’ is true… Ja Hyeong-woo would be too miserable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Ja Hyeong-woo holds everything. Both my lifeline and the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The reason I can make up my mind to keep moving with this body… seems to be because I believe Ja Hyeong-woo won’t abandon me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The preliminary information for this Stage was released. For the first time, the personnel limit wasn’t 5 but 6. Moreover, the Stage difficulty was A.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Stage difficulty has been rising from D to C, C to B, so that was expected, this was the first time the 5-person formation adapted to four directions had changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘One successor equals an S-rank hunter, so adding one more combatant means the danger level is that much higher.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I was included in that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Far from adding a high-attack combatant, they gained one burden.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If the fusion skill is judged to be not worth investing in this time either… retirement pension or whatever, I have to consider myself hopeless.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I really got a dedicated healer attached to me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon kept his promise. Of course, in that process, he didn’t consider at all how the people would look down on me and mock me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the original formation was a fixed 5-person system, Hae Mi-jun, who became today’s sixth raider, ended up like my sidekick. Even so, Hae Mi-jun was in such a good mood that he just kept giggling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You know, it feels like my dream came true… I’m happy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What dream?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wanted to fight beside Gang-hyeon hyung…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please dream bigger.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun, his face flushed red, kept glancing behind us nervously for some reason. His voice was also small. I don’t think he was like this before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I turned around—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally enough, behind me was Ja Hyeong-woo, who was in charge of the rear position. Our eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned my head away first. While crossing the Stage entrance, I was careful not to stumble, while turning over thoughts in my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is Hae Mi-jun being conscious of Ja Hyeong-woo? …Is it because he ended up coming in as a healer together with his mentor?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When adding one person, leader Woo Sae-geon had to choose between ‘adding a dealer’ and ‘adding a healer.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Obviously we should add a dealer. There are monster grades. Even adding one person, Ja Hyeong-woo could easily handle the healing. Why would we need to add a healer?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Including me, the majority opinion was to add a dealer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Woo Sae-geon added a healer. Because of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not only that. After looking at the monster types in the Stage preliminary information, he removed both support tankers Yang Pyo and Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That said, to call it an attack power focus… it was already ruined from the point he included me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Or could it be…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did Woo Sae-geon place some kind of possibility on my fusion skill?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That can’t be. Woo Sae-geon is such a thorough person who doesn’t rely on luck. Moreover, he’s someone who has zero expectations for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside the entrance, healthy-colored soil spread widely to the horizon like a neatly plowed field. It was befitting a stronghold of earth attribute monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I stood with both feet on the soil, I covered my mouth. Instantly, all eyes focused on me from all directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you having another episode?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. Something’s… the ground is shaking too much. I’m getting nauseous.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun hurried over and grabbed my arm. Unlike the others who were somewhat bewildered, Woo Sae-geon had a face that seemed to sense something from the beginning, glaring at the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he suddenly thrust one of his two swords vertically deep into the ground. Deeply, until more than half the blade went in and the handle touched the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the entire ground began to vibrate. I swayed and settled on Hae Mi-jun’s shoulder, catching my breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader, are you trying to watch him throw up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can throw up on me, hyung! Or should I heal, heal you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You be quiet!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t hear Woo Sae-geon’s answer. Either it wasn’t worth responding to, or…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had taken a combat stance and focused on something more urgent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The docile ground began writhing wildly as if full of bugs. I could feel the squirming right under my feet. I really felt like I was going to throw up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s shout awakened us from our stupor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Call your familiars and get on! Ja Hyeong-woo, have Gang-hyeon ride Hae Mi-jun’s familiar!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Hae Mi-jun hugged me and called out his pig familiar, the soil exploded and flew everywhere at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Poisonous insects with snake heads, Quadruple-headed Worm monsters, poured out from under the soil.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hiss—! An unpleasant sound that was bad enough with just one became hundreds and thousands overlapping. They had snake heads but many legs like centipedes. Each one was about the size of a human head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Small for monsters, but really disgustingly, creepily large for bugs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Kyaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This dolphin-like sound wasn’t Myo Cho-hui’s scream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was on an ox familiar, clinging to Woo Sae-geon like a koala. His face was rarely pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, having secured a safe distance on Hae Mi-jun’s large wild boar and not having screamed, I had enough composure to make at least one joke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, those are your kin. What’s wrong?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fuck off!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, Woo Sae-geon maintained perfect composure without wavering at all despite carrying an adult man’s weight. He stood upright with an extremely cold face, then shook his shoulders once. Sa Ye-ho fell off with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the single-minded determination to cling to human bodies, the bugs were sticking out their thin tongues and climbing over each other to form mountains, and Sa Ye-ho was falling toward them—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he could crash, a red semi-transparent form crossed over the bugs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s hand pressed against his snake familiar and he spun around nimbly. Standing on the familiar, he screamed at the top of his lungs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Burn them all, damn it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Flames blazed up along the path the snake had trampled. Hisss…! The bugs made pained sounds as they burned up in flames.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The snake familiar I was seeing for the first time was smaller than Jin Seol-woon’s dragon, but large enough to easily swallow a person. From its pointed head, it was definitely a venomous snake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to the snake’s nature of moving by crawling close to the ground, Sa Ye-ho rode his familiar standing up like a surfboard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They can’t climb up onto familiars!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, holding me and looking down, shouted loudly with relief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since familiars were close to spirits, they had no substance unless a tanker’s familiar was charging with the intention of ramming. So bugs couldn’t cling to familiars.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As long as we didn’t make direct physical contact, there was no problem with bugs that were said to parasitize humans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s why Woo Sae-geon excluded the tankers.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bugs are small and come up from underground. Tanker charges aren’t very useful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, he deployed Myo Cho-hui with wood attributes, who was said to dig into soil and weaken it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, sitting on a green rabbit, looked thoroughly disgusted. She seemed to have lost all love for life due to her revulsion toward bugs. Her eyes had lost their light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>

  Snake Successor: Myo Cho-hui noona! Your eyes are unfocused right now!

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho informed her while riding his snake in a wide circle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui quickly came to her senses and switched back to her bright, public-facing eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the talk about parents came up, the other successors had become more comfortable with Myo Cho-hui. I guess they felt her humanity thinking ‘that person has something precious too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From that point on, I think Myo Cho-hui also softened a little. Even if there doesn’t seem to be much difference on the surface.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Myo Cho-hui, focus on combat. Sa Ye-ho, you handle boss detection.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yess~”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Woo Sae-geon finished speaking, Sa Ye-ho immediately separated from the midst of the ongoing battle. Red hair fluttered on the snake that was making large circles around the area.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the &lt;Snake’s Eye&gt; skill activated, I briefly made eye contact with Sa Ye-ho in the distance. The pupils in his bright yellow irises were vertically slit like a reptile’s.
 </span>
</p>

  Sa Ye-ho quickly covered his eyes with his hands.
