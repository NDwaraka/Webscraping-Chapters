  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 188

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unable to endure any longer, he carefully reached out his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I recoiled and pushed away that hand as if I’d seen a monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t touch me!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My vision became uncontrollably cloudy. A salty taste came from lips that could only speak hurtful words. My entire face became drenched with moisture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then clenching the sobs that had been flowing from my mouth, I turned my head away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What kind of nonsense bullshit is this? That bastard Ja Hyeong-woo made it up on his own. It’s not me who can’t accept reality, it’s Ja Hyeong-woo!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, the sphere monster I had forgotten came into view.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sphere’s surface had been deeply cracked since who knows when. The moment I gave it my attention, the sphere split in half with a crack!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The instant I inadvertently saw the broken interior.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My consciousness flew away as if being turned off. Ja Hyeong-woo’s voice calling me grew distant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Red cloth tied to strings fluttered here and there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a courtyard scene Han Hyeong-woo had been seeing since before entering elementary school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had turned 21 that year, woke up early in the morning to organize his bedding. He neatly tied his long hair into one bundle and changed into modest hemp clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after graduating high school, he didn’t seek any particular job, living by organizing the shrine and assisting his guardian.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, he lived a more stagnant and austere life than others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for the person he constantly longed for, he couldn’t properly form friendships or romantic feelings. He wasn’t even interested in entertainment like computers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No one who had passed by him at school knew where he lived or what work he did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t told even Cheon Gang-hyeon, who had left long ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His mother had essentially sold him as labor to a shaman’s house, hoping her son’s remaining life wouldn’t be impoverished due to money.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘People already find me gloomy and scary, so if they knew this too, Hyeon would probably avoid me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo didn’t originally have shamanic abilities. However, working at the shaman’s house from a young age and being exposed to related things had opened his spiritual sight a little. He could occasionally sense something fleetingly from guests who came to the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t have any other skills, so I have no complaints about living like this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His life, which seemed like it would only be marked by static colors, faced a great change in the winter of his 21st year.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He entered Hunter School. And.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeon-ah……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He met his only person again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The year Cheon Gang-hyeon turned fifteen, he stood as chief mourner at his mother’s and father’s funerals two months apart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first funeral happened less than two months after his mother started receiving treatment at the hospital. So in just four months, he had lost all his family.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the same disease his mother had suffered from came to him too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The spirited fifteen-year-old soul was trapped in a sick body, tied to a hospital bed with IV needles and insertion tubes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon lay on the hospital bed thinking of his old friends. Countless faces came to mind, but after falling ill, fewer than five people were those he had contacted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Han Hyeong-woo wasn’t among them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll absolutely never tell him. I don’t want pity. Even when I was healthy, he worried about me being weak, so I don’t want to be worried about more.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he thought of Han Hyeong-woo with his slightly grown mind, it was frustrating. Additionally cringeworthy. Even though they were both boys, Han Hyeong-woo often acted particularly unusual toward him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was why he hadn’t contacted him even after transferring schools.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You live without me for a while too. You have a good body and you’re tall, and though you’re taciturn, you’re fine when you talk… you’ll do well when you enter middle school.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he ended up being rushed to the hospital, so he never contacted him in the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Spending day after day in the hospital, Cheon Gang-hyeon hoped Han Hyeong-woo was hating him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t kept his promise to contact him later, so it wouldn’t be very difficult. And he now hated Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If we hate each other, neither of us will be sad when I die.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One day, while living the same powerless life as when he was young even after becoming an adult, Cheon Gang-hyeon opened his eyes in a strange ruin. It was Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This isn’t even a novel.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All he could do from his sickbed was read or watch things. Thinking it was similar to novels he’d read then made everything seem trivial.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that wasn’t what was important.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His skin texture reflected in the broken glass was clear and transparent. Remarkably fresh vitality was flowing through it. The sickly pallor had disappeared completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Could it be…… I’m all better? Because I’m a reserve awakener?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Manager Park Yoon-seok was shocked upon hearing Cheon Gang-hyeon’s background and immediately had him meet with a doctor remotely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And it was proven that all of Cheon Gang-hyeon’s illnesses had disappeared with his awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day he received a complete recovery diagnosis in an extraordinary way, Cheon Gang-hyeon stamped his feet and ran around all day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had tried to stay relatively calm in his own way. Because he knew from the news that Gate Breaks had taken countless lives.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll work hard as a hunter, feeling sorry for the victims.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the feeling that the second part of his life was beginning, he coincidentally encountered an old friend in the same place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone he perhaps never wanted to see, but now that he was better, might be quite welcome to meet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s really Hyeon……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he learned that what he had hoped for over the past few years had been in vain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo hadn’t forgotten Cheon Gang-hyeon at all. Rather, he had become more desperate. The way he looked at him with what seemed like overwhelming joy was burdensome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had grown absurdly large and burly, looked down at him and said worriedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, why did you get even thinner? You weren’t sick somewhere, were you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon’s heart sank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is that what you say upon seeing me? In the end, you’re pitying me again, aren’t you? You’re the healthy one, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he thought sullenly, he was actually afraid. Afraid that Han Hyeong-woo would notice he had been sick.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That strange disposition of cherishing Cheon Gang-hyeon terribly hadn’t changed, so if he knew the truth, he would obviously be tremendously shocked and probably want to dig a hole and crawl into it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Gang-hyeon deliberately acted more cheerful. Because Han Hyeong-woo absolutely couldn’t find out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo followed the first awakener Woo Sae-geon and awakened immediately. He was said to be a very promising healer with potential. A healer who cures sick people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And for Cheon Gang-hyeon, rather than proper awakening, he developed mysterious pain and lethargy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. What’s wrong with you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had just started training, completely abandoned a whole day’s training just because Cheon Gang-hyeon’s complexion looked a little bad. Woo Sae-geon, who had just started controlling students, had to be furious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you mean hurts? Go do your training!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon accumulated stress from chasing away Han Hyeong-woo, who came every day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To shake off Han Hyeong-woo, his words became increasingly harsh and his nerves became sensitive. Each day became burdensome. His pain, called awakening sickness, didn’t improve, making it even worse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Stop following me around……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He now really hated Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He always thought: If he had such a strong body, if he had the ability to heal others, he would have used it better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having spent half his life in pain, he discovered he had become more ugly than when he was young. He had come to envy Han Hyeong-woo’s physical body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why can’t I awaken? Is it because I originally had a sick body?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only he could awaken, his body would heal and he wouldn’t have to hurt Han Hyeong-woo with his irritable attitude. Cheon Gang-hyeon became obsessed with awakening. To the point of recklessly entering any gate hoping for awakening in crisis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And really, he reached the threshold of awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /You will become a unique special successor.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the status window demanded something too great.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The one and only successor who can encompass all attributes? But that ability comes with pain?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon couldn’t accept this. Why was he chosen? He resented this world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How long do I have to be in pain? Can’t I stop hurting now? I hate it, I can’t do it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His life that wouldn’t go his way was miserable, so in that moment Cheon Gang-hyeon gave up on awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. Are you okay……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had naturally followed when he entered the gate, worriedly placed a hand on his shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In an unstable mental state, the moment he saw someone who greatly stimulated his emotions, Cheon Gang-hyeon lost his reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop caring about me!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like someone not in his right mind, he swung his arm wildly. Thunk, the arm he threw out carelessly happened to……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been holding a knife for self-defense. When he noticed, the blade had already shallowly stabbed into Han Hyeong-woo’s chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an accident. Cheon Gang-hyeon was startled and tried to examine Han Hyeong-woo’s wound, but seeing eyes that seemed more hurt in heart than body, he stepped backward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, he turned his back and ran away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only Cheon Gang-hyeon and Han Hyeong-woo knew about that incident. There were no other witnesses. Han Hyeong-woo covered up this matter. It became known to the world that Cheon Gang-hyeon had been scared of monsters and fled from the gate.
