  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 185
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We were just as reckless as the bamboo leaf soldiers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet the fact that no one had died was all thanks to the healers’ hard work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Hae Mi-jun and Hyeong-woo’s healing skills were a vast lake, now the two were healing while squeezing out even the dried bottom of that lake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There are still two giants left…!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We were completely on the defensive. I pondered whether there was another breakthrough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bamboo leaf soldiers’ attribute was metal. Metal should properly be subdued by fire—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I had already used the fire cardinal deity before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the only option was to call upon the same attribute with at least equal power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeong-woo, hold onto this!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I jumped down from the dog.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon! Hyeong-woo reached out and shouted, but I pretended not to hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I did roll once from the failed landing, but got up without major injury.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon oppa!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s face turned white when she saw me. Even so, she didn’t run to me and just kept swinging her sword in place, which made me feel pleased despite the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s call your cardinal deity! Watch for timing and give me your hand!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? What are you talking about! We don’t match each other!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri shouted in confusion, not understanding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She was right. I’m also ‘yang’, and Won Ha-ri is also ‘yang’. The conditions don’t match.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unless a new metal attribute successor appeared, the last remaining cardinal deity couldn’t be summoned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to the existing rules, that is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m yang, but I’m also yin.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching Won Ha-ri’s complexion turn strange, I recited playfully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I died and came back to life. I’m actually no-attribute.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you mean died! You’re perfectly alive! Are you going to say such childish things!?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri got angry, taking it as a joke. I felt both relieved and bitter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To maintain an awakened person’s body, whether it’s the Twelve Zodiac ‘Dog’ or yang energy, I’m wearing the same things as others.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the original yang energy that should be there is already at rock bottom anyway, then fine, let me try creating some yin energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I broke the system’s rules once, I should definitely be able to do other things too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grabbed Won Ha-ri and pulled her into an embrace. The body trapped in my arms struggled. However, perhaps because she was worried I might fall and get hurt, she couldn’t seriously push me away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the future of the successors, so your energy can’t be damaged.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From Won Ha-ri in my arms, I absorbed all the cool, tingling energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because it was yang energy, it was good energy that wouldn’t harm me. However, with a heart similar to taking my own life, I… rejected all the energy that had entered me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Forcibly twisting something that didn’t fit the rules to make it fit. Intense pain struck as if everything that made up my body was being twisted. I tasted blood in my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, I succeeded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

  To avoid losing consciousness, I embraced Hyeong-woo. I hastily drank the yang energy he gave me.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, South Korea was in an uproar over extraordinary news.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It has been 6 hours since the successors announced their stage entry.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When everyone watching the news had no way of knowing what was happening inside and could only stare at the news with anxious hearts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A change occurred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s world rank has risen. The World Hunter Association has also sent an official document… At this very moment I’m speaking, it has risen again!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There had been no previous cases of someone rising several rank levels in such a short period.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“He has surpassed Successor Ja Hyeong-woo. Korea’s #1 has changed.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What… what is happening?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the announcer’s voice trembled with excitement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The survival of the entire world hung on the narrow time surrounding one person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But neither ordinary people nor fellow awakened knew this fact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the Azure Dragon had destroyed all the soul stones, the body of the giant rolling on the ground was persistent. Parts of the giant kept moving and its arms clattered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s still some energy left from the soul stones!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But since the Azure Dragon had brought all the soul stones to the surface earlier, I just need to find the ones with remaining energy in that pile of dirt and destroy them!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking that, I turned my head toward that pile of dirt—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gasped. I immediately pushed away Hyeong-woo, who had been pressing his lips to mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeong-woo, I’m fine now so go heal Hae Mi-jun and Won Ha-ri!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is that bastard doing!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was digging through the pile of dirt with his sword, finding soul stone fragments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he tried to touch them directly, the soul stones repelled him. Even as his bones broke and he became covered in bruises, Jin Seol-woon gritted his teeth and destroyed the soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can destroy them! Why are you doing it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon familiar, its body half-collapsed, blocked me from approaching. I stamped my feet behind it and shouted frantically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi, don’t approach.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why! I’m fine even if I touch them!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeong-woo-ssi, ugh, told me. That Gang-hyeon-ssi, gasp, might be in a half-dead state.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon could barely continue speaking, constantly breathing heavily. His completely broken arm stubbornly struck down on the soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crack, crunch. Every time he moved his hand, something breaking could be heard. That sound distorted even my heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I heard that, as meaning standing, on the boundary. Like the name of, Gang-hyeon-ssi’s first skill. So Gang-hyeon-ssi… No, if you die…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The last soul stone fragment scattered with a sharp sound. Jin Seol-woon collapsed softly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did the dragon let me move forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon that had prioritized its master’s body above all now prioritized its master’s commands even when the master became a wreck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had his eyes closed as if unconscious, but the chat window moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in that moment, he was worrying about me who would remain at the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Exactly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m just an extra. I muttered to myself without realizing it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sent back Jin Seol-woon and Won Ha-ri too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was still freezing the giant until then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to excessive skill use, his power went out of control, and he was freezing himself along with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s body was cold as ice. His consciousness was fading, and he couldn’t even hold his head up. Hyeong-woo and I hurriedly helped Hae Mi-jun up and sent him back to school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After using several intermediate skills, the last giant soldier also fell with a thud to the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp, huff…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a while, only my heavy breathing echoed through the area. The surroundings had become quiet before I knew it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, not a single living enemy remained in the clearing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was alone with Hyeong-woo. Two out of nine people remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo was about to say something. I quickly raised my index finger to my lips and silenced Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The conquest success message hasn’t appeared.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With my battered body leaning against Hyeong-woo, I waited. For some change to occur in the empty clearing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For another ordeal to drive me to the brink.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For an instant, the ground let out a thin cry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A spine-chilling wailing sound, like the cries of ghosts, spread thinly through the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surrounding me and Hyeong-woo, ghosts sprouted up abundantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if this clearing had been their graveyard from the beginning, and we had summoned them so they all woke from sleep at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They all wore pure white burial clothes and had pale faces. Children, women, men, and elderly people were mixed in various ways.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They swarmed toward us. As soon as they moved their legs floating in mid-air, the distance closed instantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They have killing intent!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hastily mounted the dog familiar. Hyeong-woo, who had mounted much faster than me, grabbed me and lifted me up in a flash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The more the ghosts ran through the clearing, the more their numbers increased. It was terrifying how they chased with both arms spread wide.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If we stopped even for a brief moment, we would immediately be torn apart by the ghosts without even a piece of flesh remaining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bottle containing the rice wine, the gourd, couldn’t capture that many ghosts. Hyeong-woo grabbed my shoulder and shouted frantically in my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Bring back the people who went out! It’s better than having no one!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The teammates I had sent away. They would all have recovered their energy to some extent with healing that gathered the power of regular hunters, and would just be waiting for me to summon them again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slowly shook my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, it’s better to have no one. Because I can’t concentrate when I’m anxious.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My utterly peaceful eyes met Hyeong-woo’s eyes. Hyeong-woo looked like he’d been hit. He muttered helplessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You… by any chance… you never intended to call them back from the beginning…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon his pitch-black pupils sharpened menacingly. He gripped my shoulder hard enough to make it ache slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Summon the others.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I said summon them!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you defying the leader you chose?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I asked back aggressively without avoiding his eyes. While forcefully pushing Hyeong-woo’s chest with my elbow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo’s irises shook deeply from within. His fierce momentum died down softly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now he pleaded with me desperately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry. Please don’t send me away too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart ached, but I didn’t show it outwardly. I forced my will on Hyeong-woo and turned my head away.
 </span>
</p>
