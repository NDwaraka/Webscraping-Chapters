<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s reply that he finally received after several hours.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo glared intensely at that single character as if he were facing the most difficult exam he had never solved in his entire life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m not very quick on the uptake, so I don’t really understand when you just say it like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does this mean I can come to his house? If so, right now? But what if that’s not what he means?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo agonized and agonized by himself, trying not to provoke someone who was angry. In doing so, too much time ended up passing……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even knowing he would look pathetic, he chose to ask once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I’m asking because I’m worried I might have misunderstood, but do you mean come to your house?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon is going to curse at me. What if he gets so pissed off that he tells me to forget about treatment and everything? What if he goes to someone else and asks them to do it…… Yeah, this can’t be helped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo broke out in a cold sweat and just waited for a reply. He had never stared at his phone so intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, Gyeon Gang-hyeon let out a cold, hollow laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What should I do with this blockhead bastard? Even if he understood everything perfectly, it wouldn’t be enough. At this point, I’m starting to think he’s doing it on purpose to piss me off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as anger welled up, imagining that rigid face struggling made him feel better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who belatedly realized that his mouth corners hadn’t gone back down even after the hollow laugh had faded, finally poured his anger into his reply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Come]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Come and explain yourself]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His emotions were swinging back and forth like a seesaw, getting angry then calming down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what was even more absurd was the next text.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I was in the middle of training, is it okay if I shower first?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What is this bastard saying right now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It sounded extremely filthy, suspicious, and creepy!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did tension come rushing back. His hair stood on end, and goosebumps rose all the way to his fingertips and toes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been too complacent until just now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So…… Ja Hyeong-woo had been keeping him alive all along. Surely his yang energy hadn’t suddenly become insufficient recently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And it had been well over half a year since he had awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To briefly recall that terrible scene, that thing Ja Hyeong-woo was doing to him while he slept…… didn’t it look quite practiced?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His breathing gradually became short. He covered his mouth with his hand and pressed down. Because he started thinking about how much Ja Hyeong-woo might have sucked on these very lips all this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is why, because of this, I tried not to think about it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once he had thought of it, no matter what he did, he couldn’t go back to how it was before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What had he made the original protagonist do, and for how long, to his childhood friend? His head felt dizzy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And even now…… Ja Hyeong-woo was coming to do that thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The floor he was looking down at became blurry. His vision trembled. Gyeon Gang-hyeon panted for a moment then plopped down just like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What kind of pathetically weak body is this? Do I really have to sell even my lips to survive after all this…… If it’s going to be like this, just tell me to sell my body……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was funny that he had felt not too bad for a moment. He wanted to beat himself up thoroughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, Ja Hyeong-woo finished his war-like shower that was both fast and thorough. He roughly patted his obstructive long hair with a towel and opened the chat window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reply was swift.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Snake Successor&gt;Me: Who is this?

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho soon became serious though. The shift to a serious atmosphere was visible even through text.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s the kind of person who does what needs to be done when it needs to be done, so that’s probably why Gang-hyeon keeps him around. The moment he had that thought, jealousy surged up, but he held it back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: I can treat him. Gang-hyeon needs to rest, so don’t come to see him today.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With an anxious heart, he teleported to Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite being prepared, the moment he saw the statue-like figure sitting with legs crossed on the sofa, his heart sank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A cold and sharp atmosphere flowed from the house owner, as if he might fillet flesh with a knife. He didn’t even look at Ja Hyeong-woo, nor did he speak first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I came to make excuses.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And also for treatment…… But should he kneel down first? Ja Hyeong-woo reflexively thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Gyeon Gang-hyeon suddenly raised his head. He shot a look so ruthlessly cold that even seeing a mortal enemy would probably be gentler.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I don’t want to hear your explanation. If I listen to that, I’ll get so pissed I’ll die.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had nothing to say even if he had ten mouths. But he did feel a hollow emptiness, as if his chest was being emptied out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Earlier he had texted him to explain himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Making him hope that maybe if he spoke well, he might be forgiven.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then suddenly not letting him even open his mouth, without realizing that Gyeon Gang-hyeon had become depressed by some other thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When I draw energy, I can do it just by holding hands. So couldn’t yang energy work similarly? How much difference would it make if we just held hands?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The intention to somehow reduce contact with him was obvious. He must also hate touching him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo consciously opened his chest wider to accept that fact. Only cold wind kept entering. It felt like needles were being stuck densely into the empty space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, even so, he couldn’t not tell him the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since you started leader work and got affiliated hunters, your energy has become more insufficient. ……If we just hold hands, we’d have to hold hands 24 hours a day, every single day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perplexity and disappointment appeared on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face. And the moment he witnessed that clearly with his own two eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strong rebellious feeling suddenly bloomed beneath Ja Hyeong-woo’s chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he had no right to feel that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Or we do it below instead of kissing. I’ll do the most efficient thing possible and finish it in the shortest time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you’re going to be so disgusted, if you’re going to kiss me with a face that says you’d rather die, then let’s do this instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo lowered his head and continued speaking slowly, trying to appear as calm as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll take my cock out from inside my pants and spray semen on you…… receive yang energy from there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if being sexually harassed, Gyeon Gang-hyeon turned deathly pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While a sense of helplessness at having made a grave mistake washed over him, Ja Hyeong-woo paradoxically felt a twisted satisfaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t talk nonsense. Are you crazy? What, what are you saying you’ll do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I said I’d take out my cock and masturbate. And that I’d ejaculate on your bare back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You weren’t decent after all, you’re insane.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With an innocent face, he couldn’t even get the words out of his mouth properly and was utterly shocked. Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had bolted upright, hesitated then plopped back down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His empty hands clenched and unclenched into fists, trembling finely. Was he thinking he needed to grab some kind of weapon to defend himself?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Yes, hate me instead. This is right.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere he had created was terrible. In the silence, Ja Hyeong-woo experienced what it felt like to be a sinner falling into hell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Take off your shirt and turn around.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An unprecedentedly coercive tone pressed down on Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Frozen eyes looked up at Ja Hyeong-woo in a complete mess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s face was somewhat red, but his expression alone was calm. It was even menacing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, this time Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t try to escape with his usual cursing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll guarantee the treatment’s effectiveness. You don’t have to do anything, I just have to do it. What could be better than this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This might be the first time Gyeon Gang-hyeon had yielded to Ja Hyeong-woo’s will.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right before his eyes, Gang-hyeon grabbed his own clothing ties. The clothes on his shoulders slipped down, gradually revealing white, translucent skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His bare body, still without muscle, looked completely delicate and bluish. Under the arms that moved to lower his clothes, only smooth skin without a single hair could be seen. Gyeon Gang-hyeon, having removed his upper garment, turned around on the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Ja Hyeong-woo’s semen would be flowing down that back with its deeply curved spine, untouched by other hands and spotless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……So you really think that’s better than kissing me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo pulled out his cock while standing in that spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under the lighting, the large flesh pillar bounced heavily out of the cloth. A shadow formed on the floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha, ugh, hoo……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Schlick schlick, the sound of flesh rubbing was occasionally mixed with the wet noise of precum. Along with Ja Hyeong-woo’s breathing sounds too. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s white ears turned bright red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in this situation, Ja Hyeong-woo could get an erection apparently. The thought crossed his mind that that bastard really was a man. Who would have thought he’d end up listening to Ja Hyeong-woo masturbating right next to him?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon clenched his mouth shut and gritted his teeth. The corners of his eyes trembled and occasionally crumpled. It looked like a tear might drop at any moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just watching that made Ja Hyeong-woo’s cock swell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Haah……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How much time had passed? Following a low sigh, the sound of Ja Hyeong-woo’s footsteps approached. Gyeon Gang-hyeon squeezed his eyes shut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A stream of lukewarm semen that felt like it was being poured from a bottle beat against his back. His entire back quickly became soaked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensation of thick mucus flowing down while stickily carving a path was vivid to a horrifying degree.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But more than that, just now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did he rub against me……?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was just for an instant, but it seemed like a glans with an area too chilling to even think about had rubbed against his back before falling away.
 </span>
