  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 133
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon still hadn’t recognized any visual scenery in front of him. Looking only at Ja Hyeong-woo’s bewildered eyes, he shouted angrily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You, you! You thoughtless bastard. Why did you vote for me? Why did you do that?! Do you really think I should become leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The place, the presence before his eyes, and his own state clouded Ja Hyeong-woo’s reason like steam. Hot blood boiled fiercely beneath his jaw. He barely managed to feign calmness and responded to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do it. You lead me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unintentionally, but with eyes that looked very sensual to Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon froze as if he’d been hit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…It’s irony, right? He’s saying let’s see how well I do, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If those words were sincere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That doesn’t make sense. How much harsh language have I used on that guy until now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had stepped back blankly, only then noticed Ja Hyeong-woo’s moist half-nakedness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah! You fucking pervert!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He immediately had a fit and shot out like an arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo bit down on the laughter blooming inside his lips and looked at the door Gyeon Gang-hyeon had left through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he’d said ‘wait there for a moment until I come out,’ Gang-hyeon would probably have been more flustered. Unfortunately, he’d already vanished.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He felt like he was gradually learning how to handle Gang-hyeon. Learning that, contrary to his thoughts, rather than rejecting him, Gang-hyeon was only showing confusion about what to do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The original protagonist didn’t become leader. I ruined the world. South Korea is finished.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Separate from Gyeon Gang-hyeon being pale blue and falling into a temporary panic state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had no interest in the leader position from the beginning. It was the same in the original work, that is, in the timeline where he would be granted the leader role by Woo Sae-geon. He just did it because he was told to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just yesterday, he had been sitting not on his own bed but on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s bed. Listening worriedly to his faint breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As his guilt had grown too great, recently Ja Hyeong-woo no longer did the shameless act of penetrating the mouth of a sleeping person. He didn’t even touch him with his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He just stimulated his own cock with his own hands and smeared that bodily fluid on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s exposed arms and such, then wiped it clean to fix the treatment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, still far from being upright, Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t stop his increasingly lewd imagination day by day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like recalling the sensation of kneading the white, round buttocks that were the only place with flesh on his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When his hand stroking his cock up and down would become slippery, in his imagination he eventually climbed onto the body of the one sleeping beside him, stripped him naked, spread his legs, and inserted his flesh pillar inside. Ja Hyeong-woo vividly drew out that entire process in his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then reaching climax, with thoughts of wanting to beat himself to death, he desperately organized all his sexual desire and left the soundly sleeping Gyeon Gang-hyeon behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These days, didn’t he inevitably have dreams where Gang-hyeon looked at him lovingly and accepted everything he did, and not wake up? As a result, he invariably had to see his lower body dried white.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was aware he’d gone crazy. That made it more agonizing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while thinking he should now confess his secret to Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Ja Hyeong-woo postponed it again, worried about making the busy Gyeon Gang-hyeon suffer needlessly with talk of being leader and such.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The selfishness of wanting to settle for the current unwholesome peace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When it’s actually because of sordid greed.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A lie that had grown too big over time because of his greed not to lose him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he wasn’t forgiven, it would be precisely because Ja Hyeong-woo had truly enjoyed it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then would it be better to hide it until retirement? When he retired, he’d naturally no longer need to do it, so even if it was somewhat dangerous, if he just wasn’t caught until then, he might be able to bury what he’d done forever.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t want to deceive him for life.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If they became distant after retirement, that might be different, but he wouldn’t want to end things that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The emotions that had once been covered with disappointment toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon had become a vast ocean again. Now Ja Hyeong-woo devoted all his attention to every moment he was with Gyeon Gang-hyeon. To the extent it interfered with combat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To the point where if their eyes met, he might unconsciously say out loud, “Pretty.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time Gyeon Gang-hyeon showed a flustered reaction to the pointed words Ja Hyeong-woo uttered, he had to endure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if we parted like that in elementary school, when our bodies grew and we met again, and came to be together.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That things would flow this way was already decided from then. Like fate, no matter how much Gang-hyeon had changed, no matter how cruelly he acted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And actually, he’d come to realize that Cheon Gang-hyeon hadn’t changed that much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The greed that densely covered his being, he clearly spoke aloud. Just speaking made his chest tingle and his body tense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I want to be the most precious existence to Gang-hyeon, and I hope Gang-hyeon desires me just as I do him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lover, marriage. Any words would be fine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is it possible for me to captivate Gang-hyeon in a sexual sense?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Around the time Ja Hyeong-woo was asking himself this unfunny question, Gyeon Gang-hyeon also asked him something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you really think I should become leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t particularly want Gyeon Gang-hyeon to become responsible for the school. Not because Gyeon Gang-hyeon was lacking. Just because he worried about him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Are you really going to be okay?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, Ja Hyeong-woo felt elation instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having passed through the time of being ignored as a delinquent, he was trying to lead people even with his frail body. The one person who had been the coolest in Ja Hyeong-woo’s world, and was still cool now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Give me any order. If you tell me to die, I’ll die.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He always wanted to pull Gyeon Gang-hyeon close and kiss him. Though his desire was impure, at least he knew it came from pure feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was elated in the moment you were recognized by people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon pointed to me. That’s 40% there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And in the successor signatures, everyone except me gave consent votes. This adds another 30%…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regardless of the general student vote, I’m already elected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No. I don’t know yet.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shook my head vigorously. I clung to the last hope like grasping at straws.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the students’ 30% couldn’t overturn the result, if the vast majority of general students opposed it, reconsideration would still take place. Student opinions couldn’t be completely ignored.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The students won’t vote for anyone. Right? Don’t you recock the old Gyeon Gang-hyeon? Getting drunk and lying around throwing tantrums?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This evening, the secret ballot results hosted through the system arrived. I opened it with trembling hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And.

  [We announce that Dog Successor has been finally elected as the 2nd Student Council President.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the announcement broadcast rang in my ears, I fumbled through the status window with trembling hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Association Inquiry]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was seriously considering filing an objection with the association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This vote is invalid. It’s not fair! Because former leader Woo Sae-geon had already chosen ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon,’ students might have been influenced by that and chosen in favor regardless of their own opinions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, on the other hand, I had already entered a half-resigned stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I struggled in denial, was there anything I could change at this point?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A festival was already happening without me.

  I angrily flipped through pages. But while clicking and reading various community posts, I discovered something unusual. My face naturally scrunched up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Which bastard is calling me Ja Hyeong-woo’s wife?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was a more serious matter than even the current leader incident. Whose ID is this bastard? While obsessively digging through posts, I soon realized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t just one or two doing this. In the community, ‘Ja Hyeong-woo’s wife’ was already a term meaning Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Ja Hyeong-woo was being called something like the world’s greatest devoted husband and supportive healer.
