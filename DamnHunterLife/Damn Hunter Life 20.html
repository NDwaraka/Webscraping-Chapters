  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 20
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had upright features that suggested he wouldn’t cut corners, but his impression couldn’t be called gentle even as flattery.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was also due to his physique that often led to mistaken assumptions that he’d been an athlete before becoming a hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he went out on the streets, you could easily find as many people who flinched and avoided his large frame as those who looked at his appearance. He rarely smiled and had a personality that didn’t embellish words or make excuses, making him prone to misunderstandings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Such a person, though unintentionally, waited for Hae Mi-jun’s answer with interrogating eyes. Hae Mi-jun had to hold his breath to prevent hiccups.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does it… show? That it wasn’t entirely accomplished through my own strength alone……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about it briefly, it made sense. Ja Hyeong-woo, and perhaps even Woo Sae-geon, anyone even slightly perceptive would notice there was someone behind Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What could his timid and weak self have accomplished alone in the first place?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But if that finger-pointing extends to my subordinates, I won’t stand for it either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll substitute.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wasn’t the type to speak such words purely from his own thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was all because Gang-hyeon hyung was there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun firmly believed that everything up until now was a miracle that happened because he tried to emulate Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And under Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze, Hae Mi-jun truly wanted to tear his hair out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to say it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I want to say it. That Gang-hyeon hyung helped me, that Gang-hyeon hyung is really different from the image known so far. Though I’d be too embarrassed to mention even that breathing training method……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun kept his mouth firmly shut. He couldn’t bring himself to look Ja Hyeong-woo straight in the eyes and lie, so he lowered his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was… lucky. Working hard alone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I see.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo nodding without particular suspicion was fortunate yet terribly regrettable at the same time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Please be suspicious instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s all thanks to Gang-hyeon hyung… He felt tormented that he couldn’t reveal how hyung had done various things for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only Gang-hyeon hyung hadn’t made such a request…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, listen carefully. Even if people ask questions because of your performance today, even if interviews come in, I’d prefer if you didn’t talk about me as much as possible.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That much? Why? To Hae Mi-jun’s wide-open eyes, Gyeon Gang-hyeon who had been answering…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looked so much like a ‘hyung.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I need to remain with an incompetent image as long as possible. That way successors will focus more on growth to fill my position.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before feeling disappointed by that choice, Hae Mi-jun was moved by finally learning Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s intention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So even while harboring guilt about lying, he hid the truth in front of Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was stealing someone else’s credit. It didn’t suit Hae Mi-jun’s nature. Having to blow away with his own mouth the opportunity for Gang-hyeon hyung to be properly recognized made his heart ache.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been in casual clothes, loosened his arm muscles lightly and moved to change into hunter gear. Then he glanced back at Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go to the training ground first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was referring to the successors’ training ground, not the general hunter training ground Hae Mi-jun had been attending.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Hae Mi-jun had voluntarily avoided that place, the successors hadn’t repeatedly invited him either. But now, Ja Hyeong-woo was bringing it up again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Still don’t want to come? They’ll be waiting for a new healer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s face brightened. He nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll go!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun flew out of Ja Hyeong-woo’s house first. His steps going to train couldn’t be lighter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now he could confidently straighten his shoulders and enter the Twelve Zodiac training ground. Since he’d been recognized as a colleague, they might even do joint training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before that, just one more thank you to Gang-hyeon hyung…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His fingers touching his phone suddenly stiffened. Hae Mi-jun looked up at the artificial sky inside Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon hyung… when will he be able to awaken?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m fine suffering more here, so I want to give Gang-hyeon hyung even my abilities. If only we could awaken together and be in the same training ground, I’d have no other wishes…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun sincerely wished for the day when hyung would quickly clear his false accusations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But hyung might not be swayed by what others say at all. That was really difficult for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes it even seems like he enjoys it…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Oops, I thought about hyung too long. Remembering training, Hae Mi-jun soon shook his head and walked diligently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Around that time, Ja Hyeong-woo was looking at his face with the dark circles completely gone in the mirror once more, while inwardly thinking of something completely different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He doesn’t even come to visit.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was thinking of exactly the same person who had just left Ja Hyeong-woo’s house, but his emotions were the complete opposite.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Ja Hyeong-woo collapsed in front of Stage 26’s entrance, the raid team had no choice but to enter the gate… but the students at Hunter School were in an uproar. All of South Korea was stirred up until it was announced that he had simply fallen asleep and there was nothing wrong with his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But you, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, didn’t even come to check though you can enter my house.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I heard you collapsed, even if it happened because you were drunk, I’d go check if you were okay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even that dawn when we met at the restaurant, wasn’t it me who brought you to your room when you were lying drunk on the street?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s when it happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Hey, are you awake?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A text came. It was Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression hardened as he hurriedly unlocked it to check the content.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Did I tell you to collapse like an attention seeker when I said work hard?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I said work hard while managing your body]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Isn’t the most incompetent healer one who can’t take care of his own body?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [This is like not having the basics down]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [And if you’re going to slack off from now on just because Hae Mi-jun grew a bit, just die]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The intention of not bothering to fix the typo before sending was very clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo closed his phone without even writing a reply in the chat room where the read receipt had appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fine. I’ll train to become an even better healer. Until you have nothing left to say.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had rapid-fired texts to motivate Ja Hyeong-woo, was also feeling something strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not about Ja Hyeong-woo, but about Ja Hyeong-woo’s familiar Squeaky, whom he’d half-enslaved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why haven’t you said a word lately?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Have you finally decided to shut up and support my great cause? You’re actually helpful when you just stay quiet and only provide water attribute. Even when Gyeon Gang-hyeon chattered half-provokingly, the mouse familiar stayed quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But actually, the mouse familiar had been burying itself obediently in its pouch, enduring several times when rebellious outbursts almost burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar had been quietly watching Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s actions. Approaching Jin Seol-woon and changing him, and before that, giving Hae Mi-jun courage and helping with training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, the Gyeon Gang-hyeon the mouse familiar had been seeing was quite different from the Gyeon Gang-hyeon known through school rumors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You substitute for Ja Hyeong-woo. You can do it, Hae Mi-jun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Here the mouse familiar was convinced.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, Gyeon Gang-hyeon is a threat to master Ja Hyeong-woo!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Master is already there as an excellent healer, yet you’re making another healer? Plus saying substitute? I’ve figured out all your schemes.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You must be planning to covet and bring down my master’s status! The mouse familiar ground its front teeth helplessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar resolved again today. It would find an opportunity to properly teach this guy a lesson.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that Ja Hyeong-woo, its master, wouldn’t have to see himself being manipulated by such a person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Twelve Zodiac successors’ meeting room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the place where several people usually shared raid feedback, unusually only one person sat. He occupied the round table alone, chin propped on his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The openly acknowledged leader of the Twelve Zodiac who commanded all stage raids, Ox successor Woo Sae-geon, was perfectly dressed today too with his topknot tied and gray robe draped. As always, his brain was busy working alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successors are fundamentally connected. Especially successors of the same attribute could feel each other’s energy even from afar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Based on this premise, Woo Sae-geon had been holding his breath and sensing energy for several days after Stage 26 ended. And today, he was finally certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Earth is wavering.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this unprecedented phenomenon, Woo Sae-geon recalled the earth attribute successors who comprised 4 of the Twelve Zodiac one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First there was himself, but he had experienced no changes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next was Sheep successor Yang Pyo. If something was strange with that guy, he would have scurried over to tell him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Dragon successor Jin Seol-woon. He was more likely than the previous two. He was more capable than Yang Pyo, and being naturally taciturn, he might be hiding something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But… there was another possibility too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who had been tapping the table with his index finger, soon summoned someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A tall man slipped into the meeting room quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wasn’t a successor but Woo Sae-geon’s capable subordinate, a regular hunter named Choi Jung-do. Woo Sae-geon looked up at him and spoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s awakening is suspected.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The earth attribute was more unstable than usual, but it didn’t feel ominous. It felt like the scale was expanding overall. At the positive sensation of power’s range extending, Woo Sae-geon formed this hypothesis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So that’s why he chose to come out into the world. Having awakened, he could act arrogantly in front of broadcast reporters unlike before.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the time when Gyeon Gang-hyeon interviewed with the reporter was several weeks before now. He’d already been awakened since then?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If it’s true that he awakened, then he’s abandoned his duty as a successor and hidden his awakening.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Choi Jung-do. You go find out whether Gyeon Gang-hyeon has awakened or not.”
 </span>
</p>
