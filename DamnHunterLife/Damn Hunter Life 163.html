  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 163
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even at this moment, the sleeping one was tightly holding Sa Ye-ho’s hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho gestured lightly toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon as if showing off, his lips twitching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It wasn’t me. Gang-hyeon grabbed it, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was a human who had survived even under Yoon Sae-geon. The jealousy of some same-age muscular guy was just laughable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, his face is even more awful than Sae-geon hyung’s. Sa Ye-ho turned his gaze away with an “ugh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Smooth out your expression. Did you think you’d get it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did the murderous aura flowing from Ja Hyeong-woo subside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not the one holding it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really not.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo approached with heavy steps. He tried hard to replace Sa Ye-ho’s hand with his own without waking Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Three men’s hands got tangled. Sa Ye-ho pushed him away with his foot, hating to touch Ja Hyeong-woo even if he died. Ja Hyeong-woo lunged as if to cut off Sa Ye-ho’s hand. The traditional Korean clothes rustled as they wrestled back and forth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, he’ll wake up! Move, damn it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the one being loud and waking him. You’re the one who should get lost.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you see Gang-hyeon is holding it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ja Hyeong-woo froze first. Huh? Sa Ye-ho turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had woken from sleep, was staring blankly at the two guys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good morning~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who smiled brightly, hugged Gyeon Gang-hyeon as if pouncing on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon only made an “uh…” sound and didn’t push Sa Ye-ho away. Only Ja Hyeong-woo, who couldn’t say anything, turned red and blue in the face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho lay next to me and chattered by himself for a while (I guess he’s not even afraid of Ja Hyeong-woo), then when I complained of fatigue, he squeezed my hand once and left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Our Gang-mouse, tell oppa if you need his hand again~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get lost.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Me and Ja Hyeong-woo said it at the same time, exactly the same. I was flustered by that, and Ja Hyeong-woo was satisfied.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho laughed at me with a “puhak” and then left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as the door closed, I collapsed onto the bed with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, having Sa Ye-ho visit gives a little vitality… what vitality.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s presence staying beside me is so overwhelming that I can’t think of anything else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had grabbed Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand in my sleep earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Sa Ye-ho, not Ja Hyeong-woo, but anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had unconsciously sought him out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like if someone stabbed something, even if it was a mannequin, that intent would be recognized and judged as attempted murder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was so disturbed that I thought of such an inappropriate analogy. It was uncomfortable how Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t leave my side as if it were natural.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no idea whether that bastard had eaten anything proper or slept during this time. First of all, the dark circles under his eyes were too deep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After maintaining silence quietly, I opened my mouth and barely managed the first words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won’t you go? Don’t you have work to do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ungratefully, I snapped at the healer who had been nursing me with utmost devotion all this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Nothing’s more important than this. I’m not going.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo spoke firmly, as if expecting me to say more. He didn’t seem like he’d back down easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll serve me for life?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was really meaningless, just something I said to be annoying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo looked at me with a serious face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…If you’ll allow it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I deliberately avoided his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words I just heard were pounding in my head, crushing all other thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The S-grade sword broke, and the sensation that followed crushed and twisted my consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The cold flames that had burned even my heart were extinguished, and what remained was a body exhausted like ashes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And thoughts. Thoughts about essence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had avoided the answer to who I am for far too long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While sleeping as if dead, I reached out and struggled to find anything I could remember.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why I was tired when I woke up. I had no strength in my hands and feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to use earth attribute skills again. Can a body really be this heavy?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Ja Hyeong-woo hadn’t deliberately woken me up and fed me, I would have died long ago.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the dark night, I woke to a loud sound. It was the sound of me coughing. A sudden fit of coughing burst out and I clutched my chest while hacking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think I had a dream. I don’t remember the content.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s frustrating. Even though there’s actually nothing stuck in my throat, I kept trying to cough something up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cough, hack, gasp.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Far from subsiding, the coughing got worse as time passed. The sound of struggling for breath grew louder. I coughed dryly while lying face-up, then turned over with difficulty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A warm wall touched in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While crouched against the wall coughing, I realized it was Ja Hyeong-woo’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then, while gasping and trying to turn my body again, an arm wrapped around from behind. I was held firmly in that state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hot hands gently stroked my back. I finished coughing against Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha, huk.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Physiological tears welled up. While wiping them with my sleeve, Ja Hyeong-woo moved in the darkness. He slowly sat me up and gave me warm water to drink.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t even known Ja Hyeong-woo was lying beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after my breathing difficulties were resolved, our position didn’t change. A clean, good smell came from Ja Hyeong-woo’s embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should get up. I should get up… My body relaxed from the warm body temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouldn’t get used to this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t ask a single question like why I was coughing when I didn’t even have a cold. Without making a fuss, he skillfully gave me what I needed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This sense of security is like poison.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rested my head against Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest as if I were in a grave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo maintained strength in his arms so Gyeon Gang-hyeon could calm down and fall asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the peace of the being in his arms, he would be fine dying torn to pieces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wished some omnipotent being would crush his heart and give it to Gyeon Gang-hyeon as life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Holding him brought back the sorrowful memories from inside the stage. Ja Hyeong-woo faced the painful fragments of the past that his mind dragged up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he was desperately doing embarrassing things to extract yang energy to give to Gyeon Gang-hyeon…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Han Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had suddenly come to his senses, called Ja Hyeong-woo. Then he looked into his eyes and said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if I fail and can’t save anyone… I’ll save you even if I have to trade myself for it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What kind of talk is that? Ja Hyeong-woo asked in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He should have pressed him right there, but there was no time for that. Gyeon Gang-hyeon fainted again. Ja Hyeong-woo had to continue what he was doing with confused feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after regaining consciousness later, Gyeon Gang-hyeon seemed not to remember what he had said at the time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he had barely slept, he only felt his eyes were slightly tired but wasn’t sleepy. Ja Hyeong-woo quietly held Gyeon Gang-hyeon until dawn broke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Gyeon Gang-hyeon stirred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo loosened his arms slightly. He didn’t look down but remained lost in thought a little longer. Letting his mind drift to the pale dawn light coming through the curtains.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A long silence stretched. Gyeon Gang-hyeon remained trapped in his embrace, only wiggling his fingers slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only when Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s voice flowed out cutting through the darkness did Ja Hyeong-woo look down at the round crown of his head below his chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Before, when I cursed at you, told you to just train, and didn’t pay attention to you… It wasn’t because I hated you. Of course, it’s not like you never made me angry or annoyed me…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After rambling quietly, he soon added that he was sorry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s second apology.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo thought of the young Gyeon Gang-hyeon from the time he had missed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also the Gyeon Gang-hyeon from a year ago, whom he had turned away from.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon noticed that Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest was rising and falling more greatly and unstably than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t need to apologize.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The air entering and leaving Ja Hyeong-woo’s lungs became more turbulent. Gyeon Gang-hyeon raised his eyes, accustomed to the darkness, to look at his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he was startled and immediately snapped his head down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t have the courage to look up again. His heart was pounding wildly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why can’t you understand. If I can’t make you understand because I’m not good with words, I wish someone else would appear and tell you. That you’re someone who deserves to be worried about. That it’s okay, if someone could make you understand…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His words trailed off and cracked roughly. But they didn’t break.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was consuming enormous energy to spit out each and every word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I said I did it on purpose because I wanted you to become a good healer. But I never wanted to be a hero. If becoming strong meant receiving your hatred, I’d absolutely never do it. Even if the world ended, I want to win your heart. That’s the kind of person I am.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a confession staking his entire life, and a yearning directed at Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You who say hurtful things are also you. I love all of it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon listened to those words silently. They were words that demanded as much mental strength from the listener as from the speaker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even without answering, he chose to listen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I used to hate you sometimes. But now, everything except you is resentful. Why do you have to hurt? What should I do so you never hurt again? I’m going crazy… I have to see your face.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence pressed down on the room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t disappointed in Gyeon Gang-hyeon for not saying a word. He wiped his face with his sleeve and smiled gently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you need to sleep more? Want to get up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo prepared an early morning meal. Meanwhile, Gyeon Gang-hyeon carefully opened an internet portal. It was the first time in five days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he skimmed news and column titles expecting all sorts of bad words like controversy, demands for explanation, staying holed up, seclusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon threw his phone onto the bed with a loud thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His head was full of question marks.
 </span>
