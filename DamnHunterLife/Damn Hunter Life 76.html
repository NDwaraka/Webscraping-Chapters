  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 76
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In appearance and age, the Ja Hyeong-woo before my eyes almost perfectly matched the one I knew. The shape of the staff in his hand and the water energy flowing from it were the same too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, I’m certain this is a hallucination. Because of his expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get up. Try doing it properly again. You can’t heal inside like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With a cold, heartless face, Ja Hyeong-woo scolds someone. Only then did the form of the person Ja Hyeong-woo was talking to appear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. I’ll try once more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had guessed from when he said heal, but it was indeed Hae Mi-jun. Similarly almost like the Hae Mi-jun I know, but his face seemed darker and more gaunt than in reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was sweating profusely while concentrating on his attribute weapon. Even though his hands kept slipping and his body trembled, he didn’t say he would stop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he’s been unable to create a single skill for months, he wouldn’t say he’d rest first even if he collapsed and died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo just watched without any emotion as the child struggled desperately like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve taught what I can teach, so do it until you succeed. I also have training, so I don’t have time to keep watching. Let’s meet again when there’s progress.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo turned around. He disappeared behind another rock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching Hae Mi-jun left alone, I felt embarrassed just looking. At least say his effort is admirable. That damn bastard made Hae Mi-jun cry and left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s why there were hints of Hae Mi-jun’s dark turn in the original work…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I was wondering whether to watch Hae Mi-jun more or follow the disappeared Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Swoosh… Someone’s clothing brushed past behind me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even knowing it was a hallucination, that sensation was so vivid it gave me goosebumps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I turned my head, Ja Hyeong-woo’s hard profile swept past me. Another hallucination, another scene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His sleeves and legs were soaked with blood. At that sight, I followed blindly. His stride was long and fast, so I had to almost run to keep up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor-nim, the blood…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not my blood. Are there more injured?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Six regular hunters over there, many more civilians… And Jin Seol-woon Successor-nim and Myo Cho-hui Successor-nim are injured.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please guide me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who was about to walk faster, stopped when I grabbed his sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That is your blood.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood drops flowing from his sleeve made a red trail on the back of my hand. Ja Hyeong-woo’s dry eyes turned toward my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you injured? If not, please let go. I’m busy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems when I fall into hallucinations, I also become a character in that scene. He probably recognizes me as one of the civilians who was there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I continued speaking quietly to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo. This is a hallucination. It was an event scheduled to happen, not something that actually occurred.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s lines, his current blood-soaked state, and the mentioned injured people were all as I knew them. I knew exactly which part of the original work this was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The actual Busan Gate will end with only one injured successor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Namely, me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, a character who was already dead – Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Seeing hallucinations doesn’t mean I see memories from before my possession.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, the gate extracted the memory I was most concerned about and showed it to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s just that what I call the original work is my fake memory and prior information I possess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So even if I fall into hallucinations, I can wake up quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stupid bastard. Your body needs to be fine to treat others. Are you going around like this because one heal skill is precious?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been staring at me blankly, suddenly collapsed on the spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The illusion scattered like a sand castle. I stood alone on the rocky mountain I had first seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…This isn’t a hallucination now, right? Since it disappeared before my eyes, this time it’s real?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like shouting “this is a dream” in a dream makes you wake up, hallucinations could be escaped using similar methods.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time I moved actively. To find where Ja Hyeong-woo was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While comparing the descriptions in my memory with the surrounding environment and going deeper, I scattered white sand to mark the path. Though I came in a hurry, I was also familiar with basic conquest rules.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Seeing no one else marked anything… everyone got caught in hallucinations as soon as they entered the gate and wandered around aimlessly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I told you it would help if I came in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, this is the first time I’ve directly faced the original work’s Ja Hyeong-woo. Maybe because I was flustered, I kept thinking about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to the original description, that side was more blade-like and bleak in everything. Should I say he was similar to Woo Sae-geon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But seeing him directly, I understand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was just having no leisure. No leisure to care for others and show kindness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What’s different between the two Ja Hyeong-woos, what was missing in that original bastard that made him like that…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Come to think of it, where did Woo Sae-geon go?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original work didn’t show what Woo Sae-geon saw in hallucinations. His past wasn’t dealt with in the first place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, it shows he regained his senses quite quickly and searched for Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I find Ja Hyeong-woo, and Woo Sae-geon finds the other hunters. If he can’t do that, strip Woo Sae-geon’s leader badge.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How many tens of minutes did I search around? Some luck seemed to follow too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, I found Ja Hyeong-woo standing with his soul in another world, completely out of it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey. Ja Hyeong-woo. You mouse bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No answer when I called.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I waved my hand in front of his blank face. He seemed unable to see me at all. He was so completely immersed in the hallucination that he didn’t even flinch. Blinking was the only movement Ja Hyeong-woo showed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to what I saw in the original work, if you give a shock greater than the hallucination, you can immediately wake someone fallen into hallucinations. As long as it’s before they’re completely consumed and can never escape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Woo Sae-geon finds Ja Hyeong-woo… that crazy human will cut his colleague with a sword just enough not to kill him to get him out.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What do I do? I don’t want to fall to the same level as Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, I’ll just beat him up. Let me try what I couldn’t do until now. Slap his cheek, hit his solar plexus, and if that doesn’t work, kick him there too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With an excited heart for the first time in a while, I stood in front of Ja Hyeong-woo—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeon-a.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gasped as a suddenly clear voice flowed out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How… why is he looking straight at me? Just now, was that calling me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who met my eyes, stretched his lips into a smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That alone was creepy enough, but he even opened his mouth slightly and smiled broadly. His blunt, straight eyes became soft with laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeon-a. You came? I was waiting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was stunned by his beaming face, then suddenly came to my senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without knowing it, the surrounding scenery had completely changed 180 degrees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should have gotten Ja Hyeong-woo out of the hallucination, but while I was hesitating, he pulled me in with him instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No, it’s fine. At least I’m aware this is a hallucination, so I can get out again quickly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then let me get ahead of visual information and predict what will appear in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hallucination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s hallucination shown in the original work was childhood memories. And Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These two scenes alternated, leaving Ja Hyeong-woo with emptiness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But there, memories of my death were missing. If only the first part remains…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I knew it, the Ja Hyeong-woo before my eyes had disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the large figure blocking my view gone, I could see the surroundings at a glance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An unfamiliar neighborhood where red brick villas were closely packed together. Cigarette butts and trash were scattered in the narrow alley. The recycling station was placed without separation from the road, and telephone wires messily covered the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I fixed my wandering gaze on a small child sitting on the entrance step of ‘Miso Villa.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I found myself staring intently without realizing it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A stretched t-shirt and worn-out sneakers. Long hair grown shaggy as if not being cared for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But his expression isn’t dark. He seems to be waiting expectantly for someone…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tap tap tap tap—!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the short, light sound of sneakers hitting the ground approaches like lightning from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small kid who passed right through me, not even reaching my waist in height.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stared blankly at the child whose face resembled mine too much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Han Hyeong-woo! I’m here!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the resounding high voice, Ja Hyeong-woo jumped up. He grinned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Little Gyeon Gang-hyeon put both hands on his waist and stood right in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There wasn’t even a speck of wind in the gate. Since even clothing didn’t flutter, Woo Sae-geon standing still was even more like a statue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “×××, shit…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his soul helplessly captured elsewhere, a language he absolutely never uses here slipped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A state where he gripped his sword tightly as if to swing it immediately but couldn’t advance at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From opposite him, suddenly some figure pushed away Woo Sae-geon’s dark hallucination and asserted their presence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon lifted his head to look at his opponent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then for the first time, movement appeared in Woo Sae-geon’s pupils. They vibrated faintly, then focus returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, this is a gate. All the scenes until now were illusions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he met that man before his eyes after coming to Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You followed…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He gained realization midway and cut off his words. Simultaneously, the man also disappeared smoothly as if mocking Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon let out a hollow laugh. Even that was a hallucination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to seeing that grinning face, his mind did clear up though.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon lightly twisted his neck to loosen his muscles, then sharply rolled his eyes the next moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A chat came in with the Dog Successor’s name, but now isn’t the time to check such things. Woo Sae-geon moved his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after sweeping through the gate and rescuing half the hunters fallen into hallucinations did he learn the seriousness of the chat Gyeon Gang-hyeon left.
 </span>
