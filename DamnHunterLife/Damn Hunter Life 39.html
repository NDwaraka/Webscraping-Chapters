</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Sa Ye-ho was having a one-person debate on ‘Why the hell are cup noodles so delicious,’ he tore off the lid of a small cup of cup noodles. Steam rose up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Want to make a bet? Whether it’ll splatter on your white clothes or not while you finish the cup noodles.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was stirring the noodles, Sa Ye-ho butted in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Three hundred thousand points on ‘it’ll splatter.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I bet first without hesitation and put the noodles in my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, you’re betting the house deed. Me too on ‘it’ll splatter.’ Hey, then the bet doesn’t work. Just fucking pour the broth all over your clothes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How did you know? I use disposable white traditional clothes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m curious, why do you only wear white traditional clothes all the time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Similar reason to why you crossdress.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not crossdressing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mine’s also a concept, man.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Son, why are you only eating that much?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, do you want to adopt a son like me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop feeding me! Did you skip lunch?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No? I ate deliciously though? Just one bite. Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he really held out chopsticks, I leaned against the backrest and opened my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because we had chemistry as same-age friends that made people chuckle, the chat atmosphere wasn’t too bad despite troublemaker Gyeon Gang-hyeon being there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the same question kept coming up periodically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —Dog-nim, why did you drink so much back then?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —The private message is closed so I can’t send this, but there are tons of recordings going around of Gyeon-ssi cursing at students while drunk
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —Meanwhile, he covered his face with a hat on CCTV ㅋ
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho wasn’t particularly reacting to such chats, but he wasn’t banning them either…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was clear on screen that my eyes had read the chat. I acted a bit awkward while leaning my head against the backrest and closing my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I was wrong. I think I was pathetic myself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not a lie. It’s ambiguous to apologize since it wasn’t something I, the possessor, did, but I do feel troubled about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho glanced at me with milk bread cream smeared all over his lips. He made a light comment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. That was fucking pathetic.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋWipe the cream off before talking seriously
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like Sa Ye-ho had deliberately gotten cream on himself before speaking. To change the chat atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had finished eating and put my hands down first. When I tried to look at my phone, Sa Ye-ho blocked me with eye signals. He seemed to want me to focus on the broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll end the broadcast when I finish eating. I need to train now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the broadcast is almost over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho talking about new snacks. My impression from watching this guy briefly—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The snack review is a pretense, and I strongly feel he’s reviewing ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Woo Sae-geon disciplined the Twelve Zodiac, Sa Ye-ho was the person who controlled the pace so the atmosphere wouldn’t flow too badly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much he seems like someone with only air in his head, as a 22-year-old senior group member, he also has some role he’s taken on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Bye~. See you again. Hey, you say goodbye too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The camera finally turned off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Leaving me alone for a moment, Sa Ye-ho hummed while cleaning the table thoroughly. He didn’t ask me to help.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No appearance fee? Sorry, but instead of getting permission to broadcast, I agreed to donate all income to Hunter School students.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expected that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho talks so much that chatting with the status window is his hobby.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Comeback in 2 years? That’s fucking long… Viewers will drop off waiting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Broadcasts during school attendance would be uploaded under the Hunter Association’s name, not GO Ye-ho, with a clause that there would be no profit at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, he probably begged the association just to let him broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had finished cleaning the table, plopped down next to me. Without the camera, he didn’t put his arm around my shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Worried about the reaction?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps misunderstanding my silence, he asked with a subtle grin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Not really.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I kept my gaze on the clock inside the restaurant and continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That chat was fake anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho pulled his back off the chair and looked at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I actually knew. That the streaming chat was fake reactions created by AI.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho probably anticipated the chat viewers would write upon seeing me and thoroughly input keywords in advance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, that wasn’t live streaming but just a recording camera. Viewers had never seen me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whoa. How did you know? Ordinary people usually can’t tell the difference!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, it appears in the original work. Sa Ye-ho using this trick.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That time it was for a prank, but I didn’t think Sa Ye-ho would use this method only once, so I suspected it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Decisively, when Sa Ye-ho stopped me from looking at my phone, I was certain. More precisely, he prevented me from checking communities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Gyeon Gang-hyeon was a broadcast guest, the communities should definitely be buzzing, but there was no mention there, and I would have noticed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I counter-deceived Sa Ye-ho who was trying to deceive me. But rather than being upset, Sa Ye-ho just muttered as if his surprise hadn’t faded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You acted seriously knowing it was fake.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, Sa Ye-ho was serious too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time it was being recorded, but even if it was pointless work that wouldn’t leave any video, I would have made the same comments and focused on the fake chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t do it for viewers to see. I did it for you to see.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if broadcasting might seem like ridiculous behavior to others, it’s Sa Ye-ho’s truly important main job, so how could I approach it carelessly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A smile rose on Sa Ye-ho’s face. The smile that seemed distorted for a moment as he tried to close his gaping mouth was a sight never shown during the broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I knew I’d like this bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I showed an openly stiff reaction, Sa Ye-ho seemed to care more about his own joy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I like bastards who draw aggro well. I also like bastards who can be masks.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho touched his phone with one hand without looking and held it out to me. It was a blank keypad screen for entering phone numbers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you like games?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of answering, I took Sa Ye-ho’s phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My impression after all that commotion ended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, Sa Ye-ho was the easiest to win over among the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This guy’s biggest current worry is just… being bored to death because he has no peers with matching codes.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He can’t hang out with regular students because Woo Sae-geon forbade it, saying it would loosen successor discipline.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then what’s with Sa Ye-ho not doing something when Woo Sae-geon says not to?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Hey hey, but can I upload this video later? It came out well.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do whatever. Just tell me before you upload it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to original Gang-hyeon’s influence, my house has a separate game room. But what good is having such a thing? When Sa Ye-ho suggested gaming from that evening, I had no energy. I collapse after coming home from successor training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Sa Ye-ho is at his place, and I’m lying on my bed watching Sa Ye-ho game alone and keeping him company in conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While others don’t have enough time to train, this guy games non-stop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you train… never mind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, the repertoire I use every time I encounter Ja Hyeong-woo almost came out. I just shut my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had both game screen and face cam displayed together as if broadcasting, even though it was just the two of us playing. Sa Ye-ho’s gaming face was in the bottom right, and I was shown in the top left with my hair spread on the pillow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m gaming after coming from training, you know?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I suppose so.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While everyone voluntarily trains until late at night, he alone probably left work on time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“My comparison target is Cheon-ah, so I just need to follow as much as Cheon-ah does.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That talent-gifted bastard is annoying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah of the same fire attribute has to work hard to do that, while Sa Ye-ho can achieve the same with half-hearted effort.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“If I do too well, Cheon-ah gets impatient. I just need to be moderate~ a little worse than Cheon-ah.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, if Jin Seol-woon’s main job is singing, this guy’s main job is gaming.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s character cheerfully slaughtered mobs on screen. Finding the movement section to the boss battle boring, Sa Ye-ho chattered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What did you do before becoming a hunter? Did you go to college or not?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho is the first person to ask me this. Hae Mi-jun seems like he wants to ask but never does to the end. Does he think ahead by himself that it might be rude?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know what Gyeon Gang-hyeon was doing since it’s not in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The possessing me in my previous life…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I say I can’t remember, Sa Ye-ho will look at me strangely.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just lived, you know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Then you were unemployed? Will you appear on my broadcast when you retire?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly overwhelmed by sleepiness, I rustled the blanket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Don’t sleep! Don’t sleep don’t sleep don’t sleep don’t sleep ugh shit what’s with that sniper!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was so loud gaming that I couldn’t really fall asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Right, hey, is your body okay when you train?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. I haven’t coughed up blood since then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Fuck, the Busan Gate backstab was insane. When they said the reserve team of 2 was released and I was rushing out frantically, my deployment rights were stolen right before my eyes. Fucking highway robber bastard! Made me like a dog chasing chickens… no, a snake chasing dogs? But ah, it’s funny again. Hehehe Ha-ri treating you like a fucking princess…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s being serious, getting annoyed, rolling around laughing, but anyway—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho surprisingly treats me as a human being. Though he’s far from being as extreme as someone like Ja Hyeong-woo, he still shows human concern.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Plus there are unexpectedly beneficial advantages he brings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Sae-geon hyung will probably send you if another D-grade gate appears.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had already started another game. Though sleepy, I was planning to play the mystery game Sa Ye-ho was doing together for just 20 minutes, putting our heads together across the screen when Sa Ye-ho suddenly said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it’s a D-grade gate, additional training?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yeah, just you.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about Hae Mi-jun and Won Ha-ri?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“After seeing the accident when he sent you and Won Ha-ri together last time, he says it’s hopeless to send two or more newcomers together.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being with Sa Ye-ho, Woo Sae-geon’s stories often flow in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was also good for judging how far the original flow had progressed. I had caught an important information line. Woo Sae-geon is the leader with final decision-making power, and external incidents reach him first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho knew Woo Sae-geon’s situation to an amazing degree. What that gentleman is currently busy with, how much he’s agonizing over Twelve Zodiac management. The consistent mindset that he regards us underlings as kindergarteners…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s no way Woo Sae-geon would directly spill such things, so how does this guy know everything?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At minimum, Woo Sae-geon allowed Sa Ye-ho to fidget around nearby.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does that make sense? He’s exactly the type Woo Sae-geon would hate most. Noisy and distracting.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, there didn’t seem to be any particular mention of Sa Ye-ho being close to Woo Sae-geon. Was it skipped because it wasn’t Ja Hyeong-woo’s business?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, Sa Ye-ho is a double-edged sword. The fact that I’m hearing Woo Sae-geon’s news like this means, conversely, my stories also get carried to Woo Sae-geon through Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly a notification appeared in the status window.
