<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monumental moment when the Dog successor first entered the successor gym.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, the facilities are fucking good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it wasn’t much different from the regular gym, it somehow felt luxurious because it was so clean and had fewer people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At most there are 10 people here. Space-wise, it looks like 30 people could fit.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But such is the way of life. No place is perfect. If the facilities are good, the people are bound to be shit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The kids at my old place were middle schoolers, so their weights were relatively manageable, but the guys here will be different.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before entering, I imagined the near future that would befall me. Muscular gym bros like wild beasts (like Ja Hyeong-woo) handling iron bars heavier than my body weight like tin cans (like Woo Sae-geon), stripping off their shirts to intimidate newbies (like Yang Pyo) while sending pitying looks and mocking my frail arms (like Ma Cheon-ah).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Welcome!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun popped up from between the exercise equipment. He greeted me with a smile brighter than capitalism’s service industry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does Gang-hyeon hyung always come out at this time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Probably? I’d be later if anything, not earlier. I’m still sleepy now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside the gym, there were only about half the total, so roughly five successors scattered around. I roughly looked at their faces and plopped down on a familiar piece of equipment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun naturally sat on the exercise equipment next to me. Sitting without asking if it was okay – this guy has changed too. Hae Mi-jun kept looking at me and grinning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you draw out your earth attribute?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Not yet. Doing it now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether successors or regular hunters, whether talented or delinquents. The start of all training was drawing up attribute energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Drawing out attribute affinity is usually done in quiet places.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a genius at attribute affinity so I’m not constrained by location, and above all, there’s a crucial reason I didn’t raise my attributes beforehand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To mentally prepare myself before grabbing the bar…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But something that takes even successors like Jin Seol-woon about 10 minutes on average, I can do in 1 minute, so it didn’t mean much. It should take longer. I’m not ready to throw myself into cruel fitness yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, I saw Sheep successor’s towering head. Yang Pyo bent down under the exercise equipment bar and came this way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello, Pyo hyung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh, hello.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the first time I’d seen Hae Mi-jun with a successor other than Ja Hyeong-woo. The two exchanged a decent morning greeting with just the right amount of goodwill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially Hae Mi-jun’s face when looking at Yang Pyo… how should I put it, he looked exactly like an ordinary male high school student, which surprised me. The first time I’d seen such an utterly bland face from him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he doesn’t brighten up for everyone older than him?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How much weight do you lift?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo hung his large frame on the exercise equipment and looked down arrogantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not to be outdone, I twisted my lips in a smile and boldly pointed to a barbell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  10 kilos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo suddenly lost interest and slumped away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is weight I raised through blood, sweat and tears though.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh… well. Fighting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I guess he was at a loss for words because someone with pitiful strength was being confident too. To use an analogy, an adult can’t pick a fight with a child.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I dragged out drawing attribute affinity to delay, but eventually that time came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unable to sigh in front of Hae Mi-jun, I only let out an internal groan and gripped the iron bar tightly with both hands. The rubber part stabbed painfully into my palm flesh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huu…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I’d tied up my hair, the back of my neck quickly grew hot. By the time I changed weight exercises, the back of my neck was already moist. My face was also hot from straining so much while struggling with the weight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Above all, the most bothersome thing was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Where did gym etiquette go?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The aggro drawn by a first-time entrant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone kept glancing at me. Especially Jin Seol-woon. Somewhat troubled-looking, but he didn’t turn away and kept observing. Without doing his own workout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at me like a zoo monkey, no, a dog. Is it funny that I’m fighting so desperately like this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The disgustingly good-looking Ja Hyeong-woo, whose well-developed shoulders and chest muscles were prominent even through his t-shirt, strode over and occupied my field of vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t train here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This bastard. Who are you to say that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One thing Ja Hyeong-woo’s bitchy comment just helped me with. My anger gauge rose so I could lift the weight one more time. Ngh, I strained with all my might, lifted it trembling, then put it down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Heu, heu…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I caught my breath and looked at Ja Hyeong-woo, his gaze wavered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you keep doing it like this at the water attribute gym too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What do you mean ‘like this’? Is there some other way to do it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kids’ education… Ja Hyeong-woo muttered quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when our eyes met again, he turned away as if the rest wasn’t worth saying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is not having much on my body worth bringing up kids’ education? They’d just think ‘I guess there are people like this too, I shouldn’t grow up like that.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I guess I’ve become someone the original protagonist picks fights with now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo tried to ignore me and focus on his own workout, but every so often he’d turn his gaze to me. Then suddenly, he’d briefly go outside the gym and come back in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Distractedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Haa, heu, haa…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The rest between sets was precious. As I tilted my head back and exhaled, I made eye contact with Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s face, who had been next to me, was completely red, whether from exercise. He covered his mouth then finally stood up abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll come back later!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even you’re running away, Hae Mi-jun?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Monkey successor Won Ha-ri was horrified at my exhausted state. She clung to my side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It looks too heavy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m making sure not to damage my muscles. The weight is right, it’s just that my stamina is shit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then rest while you do it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s better to take the beating first. No, is this expression right? It’s better to finish quickly at once…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put all my hopes into the next words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to build muscle…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri wiped my face with a towel while looking at me pitifully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It looks wrong to me, can’t you give up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You just crushed my hopes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui looked at me like I was impure and left long ago. Yang Pyo stood behind with an enlightened expression, watching my state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, wearing functional workout clothes that showed her abs, stood next to Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang oppa, didn’t you used to train with that dog over there?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We were just in the same space.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway. Was he always like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You must have gotten quite an eyeful.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t think about anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your expression is weird though, oppa?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gym hazing is really too severe. This should also be made public to the media.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Or maybe, is there really something strange about my face when I exercise? The reactions seem a bit different for it to be because I look too pathetic?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As lunchtime approached, I was able to meet the last two successors I hadn’t encountered yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These two seemed to have come to monitor me once, even though it wasn’t their exercise time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho appeared first, in flowing straight hanbok attire with no plans to exercise at all. He made a hmm sound then looked me up and down with a strange expression as if appreciating me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘See, something is strange. If I really looked funny, Sa Ye-ho would have burst out laughing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With a slight time difference, even Woo Sae-geon came. The gentle scholar looked at me lying down…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it my imagination, or did his gaze become slightly languid? A different reaction from usual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t understand the reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey Sa Ye-ho, tell me why everyone’s staring.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My voice echoed through the gym. Then everyone flinched as if startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except Sa Ye-ho and Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho burst into a short laugh. Finally the face I’d expected came out, a giggling expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t know? This is driving me crazy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What is it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you exercise, your face looks fucking— mmph!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Midway, Woo Sae-geon covered Sa Ye-ho’s mouth. He dragged him out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fucking… what was the rest? I couldn’t hear because of Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fucking… weak and pathetic?!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted loudly but there was no answer from the corridor. They must have been dragged far away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These damn bastards. Do you think I’ll cower and avoid crowded times? I’ll deliberately come more during busy hours.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, morning training was over, so I should eat lunch and take a nap. I shuffled out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But someone followed me. It was Jin Seol-woon. He stretched out his well-proportioned legs and instantly blocked the front of the corridor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you think about making a separate training room at home? Like me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even this bastard is doing this. I snapped irritably.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No points.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon didn’t give in and pushed his stubbornness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then exercise somewhere else or at a different time. When no one’s around.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does my presence lower your motivation that much? Because I’m lifting that measly weight? Is it shameful for a successor?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo said something similar earlier about kids’ education. Was this what he wanted to say?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s lips twitched once then stopped. He seemed to want to point out something, but then just closed his mouth and let out a light snort.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you mocking me, bastard?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s just laughter.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But certainly, Jin Seol-woon laughing when it’s not a broadcast is rare.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the laughter not fading, Jin Seol-woon suddenly had a sharp glint in his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, you’re right. Everyone seems to lose motivation when Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi is there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that was it after all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I think I could exercise even if Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi lowered my motivation. Want to do it with just the two of us every night?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stood behind the corner leading to the bathroom, spying on Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Jin Seol-woon facing each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He heard clearly the content of Jin Seol-woon’s secretly delivered proposal. Ja Hyeong-woo clenched his fist. The wall pressed by his fist shook slightly.
 </span>
