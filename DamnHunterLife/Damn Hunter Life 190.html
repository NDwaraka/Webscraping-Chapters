  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 190
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Above our heads, pressed tightly together as if sharing a long-awaited reunion, came the notification that the stage had been cleared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Let’s go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I went first and Ja Hyeong-woo followed. I tried to slip my hand free from his grip, but Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand clamped down on me like shackles, making every attempt fail.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Please let go once we get to the entrance……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I absolutely refused to have two men publicly appear holding hands tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as we exited the black entrance, efficiently collected magic stones from the bamboo leaf soldier corpses, and were about to head to the final exit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I could perceive was being dragged in the opposite direction from Ja Hyeong-woo, as if being sucked into a black hole. The arm Ja Hyeong-woo had urgently grabbed also fell away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was sitting forlornly in the middle of a gray road.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Screech! A car stopped in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The situation was so absurd that I couldn’t even think to dodge. If the driver hadn’t hit the brakes, there would have been a major accident. As an awakened hunter, I probably couldn’t even withstand being lightly hit by a car.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey! Are you drunk? Sitting on the road like that…… Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The young driver who angrily got out of his car after opening the door changed his expression when he saw my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did I barely manage to say I was sorry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to get up hesitantly and move to the sidewalk, but my knees kept buckling. The cold belatedly penetrated my body. My body trembled violently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was definitely our country, South Korea. Being placed alone in such a shabby state at a completely unexpected moment in an unexpected form, I felt the anxiety of being on another planet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely managed to sit on a bench with my shaking legs. I had no strength to keep standing. The ice-cold wooden bench stung my buttocks sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even then, passersby kept stopping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What the…… Is that really……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s Gyeon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Young people seemed to recognize me and gathered around me in a circle with surprised eyes. Then people of other age groups also stopped, wondering what this was about. My surroundings soon became chaotic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there a gate here by any chance……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No evacuation alert went off……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some people, thinking of the rule that monsters appear when successors show up, looked around fearfully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And most of them asked if I was okay. Powerless ordinary people, asking Korea’s 2nd-ranked hunter who had just finished dealing with Stage 11’s monster army.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about the stage? Has it been resolved?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Um, aren’t you Korea’s number 1 now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……I’m number 1? Not Ja Hyeong-woo? What are they talking about?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, they all recognize me. I’m already conspicuous wearing sobok alone among modern people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m the successor leader, so shouldn’t I be standing confidently……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But February’s cold didn’t make things easy for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is it so cold? The sobok definitely has warming functions, doesn’t it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He looks cold.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He really looks cold.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A group of female students in school uniforms whispered quietly, then took out colorful fur blankets from their bags. They even had the courage to break through the circular space formed around me and place them over me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Starting with that, hot packs began appearing one by one from people’s pockets, placed with gentle taps. It was warm, but…… embarrassing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The murmuring grew louder. There were people persistently trying to get answers by asking me questions, and others checking their phones as if urgently checking the news.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was so overwhelmed that I unconsciously spoke up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait, please be quiet for a moment……! And the cameras too……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few people flinched and turned off their phone cameras. But a few seconds later, they hid behind others and stealthily raised their lenses again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Regardless, I fell back into worry. The problem was serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window wouldn’t open. The inventory wouldn’t open either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there was one thing that uniquely survived from what was in my inventory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I held my phone, it vibrated. Not just me, but the people nearby were startled too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I answered the call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon, where are you?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing Ja Hyeong-woo’s voice, my violently beating heart gradually calmed down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was also in a panic like a lost person. He probably called because the status window communication wasn’t working.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to calmly explain this situation to Ja Hyeong-woo, who had panicked after I disappeared before his eyes. Though I was the most flustered one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, I…… seems like I got ejected?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After waiting a bit longer there, the Hunter Association sent a vehicle to pick me up after receiving contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sleekly designed limousine stopped in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People scattered in a rush. I too was wide-eyed seeing the car.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A familiar face got out of the car. It was Manager Park Yoon-seok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-nim, I’ll escort you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been flustered around me for a while after causing trouble recently, but now he was looking at me with unreadable eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t say anything in response.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside the smoothly driving vehicle, I clutched my phone and stared straight ahead silently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wanted to continue the call, but I hung up after threatening him with “If you don’t sleep, I won’t let it slide.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was separate from my feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat upright with bloodshot eyes, in a physical state where I felt like I’d collapse any moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was afraid of the darkness that would come if I closed my eyes. I worried that when I woke up again, something else might change without my knowledge, that I might suddenly forget this confused feeling. All sorts of worries and imaginings tormented me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Park Yoon-seok called me from beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Everything will be okay. You’ve worked so hard until now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it wasn’t much of a statement, hearing that voice slowly drained the strength from the corners of my eyes. My eyes gradually closed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I woke up, I was in some quiet, clean hospital room. A spray humidifier was shooting out steam.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was receiving IV nutrition in my arm, and Manager Park Yoon-seok was still by my side. As soon as our eyes met, he bowed his head to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry for bringing you to a place like this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like he was saying this thinking I’d hate hospitals.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stared at the IV needle stuck in my arm without much feeling. I felt no emotion. It was unfamiliar and strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if I had no experience of being hospitalized at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as Park Yoon-seok was about to say something more, vibrating came from the table. It seemed to be my phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a call from Ja Hyeong-woo-nim. Will you take it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh…… yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll give you water first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During the short time I drank water, Park Yoon-seok briefly explained the situation so far.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said I had undergone detailed examination at the hospital right after coming out of the stage, and fortunately no abnormalities were found, but I had slept for a full two days after that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The vibrating continued, but I ignored it for a moment. Then I took time to shudder at Ja Hyeong-woo’s sixth sense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How does he know to call right when I wake up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok answered my muttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo-nim asked us to connect a cam. He’s been watching over you the entire time you were sleeping.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I learned the truth, I lightly shuddered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What a creepy bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How am I going to live with this guy from now on?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I flinched, remembering Park Yoon-seok’s gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Oh, did I just curse out loud?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I awkwardly averted my eyes, but Park Yoon-seok wasn’t displeased that a young guy had cursed – instead he seemed to find even that endearing and was smiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Apparently, as soon as all the successors received news that Stage 11 had been cleared and that I had been safely ejected alone outside the school, they all collapsed without exception.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And it seems I was the last to wake up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The space had split too suddenly. Instead of embracing each other and sharing the joy of clearing it, we could only talk through phone calls as our only means. I didn’t know, but apparently the kids even fought over who would call me first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even during the chaotic barrage of phone calls, I absorbed the information I had missed while sleeping one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, one shocking event.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stages were over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, even though the stages disappeared, gates still existed in the world as before. But now Korea’s successors no longer had to fight for the survival of the world and hunters. The burden carried by the successors had become much lighter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The most likely trigger for this was that I had completely closed the door of the stage – what I called the gate within the gate – and returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t know it at the time, but in closing that door, I apparently lost all my power as the price. And I was suddenly expelled from Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was still a whole year left until I turned 24. It was an exceptionally early retirement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, when I retired, all the rules I had re-established at Hunter School reverted back to their original state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What this meant was that all hunters took one vacation and were then confined back to Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, didn’t I make an emergency escape because I was afraid you guys would kill me if I didn’t summon you back when I returned? Anyway, it’s your fault.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the situation had become like this, the leadership vacancy had to be filled urgently. I transferred all authority to Sa Ye-ho. Sa Ye-ho cursed up a storm asking if he’d ever seen such a fucking deserter, but I calmly fought back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I’d gathered most of the information, but there was one last remaining question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The identity of the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I ultimately couldn’t hear about it, I decided to give it the most plausible name based on my experiences so far.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Jade Emperor, something like that. The Jade Emperor appeared in the twelve zodiac folktales from the beginning, didn’t he?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, though I retired a year earlier than expected, I didn’t have many complaints. Thanks to my performance as leader, I received payment from the association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To think I came all this way to get that damn hunter retirement compensation……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I naturally found myself looking back on the past. Reflecting on the strange path I’d traveled gave me new feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And an equally unstable thought hung on me like a weight, making me sink.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that I was originally the owner of this body is still overwhelming. Even now, I sometimes think this might be a show Ja Hyeong-woo is putting on to deceive me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Consider that the days I believed I had acted according to my own will and thoughts were actually the result of Cheon Gang-hyeon’s inner self being reflected throughout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Never mind. I don’t need to rush to accept it. I have plenty of time to think slowly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And that guy won’t leave me either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t accept the fact that he had been separated from me in a long-distance relationship…… no, not even a relationship but a parting of the living. He clung to my screen, begging me not to hang up the video call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So while I stayed temporarily in the association’s guest room, my only obligation was to be with Ja Hyeong-woo remotely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m getting an officetel contract. Not me, but Manager Park Yoon-seok.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Ja Hyeong-woo in the screen suddenly asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“How many rooms does that house have?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Three, I think.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Really? It would be nice if there was just one. Too bad.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is he interfering with the number of rooms in my house? And why does he want to reduce them instead of increase them?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even if there are multiple rooms, you’ll let us share the same bedroom, right?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suddenly had an ominous feeling. When I stared at him with a face that didn’t understand, Ja Hyeong-woo gave a subtle explanation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You said you wanted to live together.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing those words, I remembered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to be with you. Forever from now on.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My spine went cold. A dismayed feeling crashed over my brain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not what I meant……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it wasn’t hot, it felt like sweat was pouring down the back of my neck. Regardless of my expression, Ja Hyeong-woo began muttering as if lost in his own world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“One year is too long.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, did you hear what I said?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“But if I endure that period, I’ll never be separated from you forever, so I’ll try to bear it.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, you crazy bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m already excited. Living together with you has been my lifelong dream. I’m such a happy person. Though I’ll be unhappy for one year.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was obvious that Ja Hyeong-woo was deliberately ignoring my words and playing dumb. Laughter was mixed in his voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt like I had fallen into a tremendous swamp. One I could never escape from, and probably wouldn’t try to escape from either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And this would definitely not be a mistake.
 </span>
