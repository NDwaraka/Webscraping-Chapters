  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 137
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the training came to an end, the video length also reached its end. It was exactly the 20 minutes Gyeon Gang-hyeon had suggested.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even considering that the successors moved quickly because they were afraid he might cough up blood, the growth between the start and end of training was as excellent as the previous leader. The Gyeon Gang-hyeon in the video was sufficient to convince anyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as Ja Hyeong-woo had said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as he declared break time, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s expression relaxed as if by magic. He returned to his usual face and made a commotion, patting Yang Pyo’s shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright, alright. This is much better than yesterday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How serious was it yesterday…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It was pretty bad. To the point where I wondered if things were really difficult lately?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader looks the most exhausted though.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah, I’m exhausted. Someone hug me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had set the mood, looked to the side, Hae Mi-jun, who followed him around like a tail these days, was right nearby. Hae Mi-jun shyly extended his arms slightly. Gyeon Gang-hyeon leaned against Hae Mi-jun and relaxed comfortably.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll tell you what I saw, so listen. Sa Ye-ho, you first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The new leader wasn’t particularly generous with praise either, but at least his feedback was gentler compared to the previous leader. And his ability to pinpoint detailed aspects was outstanding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He properly observed the movements that occurred when several people tangled simultaneously, and even caught new minor habits like which person looked where first in an instant. He suggested more efficient methods for using non-earth attribute skills as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the threat he always added at the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you don’t fix what I told you, you’re dead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m the one who’ll be dead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey hey, let’s do this properly. Every time you make a mistake, you’re taking 1 year off our leader’s lifespan.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The video ended with the successors laughing like any students as they left the training ground. They approached the camera by the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who was at the doorway, reached out his hand the moment Hae Mi-jun and Gyeon Gang-hyeon passed by. He tried to naturally steal and embrace Gyeon Gang-hyeon. His grip lightly embraced Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s back and pulled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The thin body didn’t follow and stayed in place. Not because of the person himself, but because the person holding him gripped tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Ja Hyeong-woo looked, Hae Mi-jun bowed his head deeply. As if avoiding his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who realized the situation a beat late, frowned slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing? Just come out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to being hidden by the wide white sleeves, Hae Mi-jun’s hands weren’t captured by the camera. Ja Hyeong-woo, who had nothing to argue back with, just followed out empty-handed as the scene ended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…It was filmed like this. Would you like me to edit it if you want?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some time later, Gyeon Gang-hyeon checked the latter part filmed at the end. Ja Hyeong-woo’s appearance that looked like he’d been rejected to anyone watching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  PD Hong Jeong-hyeok, while editing the video, contacted Gyeon Gang-hyeon directly saying he’d received it through Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For Gyeon Gang-hyeon, it was somewhat puzzling why he was asking him this specifically. Had Ja Hyeong-woo been filmed looking too pitiful? Or was he worried Gyeon Gang-hyeon would get cursed at by people?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But why is this person being nice to me? Because I’m the leader?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t need to cut it. Just leave it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s decision to leave that scene had two reasons. First, he wanted to deliberately show people himself responding curtly to reduce the rumors about him and Ja Hyeong-woo circulating in the community.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Second, he had the ulterior motive of inducing sympathetic public opinion for Ja Hyeong-woo, who would be slandered somewhere as a ‘homo’ due to those rumors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Sigh.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After glancing at the tanned face in the frozen screen, he quickly averted his eyes as if uncomfortable. He sighed ten times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon watched the uploaded training video to the end while checking the chat that had come up during the initial release.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Fuck now I feel sorry for him’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Just date already’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘At that level gender doesn’t seem to be the issue’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo is the type who’d say he’ll become a woman’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  ‘I never thought I’d think ㅈㅎㅇ isn’t disgusting and ㄱㄱㅎ seems fucking heartless’
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The chats were uncomfortable to look at. If he could, he’d want to delete them all. So neither he nor anyone else could see them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially so Gang-hyeon-ssi wouldn’t see them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he was at home, he looked into the air as if Ja Hyeong-woo was standing at a distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is that person’s feelings also growing bigger and bigger to the point they can’t be suppressed? Enough for an unspecified number of people to notice.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, that person never cared about others’ gazes from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘For me, it’s difficult to do that because I have a lot to lose.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Jin Seol-woon, who didn’t usually covet others’ things, realized an emotion strange even to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon has been good at taking the lead and guiding others since he was young.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to extract it from that person’s head and see it. Gang-hyeon-ssi’s past appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What kind of child was he? He must have had a triumphant face then too. He would have been a noisy child who drew attention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It wasn’t just me and Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi looking at him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While suffering from the sense of deprivation that he wished Ja Hyeong-woo’s memories were his, he suddenly recalled his own elementary school days. He’d never played with friends after school because he was busy going here and there to vocal academy, dance academy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking like that, even if he had the past he desired, it seemed like he wouldn’t have had time to hang out and play with little Gyeon Gang-hyeon anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What if I’d suggested we become idols together?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had been having even ridiculous fantasies, soon put away his delusions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He tried to hope, almost like avoidance, that Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi didn’t like Gang-hyeon-ssi in that way…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But watching from right beside them, there was no way not to know. The only one who didn’t know might be Gang-hyeon-ssi alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But lately, hadn’t those two rarely raised their voices in front of others?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Ja Hyeong-woo’s phantom glanced back at Jin Seol-woon himself. Their eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like it often happened during training with Gyeon Gang-hyeon between them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had been certain at some point. That Ja Hyeong-woo was also conscious of him, and that his actions had the intention to keep him in check.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If both Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi and I are equal in front of Gang-hyeon-ssi.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He estimated how many times he’d had his back to Ja Hyeong-woo in battles so far. Himself as a sub-tanker who had once assisted the healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if it might seem petty, he no longer wanted to help Ja Hyeong-woo from behind. He wanted to stand in front and catch Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…As Gang-hyeon-ssi said, I should become an offensive tanker, not a support type.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  [Hunter Association Official] Successor Leader Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s First Stage Clear Roster Announcement After Election

</p>

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There have been major changes among the successors recently. Nevertheless, we have united once again around Korea’s new #1 and our leader who is also #2. Additionally, through consistent training, we announce that the metal attribute successor has finally completed her preparations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  We will always strive to repay the concern and support you send us. Thank you.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The announcement, which clearly showed it was written by Gyeon Gang-hyeon himself, revealed his confidence that he would fill the previous leader’s void and successfully clear future stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was unique about this clear attempt was that each successor wasn’t specifically assigned directions. The new leader had boldly removed the four directions entirely from the clear team. He added that, as recent stage difficulty had increased, he declared flexible changes through the leader’s orders regarding that aspect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if hinting that writing in directions matching the five elements was merely to provide elements people could relate to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While entering the stage entrance with Gyeon Gang-hyeon as the leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whispers not caught by cameras leaked between the successors. It was the voices of Sa Ye-ho and Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why don’t we get more other successors? General awakeners keep appearing. Where did the tiger and rooster go?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since the former leader left, I feel like one will be filled soon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I hope the tiger comes out. If it’s third among the twelve zodiac, it would theoretically be the strongest dealer. Ja Hyeong-woo is a healer, and Sae-geon hyung isn’t here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Chatter that was never allowed when Yoon Sae-geon was leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, no anxious feelings seeped into their expressions and voices. Despite currently discussing personnel shortages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the very atmosphere that the one who had called himself a delinquent until now had planted in the current Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been walking behind listening, finally made a snickering sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The listening monkey and dog are embarrassed. Don’t you know your leader is second from the back in the twelve zodiac?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before stepping foot in the entrance, Won Ha-ri looked up at Gyeon Gang-hyeon with a face that still showed her youth. Tension was evident on her face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s okay.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon whispered only with his mouth shape and smiled warmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m confident in you. Today is your stage.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon a mountain thick with trees, where neither bottom nor top could be seen, spread before them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since trees covered the black sky, a desolate darkness naturally settled on the ground. It was exactly like the old tale of ‘climbing a mountain at night and meeting a tiger.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as the sound of rustling leaves eerily scratched their eardrums, the growling sound of beasts rang quite close.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But their view was still shrouded in darkness where nothing could be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow shit… It’s just a quantity offensive.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grumbled lowly. Won Ha-ri grabbed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s sleeve and trembled slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before they knew it, between the dense tree trunks, tigers’ yellow eyes were everywhere. The tigers surrounded them as they watched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon calmly began the strategy.
 </span>
