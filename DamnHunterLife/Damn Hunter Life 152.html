  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 152
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the middle of the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I’m not in a situation to worry about such things. My goal is to somehow stay alive by treating it temporarily, even if it’s just a stopgap measure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo just stared at me blankly like someone who’d been hit. It was irritating. I gritted my teeth and snapped at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I said there’s no time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if you don’t rush me like that…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What am I even doing?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to glare at him, Ja Hyeong-woo strode closer. His pupils had turned pitch black again, gone crazy at some point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you getting excited about that again?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is the bright outdoors that appealing to you… I was about to say, when hot warmth covered my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body shuddered at the sudden heat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo immediately pulled his lips away, as if remembering something he’d forgotten.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your face turns red when you kiss and it doesn’t go away. Can you hide it from other people without them noticing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shit… Then you won’t treat me? You want me to die?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t show that to other people. You don’t know how lewd you look.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So what are you going to do about it? Do you want to die?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo completely lifted his head and even bit the chest that had been pressed against him. Then he stepped back and covered somewhere on his body with his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jerk me off.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I saw what he was boldly pointing to, there was definitely a *clang* sound in my head. Right now, telling me to, in broad daylight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You want me to touch it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought I’d been doing pretty well blocking Ja Hyeong-woo’s dirty intentions until now. I was completely wrong. I can’t handle this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t have an ounce of shame. He was so serious that I wondered if I was the strange one. He savored my shock with his eyes, taking it all in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since you won’t be getting aroused directly, we won’t get caught. The conditions aren’t ideal, but I’ll do my best to get hard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Insects chirped *chirp chirp* here and there in the forest. The wind blew endlessly, making the leaves flutter and rustle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing what might jump out, not knowing when other students might suddenly appear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This wasn’t the place for Ja Hyeong-woo to pull down his waistband and reveal the grotesque flesh rod hidden inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was too late to stop him. It was already exposed before my eyes. The moment I saw it, I recoiled at its intimidating size.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How does he carry around something like that? Shouldn’t he be quarantined from school?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d only encountered it indirectly before – this was the first time seeing it with my eyes. This bastard had been living his life carrying around something like my forearm. And this was even its docile size before getting hard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The vicious cock that my gaze touched definitely trembled slightly. Blood rushed to the area below the large glans. The shaft quivered finely as it swelled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The guy’s hand supporting the base twitched. Only now did Ja Hyeong-woo’s earlobes turn slightly red too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said there’s no time. Hurry…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who’s the one rushing now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt like I’d been scammed. With the feeling of crawling into a swamp with my own feet, I hesitantly approached. Reluctantly, I examined that thing more closely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked impatient, like he might grab my wrist at any moment. Before he could, I touched the middle section first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ngh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it was because my hand was cold or even that was stimulation, Ja Hyeong-woo moaned lowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The skin touching my hand was too hot. Heat rose all the way to the top of my head too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing what to do, I gently squeezed it for now. After delicately caressing between the shaft and head with my fingernail, I got embarrassed by my own curiosity and just moved up and down moderately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t go down toward the root connecting the groin and base. I was afraid the coarse pubic hair might touch my hand. Just thinking about it felt uncomfortable and embarrassing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Touch it a bit harder. Ugh… wait a moment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Ja Hyeong-woo wrapped my hand with his. Pushed by that force, my palm gripped his cock tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then slightly darker-colored liquid leaked from the tip of his glans. My grip quickly became slippery and wet. White hand and dark red cock glistened together as they slid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, this is driving me crazy.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m flustered and it’s so obscene I can’t think of anything. The visual stimulation is too intense, somehow making my head grow more and more dazed. I feel like I’m becoming stupid along with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Rustle—*
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the grass at the cave entrance swayed. I was greatly startled and tried to shake off what I was holding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But my hand remained right where it was. In the end, Ja Hyeong-woo, who had crossed the line, gripped my hand and began moving it forcefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My hand moved frantically. Sweeping all the way down to the root, gripping and releasing while rubbing vigorously. The blood vessels protruding from his cock left red marks on my hand. A mixture of tension, mild discomfort, and shame made me tingle too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo let out a low throat sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crazy perverted bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His cock continued swelling to a disgusting degree. Moreover, it became hard enough to hurt my hand. Before I knew it, it was standing pressed against his stomach. Why was there so much pre-cum? It flowed over even onto the back of my hand, dripping to the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of the angle of his cock, I kept making eye contact with the small hole where liquid was trickling out. Even when I tried to look away—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you keep watching? Then I get harder.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo noticed like a ghost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Most unbearable of all was Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze that I could feel even without looking. His burning eyes looking down at both the hand stroking his cock up and down and my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But having seen this much, the idea of stopping here didn’t occur to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because the healer bastard who I could never match in strength even if I devoted my whole life to it was losing his mind over my one awkward hand movement – that was actually quite appealing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My eyes were already ruined too, and thinking I needed to receive maximum yang energy supply, I was also putting my whole heart into it…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, Ja Hyeong-woo released the pressure from the hand gripping mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re hard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stopped the hand I’d been shaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I recognized it, I felt an ache from below. My breathing was also rougher than before. As if an earthquake had occurred in my head, all my thoughts stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t like I was being done to, but the fact that I got hard from touching someone else’s thing just wouldn’t compute in my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Try to hold it in. You can’t get hard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that something you should be saying?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even then, after you came your strength completely drained out. There’s still more to clear.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut up. Don’t act like you know!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gritting my teeth, with my hand still gripped on Ja Hyeong-woo’s cock, I wiggled my body awkwardly. To hide the bulge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching me disgracefully twist my waist, Ja Hyeong-woo removed his hand and pressed his body close to mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s just request additional support.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? Huk, hey…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thick arms lifted me up and set me down on the soft earth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The durumagi on my shoulders naturally became a blanket. Ja Hyeong-woo untied the knot at my collarbone and spread the durumagi completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll help you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His fingers rubbed the front of my pants in circles. The gentle touch was ticklish, making me tremble. I could only shout frantically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cut it out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, think about it. Can you really hide this from other people without them noticing? Really?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo brought his face close and spoke calmly. His eyes were smiling. My face reflected in his black pupils flinched at those words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll touch my own cock now too. If you stay still, I’ll do everything for you. Okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His seductive whisper was gentle. The soft voice rolled in my ear like unhealthy candy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, my pants slid down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the position of looking up at the damp cave ceiling, my thing saw the outside air. It felt like Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes were observing my exposed thighs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We were both hanging out our cocks, but only I felt a surge of embarrassment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…But what does he mean by doing both himself? Does he mean to grab one with each hand?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was swallowing my confusion, Ja Hyeong-woo crawled on top of me. Supporting the ground with one arm, he leaned his body over mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My curiosity was greater than the aversion from the position. This way only one hand is free? What is he going to do with one hand—?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My slightly erect pale cock and Ja Hyeong-woo’s dark-colored cock showing a stark contrast. Only when his embarrassingly large cock came close enough to almost touch mine did I realize something was strange, and by then it was too late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like my cock caught fire. Blazing pleasure exploded from below. My vision went white.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After barely grasping the one thread of consciousness remaining after a few seconds, I could make out that Ja Hyeong-woo was gripping both cocks together and shaking them with strong friction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh, hnngh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time I tried to sit up, I collapsed back to the ground. I felt like I’d become a complete flame. My whole body felt like it was bouncing around. The feeling of climax built up too rapidly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Ja Hyeong-woo’s large palm seemed to struggle with both, as he occasionally lost his grip. But even that was stimulation. The sensation of bouncing and being caught again made my body tense up more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On top of that, his hard, hot shaft kept rubbing against mine as it was squeezed in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand. The protruding veins scraping the surface also made my senses too sensitive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I lost control of my body from the blazing heat. Thanks to that, my tensed lower abdomen kept spurting pre-cum as it gathered. Liquid that I couldn’t tell was mine or Ja Hyeong-woo’s soaked both cocks, making slippery squelching sounds as it slid. My legs and waist couldn’t stay still and kept moving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you whimpering so much? Is it hard?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My scattered mind returned a little at the whispered voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who else but a puppy would do that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard. Before I could get angry, I was swept away by pleasure again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, huk…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rough moans and breathing mixed chaotically. My writhing and Ja Hyeong-woo’s hip thrusts were often out of sync. Each time, irregular stimulation struck my whole body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Through all that, I thought I vaguely heard a strange sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I clenched my fists tight. Only after my nails dug into my palms did my senses barely return. I focused on the sound ringing in my ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon. Gang-hyeon? Is something wrong? Answer me.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was someone else’s voice.
 </span>
