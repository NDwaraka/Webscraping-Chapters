 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successor communication is a contact method provided by the status window. There’s text chatting and voice calls, with chat having no member limit and calls allowing up to 5 people simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Theoretically it can be used anywhere without particular restrictions. It works even inside gates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The fact that they haven’t invited me despite being a successor means one of two things.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Either they don’t acknowledge me as a successor. Or they thought communication wasn’t necessary since I don’t participate in conquests.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now, I belonged to both categories.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Currently, an invitation notification is blinking before my eyes. Now they can’t exclude me since the Busan gate incident is firmly standing there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s been so long since I awakened. Did they invite Won Ha-ri first and watch me for a while?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a reasonable suspicion, but looking at the chat room, Won Ha-ri had just been invited too. Won Ha-ri’s inviter was Ma Cheon-ah, and the person who invited me was Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>

</p>

  Clearly there are 10 kids gathered who are an average age of 20.2, at the perfect age for spouting nonsense, but the chat room is complete silence itself.

  Even Hae Mi-jun, who would normally attach at least 10 exclamation marks at times like this, timidly added just one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That made sense since this place was nothing more than a solemn announcement room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s what happens where Woo Sae-geon is.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s used as a communication network during stage conquests, plus you can’t arbitrarily change those stiff successor nicknames, it hardened into an official room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho could chatter away single-handedly, but even that guy somehow hides his true self and keeps his mouth shut in this atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wondered why he invited me, then as soon as I entered, one of Woo Sae-geon’s announcements came up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy would never do one-on-one chatting or anything like that.

  Ja Hyeong-woo again… Right, a healer is essential so it can’t be helped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt like it would be better to take Hae Mi-jun along, but Hae Mi-jun doesn’t have that kind of experience yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And Yang Pyo and Ma Cheon-ah.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both are Twelve Zodiac members I’ve never had a conversation with yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m more concerned about Yang Pyo among them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He said he’d leave Won Ha-ri out and send only me, but turns out he was planning to include Yang Pyo?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo was also treated almost like a newcomer at this point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the four earth attribute users, I stood out so much that he was relatively overshadowed, but aside from me, there’s another guy who can’t pull his weight.

  After Ma Cheon-ah’s chat, nothing came up for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even people unrelated to the practice checked the chat, so the number of unread people next to messages quickly decreased, but it stopped at 1.

  The last guy on the roster was silent.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Keke.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is this funny? The chat room with only Woo Sae-geon’s echoes is hilarious. For the first time, I liked what Ja Hyeong-woo was doing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No one can deliver business to Ja Hyeong-woo via text. The only means of conveying something to Ja Hyeong-woo is phone calls.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo is a rare sight in this era, a 100% pure computer illiterate who hates looking at screens. I know he uses ‘audio listening’ even when checking skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s also because of his stubbornness to never look elsewhere during training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that others have been dying of frustration from him checking chats late for months means he has no intention of fixing it himself, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hahaha! Ha… I was laughing then suddenly felt cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wait, why does Ja Hyeong-woo read my texts right away?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the chat window moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The 1 that had been decorating the end of all chats disappeared with a whoosh. At the very end, one really unfamiliar chat was added.
 </span>

  Starting from Sa Ye-ho’s chat, unread numbers appeared again. They all scattered instantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, the D-rank gate second practice was confirmed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Above all, this time not being a first experience made me feel at ease. And crucially, there was no Won Ha-ri to break eggs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Yang Pyo is a bit worrying, but… the team is a truly standard tank-DPS-heal combination. With earth, fire, and water, the attribute boundary is wide too. Isn’t it actually too good for a D-rank gate?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m the only excess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that python gate, variables occurred so I had no choice but to overdo it, but this time will be different. I really just need to take care of my own survival.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t thinking much about it. At least until I looked at my original notes once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But one incident I had written on the ‘not serious stuff list’ suddenly caught my eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Huh, this incident doesn’t have much time left?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the Busan gate changing from June to April mixed everything up, ‘this’ is an incident where the date is hard to change.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not an urgent problem, but I thoughtfully propped my chin and drummed my fingers. I went into the status window to check my point balance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think I’ll be short on points. I need to score big somewhere.”

  There are so many things around me picking fights. I thought I’d just tamed Squeaky. The dog familiar… I somehow soothed the puppy who was shedding tears and snot, and carefully explained the reality that he had to share me with Squeaky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, the big score I was thinking of was selling monster corpses or gems from the D-rank gate to the shop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s the most reliable way to earn points. Except that conquest loot goes to leader Woo Sae-geon first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There are two options.
 </span>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Get it from that conservative bastard Woo Sae-geon through mutual irritation and hassle.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Embezzle it.
  </span>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I unnecessarily stretched while turning my neck. Like someone about to do something big.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I try some light embezzlement?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For that, I’d need the skill to easily handle at least C~B rank monsters… abilities aside, this normal bow won’t work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ultimately, the weapon that suits successors best is one they craft themselves…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time has come to step into the field I’ve been putting off. I’m already worried about how much stamina will be drained, but I can’t depend on others’ weapons forever.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to be able to make weapons to create my general hunter force that doesn’t have a single person yet, and get external recognition to receive pensions too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Can I do it with my current physical condition?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, today is the morning after a self-imposed holiday. It was a day when my body was unusually fine. Plus I haven’t gone to training yet, so I have an advantage too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes, oppa?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri, I’m skipping training today too. Tell the instructor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next, I need a senior to help with weapon crafting. I have to choose from the same earth attribute, but the options are still narrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I don’t have a phone number, I use communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon. I want to try making an earth weapon, can you teach me the knack of making it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of an answer, rough breathing came through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He must have been training, as I heard a thunk… sound like iron bars being put down. Soon the breathing calmed and Jin Seol-woon spoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Are you some kind of natural disaster, Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi? No warning, just business out of nowhere?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, honestly I’m not quite a disaster. So will you help or not?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got a bit anxious at the longer silence than expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s not a difficult task, I thought he’d just do it, but do I need to offer something? What do I have to give Jin Seol-woon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Fine. But you have to come here.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the condition? Super cheap? Of course I’ll take it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes. Now is fine too.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I’ll teleport to you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Wait—”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I heard him trying to stop me belatedly, but the movement command had already gone through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said now was fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I grumbled face-to-face instead of through communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The place Jin Seol-woon was at was a personal gym inside his home. He, who had shouted “wait,” was hurriedly putting on a t-shirt. Well-defined abs disappeared under the clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who regained composure as if he’d never been flustered, gestured for me to sit on the bench.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you bring a weapon to use as a base?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put down the Korean bow I’d gotten familiar with through training together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can you include a rest and sight too when crafting? So they’re detachable later.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Probably possible. Let me look first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon picked it up like he was examining it and fiddled with the bowstring. While I sat on the bench watching, I heard Jin Seol-woon’s voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You won’t use the sword I gave you anymore?”
