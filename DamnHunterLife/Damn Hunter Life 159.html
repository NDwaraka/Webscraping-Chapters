  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 159
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tsk, Myo Cho-hui clicked her tongue lightly. Her burned fingers were blistered, so she couldn’t properly grip her spear with strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, thanks to Yang Pyo absorbing most of the heat…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sheep familiar’s majestic appearance grew faint. Yang Pyo, kneeling on the ground and gasping for breath, was already in tatters. His whole body was charred and his senses seemed dulled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, I, Ja Hyeong-woo, and Jin Seol-woon didn’t suffer serious injuries from the recent fire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo gritted his teeth and drew up as much cool water energy as possible. The exhausted-looking mouse familiar quickly circled around again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo somehow endured without drying up in the hot flames, but the other healer seemed unable to do the same.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah, huk.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun exhaled roughly. His pig familiar, whose body had almost completely evaporated, was reverse-summoned. The large water familiar disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huk…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hot wind that the pig had been blocking came rushing in strongly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors, helplessly pushed back by the hot heat, were crowded together tightly. Myo Cho-hui blocked in front of me and drew out plants to the maximum. She was trying to block the harmful smoke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely caught Hae Mi-jun as he collapsed. As a result, we both slumped down together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, his face all injured, looked up at me from my lap. Eyes that seemed about to cry turned toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry. I was lacking.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shook my head. I swept Hae Mi-jun’s bangs aside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ve always been too good for me. Your abilities and your heart.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know if I should feel desperate about this moment or not. I felt no emotion at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just had the thought that this eighteen-year-old boy in front of me no longer looked like a child. It was quite a strange feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gripped Hae Mi-jun’s hand tightly and forcibly stole his energy. I breathed in his unique energy deeply until my body was completely full.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun called out to me in surprise. I pretended not to hear, ignoring even Hae Mi-jun’s injured arm trying to stop me, and gathered the water energy I’d scraped from him inside my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was power I should conserve, but if I suffered injuries here that prevented me from getting back up, what came next would be meaningless. So I didn’t hesitate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The refreshing power of water poured over me endlessly like a waterfall. The force swept through me as if I’d forget what color I originally was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried not to lose consciousness. While doing so, I breathed deeply in and out to draw up the fundamental, warm attribute that lay beneath all attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it was negative energy harmful to me, perhaps because it was uniquely pure, I felt no pain at all in summoning this cardinal deity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The people around me turned toward me one by one. Surprised expressions arose here and there as they gradually realized what was happening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my eyes wide and glared at the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s create an ocean first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I used the life force Ja Hyeong-woo had given me without reserve to shape my energy. The abundant energy caused a massive storm inside. The moment the energy took form, I brought it outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dark blue light scattered in all directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though not as splendid and ever-changing as Suzaku, the most mysterious and profound legendary animal from myth rose up into the sky, extinguishing the fire energy like a candle flame.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <b>
  &lt;Northern Guardian Water Deity Xuanwu&gt;

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Origin: Water guarding the north fuses with earth that builds up from the center, manifesting a god from mythology.

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The turtle head and snake head each breathed out beautiful water energy. The acrid smoke had somehow turned into clear water mist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Raindrops began falling gently on our faces, opening our airways.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s entire body was clean as he stood up in bewilderment. The energy Xuanwu scattered changed the environment of the entire area and healed all our bodies.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting aside Ja Hyeong-woo looking at me as if I were a god… everyone gazed at me with wonder. Meanwhile, Ja Hyeong-woo worried about my body through chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got up hastily while helping Hae Mi-jun to his feet. Though I staggered slightly, I didn’t forget to stay alert to our surroundings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d consumed one cardinal deity. The cooldown for the cardinal deity I’d already used was still far off, and the metal attribute cardinal deity was incompatible with Won Ha-ri’s yin-yang, so it was excluded from the start.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I now had only one cardinal deity left that I could summon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I hope Xuanwu’s duration lasts as long as possible, so it can fight alongside us even after we find the boss.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This boss monster is a ghost that detection skills don’t work on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, at this point I held a strange certainty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since there was no other method anyway, considering that in the end I could only trust my instincts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The ghost will come looking for me, or become interested in me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boss would appear on its own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A being far more powerful and vicious than any fire demons we’d faced so far.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The black head emerging from the thick, hard shell made a sharp hissing sound and raised its head. The long tail swam nimbly in the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I watched to make sure Xuanwu didn’t disappear while frantically looking around to gauge which direction the boss was coming from.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is the boss coming? I can’t see it in any direction!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon shouted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone was only looking at me, but even I couldn’t find it. Sweat flowed again on my barely cooled head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The energy the boss monster was emitting was scattered throughout all directions. No matter which way I looked, I could sense its energy. In the ground, the sky, even in the terrible air flowing in and out of my lungs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I have to find it!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I shouted internally, a light shock occurred in my chest as if something had cracked and broken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An impossible field of vision opened up. There was ‘something’ in front of me. No one else seemed to know such a thing existed, but I could clearly sense it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A ghost, no… an existence even more unclear than a ghost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An opponent that couldn’t be seen, heard, or speak turned to look at me. The lips of that impossible existence opened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {When the next sun rises, your victory is assured.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I know what the boss is.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately, all attention focused on me. Everyone waited for what I would say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The boss might have been here from the beginning.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The temperature too high for fire demons to have created, the smell of something burning vibrating throughout all directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boss was this hellishly hot place itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And as soon as I grasped that fact, the heat surrounding us began getting uncontrollably hot as if launching a full-scale offensive. The feeling of all flesh cooking, even my eyes barely opening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Screams burst out from everywhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dozens of fireball meteors began falling toward our heads from the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Xuanwu vibrated painfully. Xuanwu extinguished the fireballs falling on us, but it had little effect. Even that cardinal deity couldn’t withstand this temperature that blocked our very breath regardless of range.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A dazed sense of despair emptied my insides completely black.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even though I summoned a cardinal deity… it’s not resolved.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Water kills fire, but if fire is too strong, it dries up the water. The strong fire ultimately pushed Ja Hyeong-woo back. The water flowing through Ja Hyeong-woo’s body dried up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I bit my lips hard to come to my senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You said to endure. Until dawn breaks the next day inside the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sky was entirely crimson. I don’t know what time it is now, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s only one method.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A thin S-grade sword was summoned from inventory. A sword of some earth attribute successor, with characteristics perfect for splitting the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The S-grade sword Jin Seol-woon had once given me, and even at this point absolutely refused to take back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Jin Seol-woon, I don’t have the right to do this after hurting you… but I’m borrowing it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, having exhausted all his water, approached as if dying out and wrapped his body around me. I burned up all the remaining life force inside me to bloom one skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Grave of the Dead (Earth Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kugugugung—! With a thunderous roar, the ground beneath us split open. Everyone was sucked inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ground my teeth tightly, gripped the sword with both hands, and drew it horizontally across to close the earth above our heads.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A skill name that always seemed ominous whenever I saw it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I would not make this place my team members’ grave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it had to become someone’s grave, the portion of just one person would be enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The greatly enlarged dog familiar supported the earth above me. The soil gradually covered the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I witnessed in the sky that was briefly visible at the end was a massive fireball pouring down onto the earth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump! Eventually the ground closed completely like a lid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something shattered to pieces in my head. That enormous fire was sucked entirely into my body as impact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The S-grade sword made a spine-chilling crack sound and broke in half in my hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a long time, something hot surged up from inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My mind, my body. Everything that made me up was turned upside down and torn apart. While helplessly watching the extreme pain swallow me, I somehow raised my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Where I turned my head as if drawn, there was one person. And one person was running toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two healers I held dear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were shouting something, but I couldn’t hear it because of the ringing in my ears. I’m sorry. I wanted to say it out loud but couldn’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of all people, you two had to see me again. I’m showing you once more the scene from your nightmares, aren’t I? What should I do?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I couldn’t think anymore. From now on, thinking wasn’t my right. The thoughts that had been connecting to my distant head were cut off abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The last thing I perceived was that blood poured out like a fountain from where I’d opened my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
