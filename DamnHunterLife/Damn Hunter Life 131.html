  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 131
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After laying Gyeon Gang-hyeon on the ground for treatment, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes shook as if they were splitting while examining him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The soft body that had collapsed obediently into his arms had a dislocated left arm and shoulder, plus torn clothes and bloodstains here and there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He must have internal injuries. Should I use intermediate healing… no, advanced healing?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whenever Gyeon Gang-hyeon became the target, Ja Hyeong-woo went blind and couldn’t properly calculate healing intensity. He always leaned toward excessive waste.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This had gradually become noticeable to people in the world, and currently Ja Hyeong-woo was embroiled in controversy for showing favoritism toward Gyeon Gang-hyeon and not distributing healing fairly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To the point where his qualifications as leader were questioned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had also pointed this out to Ja Hyeong-woo several times. But Ja Hyeong-woo closed his ears and wouldn’t fix it. Rather, he only harbored anger toward those who pointed it out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Would it be possible to reason with someone who acted desperately as if he’d lost something once before, telling him that was wrong?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Excluding Gyeon Gang-hyeon, the value of all life was equal to Ja Hyeong-woo. That’s why Ja Hyeong-woo could be a hero in a life without him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the current Ja Hyeong-woo exists for only one person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sensation like his whole body being caressed by cool water was felt. Gyeon Gang-hyeon drowsily opened his dim eyes from dizziness. He stared at Ja Hyeong-woo’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His advanced healing skill, ‘Prayer That Draws Up Purifying Water’.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Excluding Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s fusion skills, the high-level skills used by successors have separate activation conditions beyond usage limits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the case of Ja Hyeong-woo’s skill—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The person being treated must stimulate his own fear, there must be desperation that this person cannot die.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had only seen this skill activated once in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a crisis where everyone seemed like they would be annihilated, it was a skill the original protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo used to save the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now everyone except the weakest person, himself, was fine. Even Gyeon Gang-hyeon himself, though his body ached and his arm was injured, his life wasn’t in danger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching Ja Hyeong-woo so naturally, without a single doubt, pour high-grade healing on him, Gyeon Gang-hyeon finally closed his eyes tightly and admitted it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I tried to help him… but I guess I ruined Ja Hyeong-woo.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current Ja Hyeong-woo could never catch up to the original Ja Hyeong-woo. He was destined to become increasingly lax.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘As long as I’m by your side.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between the torn fabric, Ja Hyeong-woo wiped away the red marks on his skin with his hand. When the blood was cleared away, clean skin was visible. Ja Hyeong-woo let out a sigh of relief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Ja Hyeong-woo was fighting the urge to stroke the small, round head lying on the ground, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s lips slowly opened and he whispered with his eyes closed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It’s burdensome.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze settled on his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after embedding Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words letter by letter in his chest, he opened his mouth in response without showing much pain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you know?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ve known since long ago.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then violent waves arose around Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not the person you know…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He almost shouted in anger, then shut his mouth on his own. While heavily receiving Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze, he slowly relaxed his facial muscles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had completely opened his eyes, lightly pushed Ja Hyeong-woo away and sat up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if the previous conversation hadn’t happened, seeing that the remaining people had moved toward where the boss myodusa was in the brief moment, he rolled his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boss, whose location they couldn’t even properly identify until now, seemed to have the ability to control rock islands to make them crash into each other or destroy them entirely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After several loud crashes, the rock island had transformed into an even more cinematic scene. To put it nicely, it was dramatic; to put it badly, it was fucked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The island that had caused chain collisions was divided into hundreds of pieces, and all those fragments were pushed into the air and were now floating around. It had been a seriously dangerous situation, but fortunately all six people neither fell nor were hit by large debris.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, they had relocated the position of the white crack that was their entrance. Woo Sae-geon had positioned Sa Ye-ho, Jin Seol-woon, and Hae Mi-jun on the rock island where the entrance was located.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While keeping an eye on the rock island carrying the boss myodusa flying toward them like an airship.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You guys secure the entrance. Even if the boss tries to destroy this side, the ox familiar will block it to some extent. It still might not be enough, so you guys help too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Riding Jin Seol-woon’s dragon familiar, Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Ja Hyeong-woo also joined them. Gyeon Gang-hyeon frowned as he got off the dragon with Ja Hyeong-woo’s support.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you determined to destroy your body before retirement? You’re going to catch that alone without even a familiar?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon ignored him again. However, it wasn’t a cold attitude as if it wasn’t worth listening to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was just a non-response meaning to shut up and watch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho let out a long, frustrated breath through his nose. Even so, he didn’t try to stop Woo Sae-geon. He just watched calmly. His back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon advanced alone toward the boss monster, lightly stepping on debris. Even though one wrong step would mean falling into a thousand-foot abyss, there was no possibility of that happening to him. He didn’t even seem to look at his feet much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His venomous and emotionless gaze demanded to slaughter the giant monster placed one-on-one in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For him, his comrades were also a kind of shackle. When there was nothing to be concerned about, when no one was behind him, Woo Sae-geon surpassed all previous versions of himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in a situation covered with disgraceful controversy, he would create a moment to be remembered by people as unforgettable thrills and be talked about by junior hunters for life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunder that seemed capable of bringing down the whole world rang out from his right sword raised higher than his head. Monstrous strength to split the earth in two was embedded in his left sword. He fell toward the monster like a meteor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Pioneer (Earth Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Advanced skills are bound to have activation conditions. Woo Sae-geon’s advanced skill also had one activation condition hidden like other skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If this surprisingly simple condition wasn’t met, his skill wouldn’t manifest either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Have confidence in myself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But if nothing else… I can’t stand by and watch people disparage the dedication that person made for Korea.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Earth-colored patterns covered all of Woo Sae-geon’s visible skin – face, neck, and hands. It looked like tattoos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strong explosion occurred that pushed away all the floating rocks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Yang Pyo could make his body hard as stone, Jin Seol-woon could move between heaven and earth, and Gyeon Gang-hyeon could make earth surge up or sink down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon possessed all the characteristics of earth successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having chosen to jump into the boss monster’s maw himself, he also came out by his own will. Inside, he tore and ripped everything within reach, bursting flesh and organs. He turned over the corpse, took the magic stone, and returned covered in blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To where the others were waiting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A reenactment of the Rodeo incident…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone stared at Woo Sae-geon with dumbfounded faces. Soon in the silence, someone stepped forward with traditional clothing rustling along their body. They met Woo Sae-geon halfway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>

  Snake Successor&gt;Me: Hyung, this way we can’t even get an adult rating

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing Sa Ye-ho’s chat, Woo Sae-geon finally checked his own appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a mess. It was harder to find places not stained with monster blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Sa Ye-ho unhesitatingly placed his hand on Woo Sae-geon’s shoulder, which was mottled with blood and organs. Using it as support, he lifted his body up and reached his ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because you’re sexy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ack! Impact struck the back of his head. Woo Sae-geon hit Sa Ye-ho’s head with his other hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho made “oww…” sounds and overacted, but still laughed foolishly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s advanced skill, said to awaken someone into a greater demon than monsters, was used only once and disappeared forever.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was ‘Woo Sae-geon’s’ last appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The controversy ended with no charges even before Woo Sae-geon left school for investigation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At Korea’s repeated requests for cooperation, America expedited the investigation, and it was revealed that Woo Sae-geon had no contact with drugs during his residence in America.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Of course. They announce something so obvious quickly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon thought while replaying the stage clear video once. Sickeningly, Woo Sae-geon insisted on conducting the feedback meeting until the very end, so he had to leave in 10 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While watching the video, Gyeon Gang-hyeon focused on and mulled over Woo Sae-geon’s indecisive behavior throughout the stage rather than the combat itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But one speculation he could only make now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Don’t tell me Woo Sae-geon was acting on purpose?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Acting like his mentality had snapped and he was spacing out, to see what the remaining people would do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Come to think of it, all the leader candidates except Myo Cho-hui were gathered in this stage.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And that composition was, of course, arranged by Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was deceived. By that bastard Woo Sae-geon he should destroy. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face gradually turned white.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the stage Woo Sae-geon had set up, the person who found the method to clear the myodusa and looked at each team member’s abilities to give orders was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, what had he blabbered to the camera?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Calling the leader such a person is insulting all of us successors who put that person in the leader position.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah! So embarrassing, damn it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Gyeon Gang-hyeon was pulling his hair out in bitter regret for what he’d done.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon officially submitted documents about the next general manager to the association. He exercised his 40% decision-making power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The top priority candidate I have selected as former leader is Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon.]
