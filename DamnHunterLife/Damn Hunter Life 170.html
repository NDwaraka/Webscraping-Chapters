  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 170
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When I first became a successor, I was incredibly excited. I thought I was born with athletic abilities for this day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is getting longer than expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I felt like I was the protagonist of the world, like I’d become a hero from a comic. My colleagues also seemed more like comic or movie characters rather than actual people. It didn’t feel very real.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You call that kind of thing a secret? At this late stage?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry, but everyone already knows you think that way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t interrupt me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s true nature came out for a moment. She shot back mercilessly then returned to reminiscence mode again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Somehow everyone looked so clean and neat…… like characters. I wasn’t in my right mind either, thinking of living people as characters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What is she trying to say with all this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who had been rambling on, suddenly stood up from the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What? Why is she kneeling? Is she crazy?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll confess. Leader. I’m a diligent member of the official Twelve Zodiac community.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why the sudden formal speech? And she called me Leader? Not Dog?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just stared blankly at her, still unable to understand the context.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So…… I’m a member who plays around pairing the Leader with Mouse oppa…… Hyeong-woo oppa, Ye-ho oppa, and Seol-woon oppa.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah started calling the successors by their real names instead of animal names…… but wait, what?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What the hell!?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I had witnessed in the community just before becoming leader came flooding back. I now know what kind of delusions that community is full of.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why on earth do they pair me with men, and why not just one person but several people, and why is Ma Cheon-ah doing this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was gaping in disbelief, Ma Cheon-ah shamelessly straightened her knees, stood up, and grinned wickedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If this gets out about me, my image will hit rock bottom. So Leader, keep it secret too. I’ll keep yours secret too. Now do you trust me? Isn’t this enough to call it even?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had only one thing to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Quit!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No way!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah squirmed as if hugging something invisible. I stomped my foot in front of her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How can you do such a thing? Are you really crazy!?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then don’t be so pretty!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you crazy!?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It feels like Ma Cheon-ah and I became closer…… like hell, we became more distant. In the midst of this, Ma Cheon-ah went even further and said flowery nonsense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But then are you really dating Hyeong-woo oppa? Was this ship actually real?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s treatment! I clearly said treatment, but that bastard is hearing only what she wants to hear!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I fired off harsh criticism asking if she was crazy, how she could do such a thing, and whether she treats me like a human being. When my cursing got long, Ma Cheon-ah also got worked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We said we’d keep each other’s secrets! This is breach of contract!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Keeping secrets is one thing! As a leader, can I just let a member engage in unwholesome activities? There’s successor dignity to maintain. Quit immediately!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, Ma Cheon-ah looked like death and deleted her community account in front of me. She defended like a fortress, saying she’d rather die than show me things like search history or viewing lists.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s gotten into her head? To think I raised a tiger cub, no, a horse cub!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t talk to me from now on!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I never talked to you anyway?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There wasn’t even a drop of affection between us who shared secrets. Only harsh words were exchanged. At least I had sent everyone 50 meters away from the office, thank goodness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After grumbling for a long time and banishing Ma Cheon-ah from my space, my head finally cooled down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Sigh, right. Ma Cheon-ah isn’t the problem. The problem is that I’ve been getting carried around everywhere because I lack energy. They say you can’t even drink cold water in front of children.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This kind of thing is just a simple happening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I’m anxious to death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing Maegu made it even more certain. I could see signs that something strange was about to happen around me. But I couldn’t get a sense of what it was. I need to know what it is to at least try to deal with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slowly retraced the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The original work’s final chapter. ……But there was no Gang-hyeon in the original.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or perhaps it seemed…… like there wasn’t one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lost in deep thought, I briefly stopped by home and found Beom I-ryeong, who was staying at my house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was taking a break during training. I like resting at hyung-nim’s house.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing the boy who ran out to greet me, my heart somehow sank with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think I know what I should be suspicious of.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During the 22nd stage boss strategy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ice ability that Hae Mi-jun newly created not only effectively captured the cursed dolls but also helped in eliminating the boss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His attack skill could have manifested as a partial anesthesia skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Hae Mi-jun’s current disposition rejected that change. What suited him was blocking and protecting something, not directly causing harm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The technique that originated from his desire to earn a place beside Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now became a technique that allowed Gang-hyeon and Ja Hyeong-woo to be together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon handed over the main healing position to Ja Hyeong-woo and checked on Hae Mi-jun, who was contributing to combat, throughout the battle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To him, the feelings that his younger colleague harbored for Gang-hyeon were immediately visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather, to Gang-hyeon himself, it probably wasn’t visible, hidden by their initial relationship of training together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That person has no awareness in that direction.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a long time, a soft smile spread across his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For someone who chatters quite well, he never talked about old times at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was because he had spent a long time in the hospital.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that fact became known, Jin Seol-woon had casually asked Ja Hyeong-woo about it. He was curious what the man who was Gang-hyeon’s childhood friend would say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said that while Gang-hyeon was often sickly and couldn’t do physical activities well, there were no symptoms in elementary school. If there had been, there’s no way he wouldn’t have known.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And at that moment. A cold voice giving orders was heard. Jin Seol-woon’s reverie was broken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon, give me your dragon and jump down! Mountain skill!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon gladly entrusted himself to him. Without even a moment’s hesitation, he suddenly jumped down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day after the strategy was completed. Jin Seol-woon received his contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Can you meet me today?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon came to find him first. He made time despite being busy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although he was someone who had shown burdensome feelings toward him, Gang-hyeon wanted to show courtesy to Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if Jin Seol-woon was also precious to him to some degree.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon exhaled deeply, feeling the deepest tension of his life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wanted to return this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon took out a broken S-grade sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s eyes took in the sword that closely resembled his own, but was broken in the middle and split into two pieces. Also the thin, white fingers that set the sword down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The relationship between the two began with this sword and ends with this sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The events of that time passed by like a revolving lantern.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first, he had only given it as a gesture of gratitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gang-hyeon first swung this sword and spat blood. He was so shocked when he heard about it later. He even thought he shouldn’t have given it to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that this sword caused Gang-hyeon and himself to become the subject of people’s gossip was initially bewildering. But gradually it became pleasant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only it were possible, he had hoped this sword would never leave Gang-hyeon’s side until the day he died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sword returned too quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry for breaking it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I saw everything about how it got broken.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This sword broke its own body instead of its owner. If the sword hadn’t broken, that impact might have collided directly with Gang-hyeon and killed him instantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll make you a new one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon didn’t move his eyes and only moved his lips slightly. He spoke a bit quickly. Perhaps some urgency had mixed in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And when Gang-hyeon met his gaze looking at him gently, all the impurities surrounding him crumbled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You know how I’ll answer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In those eyes, Jin Seol-woon’s heart settled more than he himself was surprised by.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. I know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s grateful to the one who came to listen to his words first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you can’t stop my mouth right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had winced around his eyes a little, soon straightened his back and sat upright. He seemed to be conscious of the atmosphere, which looked quite amusing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s because Gang-hyeon-ssi is attractive.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he blurted that out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s face became as if he’d been slapped. Jin Seol-woon leaned his upper body forward and continued speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It seems like it wouldn’t hurt even if I put you in my eyes, and it makes me smile. As an idol, I liked Gang-hyeon-ssi so much that I dreamed of dating another man.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other person is trying his best to manage his expression. But his eyes kept twitching. Jin Seol-woon wanted to laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But instead of laughing, he drew out the power he had used to captivate others in front of cameras.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Think carefully about what I said. If you’ve thought about it, and if you think you know yourself a bit……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to leave today as an unforgettable scene for Gang-hyeon. Now his mission was only to let him know that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Take a look at the person beside Gang-hyeon-ssi then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The place he returned to was shrouded in darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shadows created by furniture stood up jaggedly. Jin Seol-woon sat on a small dark chair among them and melted into part of the darkness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Flutter, he lifted the sheet music that had been sleeping in the drawer above his head to read it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, he couldn’t let him hear this song.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quietly looking at the notes and lyrics written on the sheet music, he lay down lengthwise on the chair and placed the sheet music on his chest. The sheet music didn’t slide off and stayed still on his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s something he can’t take outside Hunter School anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then when he retires in a few years, he can just forget this too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The song’s melody and all the lyrics are already filling my whole body.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if he leaves it behind, he won’t be able to forget it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when he goes out and returns to daily life, he’ll remember it note for note without a single mistake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He might end up writing it down again somewhere because he can’t forget it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t say I don’t hope he’ll come to me if he breaks up with Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he’s already become pathetic, he conjured up another wish with his closed eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That the song he composed would be the best among the self-composed songs he’d create in the future.
 </span>
</p>
