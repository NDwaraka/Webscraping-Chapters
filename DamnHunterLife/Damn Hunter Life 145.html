  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 145
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sight of his back being dirtied with the fluid Ja Hyeong-woo had shot was unbearably shameful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both the sensation of the thick, clumped substance flowing down, and Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze that would be watching it all with his own two eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon slowly got up and wiped off the fluid with a towel. Though he was trembling from shock that hadn’t subsided, his hands were somewhat hurried. His body shook finely as he reached his arms behind to scrub it off. He also quickly put his clothes back on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once the climax was completely over, Ja Hyeong-woo’s reason gradually returned too. He tucked his cock back into his underwear before Gang-hyeon could see and wiped the sweat that had formed on his temples.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How are you feeling now? Do you have energy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having been so immersed that he unconsciously pressed his glans firmly against the dry back while ejaculating, it was ridiculous to now pretend to be rational and look for the original purpose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting aside a response, Gang-hyeon didn’t even seem to be listening to his words. His eyes looking somewhere between the sofa back and the floor seemed vacant somehow. He looked as if his soul had left him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it that much of a shock…? The words he swallowed internally pricked his heart painfully. Even while feeling a sense of loss shake his head, Ja Hyeong-woo tried to move his mouth to spit out an apology.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, the sound he heard wasn’t his own voice. Ja Hyeong-woo was bewildered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon he realized he hadn’t misheard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, staring at the wall, was making intermittent sounds in his throat. What had seemed like a vacant state was because his mood had sunk terribly low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that appearance, none of his usual thorns could be found.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’d be ashamed doing such things too. And I have nothing I can give you in return. …I’m sorry for being too weak, for making it so you can’t let me go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t say anything in the shock of his thoughts endlessly crumbling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if Gang-hyeon was speaking in an unknown language, he couldn’t understand anything. Even the thoughts he barely managed to recall all split and crumbled before they could come out of his mouth. The blood in his entire body didn’t just cool but completely froze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words of apology, the words about being burdensome. These were all things Ja Hyeong-woo should be saying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That this… was Gang-hyeon’s true feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice choked as he called out and placed his hand on his forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just where did you start thinking so wrongly? And why didn’t you say anything to me about it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Why wasn’t I honest with you?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. Gang-hyeon. Why are you thinking like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His mind, which had been blinded by impatience, suddenly snapped to attention. Due to the sharp pain that stabbed his heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What must Gang-hyeon have felt offering his back just now? What it’s like to beg while embracing a sick body and abandoning one’s pride.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon slumped on the sofa looked tired. He was red as if he’d been crying and his voice had sunk low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to stroke and soothe him. He wanted to put him to sleep. Even in this moment, hot and throbbing emotions surged within Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the person in question doesn’t know to the very end what kind of feelings Ja Hyeong-woo harbors for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as much as he himself had treated Ja Hyeong-woo coldly… he thinks Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t like him either. No, he forces himself to believe that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just as I still can’t be certain of your intentions… you don’t seem to know me well either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo gathered all his courage and moved his body. Steps heavy as stone fell. He slowly approached the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That makes me miserable.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the fact that Gang-hyeon wasn’t finding any fault with his words, and from the fact that he was at least listening to Ja Hyeong-woo’s words without avoiding him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not over yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s weight settled right next to him. Gang-hyeon looked over in a somewhat dazed state, his tired eyelids half-closed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he flinched, his eyelashes trembling. Ja Hyeong-woo’s face was at a much closer distance than expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As his pupils dilated greatly within his large, pretty eyes, a gravitational pull that drew Ja Hyeong-woo in was created. Ja Hyeong-woo pushed his upper body a little more forward. Their nose tips touched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His ears became muffled. In the silence where only each other’s breathing could be heard, Gang-hyeon held his breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The strange atmosphere and hesitation. His whole body being restrained even though the other person wasn’t even touching him. He knew from experiencing it with Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the stillness before a kiss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To call this also part of treatment, his gaze was absolutely not within the normal range. The skin where his gaze settled tingled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Ja Hyeong-woo is…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he exhaled the tense tension between his lower and upper lips, the remaining distance was devoured in one go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo kissed him right before his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Ja Hyeong-woo pressed his lips firmly and nibbled at his closed lips as if trying to gently release them, Gang-hyeon, who had gone pale, revealed all his thoughts through his eyes. No way. No. No way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even when he tried to deny it, Ja Hyeong-woo wouldn’t allow it. Every time their lips parted, he desperately tried to regain his senses, but each time Ja Hyeong-woo would bring his face close again and sweep between both lips with his tongue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smack, smack. Strange sounds rang out several times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Ja Hyeong-woo let out a heavy breath and whispered softly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ve been lacking yang energy all this time. You probably thought the mouse familiar had been treating you all along… but actually, I was the one treating you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…What have you been doing to me all this time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pressing voice was completely drained of strength. Perhaps it was because his lips were too close and uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if that were the case, he could just back away like in the training room earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo felt his heart pounding as if it would burst through his chest muscles. Since their bodies were pressed closely together, Gang-hyeon would probably hear it all too. But he no longer hid it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know how you’ll think about hearing this, but I wanted to do it from the beginning. Even if you call me a pervert, I have nothing to say.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he would die if he didn’t speak now, he thrust out his true feelings as they came to mind. After being flattened for too long, even simple words didn’t come out easily. His way with words was far from adequate, making it even more difficult.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you need to know this. It was because it was you…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He should have confessed long ago. Because he spoke too late, he made Gang-hyeon think unnecessary thoughts. Now even telling him every day for the rest of his life wouldn’t be enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But being a little selfish, he thought it was fortunate it was now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t dislike kissing you or other things either. …I’ll talk about it in more detail later. When you’re ready to listen.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just from ejaculating on his back, there was enough heat in Gang-hyeon’s body. He didn’t need more treatment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet the reason Ja Hyeong-woo was saying these things and bringing his face close again was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had become dazed, inadvertently allowed the next kiss too, and even when Ja Hyeong-woo’s tongue parted his lips and entered, he still couldn’t cope.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The thick tongue entwined and sucked at the small hesitant one. Only then did Gang-hyeon startle. His foot shot out toward Ja Hyeong-woo’s side like a kick.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s tongue, twitching in bewilderment, tried to push out the flesh in his mouth. Ja Hyeong-woo quickly cupped the small back of his head with his hand and poked with his tongue tip at the parts that made him react well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The surprised moan was swallowed into Ja Hyeong-woo’s mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While intensely meeting the eyes that were hazy with moisture as if about to cry, Ja Hyeong-woo deliberately created gaps between their lips and moved his tongue to make wet, squelching sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then blood rushed to his pale cheeks, instantly turning them red. His enlarged eyes trembled violently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If blood rushed this quickly, he’d get dizzy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having treated Gang-hyeon continuously day and night, Ja Hyeong-woo knew Gang-hyeon’s body better than Gang-hyeon himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet even Ja Hyeong-woo found restraint difficult. He put strength into the hand pressing the back of his head. He sucked mercilessly without giving time for saliva to pool in his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d actually been curious all along. How would Gang-hyeon act if they kissed while he was awake?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh, hah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His reddened eye corners and lips gasping from exhaling hot breath. As expected, it stimulated his lust.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pale face that had been struggling to resist gradually became hazy with pleasure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That sight drove Ja Hyeong-woo out of his mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just staying still seemed difficult for Gang-hyeon as he writhed even when his sensitive inner flesh was barely swept with tongue. Like a child who had just stopped running, he couldn’t find his proper breathing rhythm and his chest heaved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He knew that apart from his stubborn temperament in everything, he was innocent, but he hadn’t expected him to be this weak to stimulation. Ja Hyeong-woo focused while flexing the muscles throughout his body. Eerie excitement pooled in his stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moving together felt much better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyebrows curved downward. He slowly overlapped their lips again soothingly, giving Gang-hyeon time to catch his breath. He guided Gang-hyeon’s lost hands to grip his clothes tightly and naturally pulled his waist closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before long, soft hair was scattered on the sofa. Gang-hyeon, who had unknowingly been laid back, looked up in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before the one trapped below could express rejection, Ja Hyeong-woo braced his arm above Gang-hyeon’s head, lowered his head, and swallowed his lips again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But… the delicate lips obediently parted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The joy of finally receiving a response and the pleasure that stabbed and heated his lower abdomen overflowed above Ja Hyeong-woo’s reason. His cock, which had been precarious from the moment he first covered his lips, swelled as it was and cast a huge bulge. Because Ja Hyeong-woo had slightly lifted his body, Gang-hyeon was unaware of that situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, even if they had been touching from the start, he wouldn’t have realized. He was too busy trying to collect himself from his first pleasure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm, mm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sensation of him rummaging inside his mouth and making sucking sounds wouldn’t end no matter how much he endured and held out. Eventually Gang-hyeon gave up the staring contest first and closed his eyes.
 </span>
