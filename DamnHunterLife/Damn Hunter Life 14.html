 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 14
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My ambitiously delivered line.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……didn’t impress him in the slightest – there wasn’t even a trace of warmth in Jin Seol-woon’s eyes. Even when looking at recyclables being thrown away, his gaze would be warmer than this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that so? Do you know that just being here right now is causing me harm?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because he was a musician, his voice was gentle and deep. And there, there was a blade.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, so you’re here because you don’t know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere turned sharply cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then what I needed was a change of topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pointed my thumb at the screen behind me. The video was now showing the second verse bridge section.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That part’s good. No, the whole song is good. The chorus is addictive too, and it really brings out the members’ strengths so the fandom reaction is overwhelming.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just look at the view count on this video. It already hit number 1 on streaming sites. Music show first place seems like a sure thing too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did he think I came to see Jin Seol-woon without even thinking about this much?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This guy is actually hearing this new song for the first time. How about it? Now that you’re facing what you’ve been avoiding?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While my mouth chattered away earnestly, my eyes blatantly scrutinized Jin Seol-woon’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Usually when someone stares this intensely, they’d feel awkward or look away, but Jin Seol-woon wasn’t that easy. Without turning away from our locked gaze, he soon replied matter-of-factly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s good. The members practiced hard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He probably has other thoughts stirring in his heart, but he speaks so calmly and composedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But you responded, didn’t you? You’re already caught up in conversation with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally you wouldn’t even exchange words with Gyeon Gang-hyeon, right? This is probably the first conversation between Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But the music video feels a bit empty without Eshi. Both visually and vocally.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I blatantly mentioned his stage name, giving him praise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the guy who would have humbly smiled and acted honored if he’d heard this from fans or adults, instead narrowed his eyes as if trying to figure out my intentions. Only the shadows under his eyelashes deepened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, I didn’t expect this guy to let his guard down quickly just from my half-hearted compliments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Praise like that – he would have heard naturally from cute fans, even from birth.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And actually, right now he doesn’t really want to hear the name Eshi either, does he?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you buttering me up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His attitude of not bothering to choose more polite expressions made a chilly atmosphere settle in the room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I knew Jin Seol-woon wouldn’t be easy. The method I chose to win him over wasn’t the meek approach of unconditionally yielding and giving in, so it was natural that each word felt like walking on thin ice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I told myself that it was natural for him to despise me, that it was all within the original story information and my expected range, but—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because I’m your fan.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even I’m not completely fearless when deliberately spouting nonsense while looking up at the heavens.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An even deeper chill settled in Jin Seol-woon’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally, he could tell it was a lie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no hobby of following male idols, and all my disguise consisted of was hastily memorizing things I’d searched online before approaching Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And sure enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So you came here to talk nonsense.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who whispered lowly, summoned a weapon from his inventory. The sheathed sword’s presence was menacing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t think Jin Seol-woon is the type to use violence. But I can’t be 100% certain either. I quickly got my follow-up words out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you at least hear what my intention is in saying these things?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Jin Seol-woon smiled like this in his last performance, let me try it once too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m doing this to make a good impression on you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When someone finally smiles, the other person’s expression just got colder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon is different from Hae Mi-jun. This one isn’t easy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He already has hostility toward me, and he’s not naive but smart, so he’s not the type to readily accept my goodwill.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wasn’t he someone who debuted at 18 and rolled around in the fierce entertainment industry?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He would have experienced far more unpleasant things in the industry, so that expression would never crumble from ordinary provocations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the opponent has a more difficult shield, then I also—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even at the risk of being counterattacked, I have no choice but to thrust a more direct spear.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But it’s kind of… disappointing. Innate and their agency. Eshi is working himself to death as a hunter, but whose popularity is it thanks to, and how can they make a comeback without Eshi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s expression changed differently. That is, to a level where his previous coldness seemed like child’s play.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, I don’t stop talking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you can’t get on stage together, couldn’t they at least make the album and music source versions include your voice?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is why it’s advantageous for me to keep dragging along the delinquent image.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon remembers the last stage he performed on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The final broadcast of the music show. The choreography with the members that day was particularly perfect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rotating as if drawing lines on the ground with his knees, then rising. The formation changes. The youngest member, one year younger who had been at center, steps back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He takes the lead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The scene of colorful light sticks embroidering the dark audience seats, the spotlight shooting toward him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was where Jin Seol-woon belonged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Climbing the stairs, opening my eyes
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hey, can you notice me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Welcoming all the world’s dreams
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The thrill racing through my heart Right here
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sparkling droplets of sweat glitter as they pass before his eyes. An ad-lib that he didn’t usually do bursts out. He winks his left eye toward the camera.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Along with the eyelid that blinked without him knowing, darkness seized his vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A dream. Jin Seol-woon, waking from sleep, looked at the ceiling with hazy eyes. The silence in the room erased the vivid sensation that had seemed like returning to that day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The momentary surge of emotion, and the emptiness that came when he realized it was an illusion, unusually didn’t last long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he had slept and woken up, something else was troubling Jin Seol-woon’s mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I lost my composure back then.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, it was time for blanket-kicking regret.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the sight of Gyeon Gang-hyeon criticizing the agency and Innate, he had lost his mind and lashed out in anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That interview the other day was quite something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if saying, you think only you can speak rudely? He had spoken just as fiercely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I would never do such a thing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How could someone curse at reporters like that? Could there really be such an arrogant person?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon really is a delinquent. A wastrel with no hope of rehabilitation. He had revealed through his expression that he thought so.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you had just awakened, I wouldn’t be without time to sing right now. You claim to be my fan, but you’re only getting in my way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It doesn’t matter who started it first. Jin Seol-woon was now equally guilty of saying hurtful things to someone he’d just met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To fall to the same level as that person.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon buried his head in his pillow and gripped the innocent sheets tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He touched my family first.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet why did Gyeon Gang-hyeon, far from being discouraged, go on to talk about other things as if he knew something?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he had been waiting for Jin Seol-woon to react that way from the beginning……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine, let’s say I awakened. So you got some breathing room. Would you have sung then?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Honestly, at that moment Jin Seol-woon felt like Gyeon Gang-hyeon had seen right through him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Probably not? You can do it even now, but you’re not doing it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t even get angry about what gave him the confidence to make such assumptions. Because of Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words that followed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……It must be his imagination. It has to be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the delinquent Gyeon Gang-hyeon, the disgrace of successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the Dragon successor, but you’re also Eshi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s no way such a person’s words could shake him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re worrying about something, just do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon impulsively turned on his phone. He squinted briefly at the bright light, then pressed on his previous message history and scrolled down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He saw messages exchanged with Innate’s leader Seong Yuhan from a couple months ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Seol-woon, please please please please? Come on? Listen to hyung, I already got agreement from the boss and producer.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Let’s put your voice in the music source. It’s an event for fans! Hey, Gift is already going crazy missing you, imagine if Eshi is at least in the music source. Kya~ Can’t you see our rabbit-like fans would flip with joy?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Don’t worry if it’s because that school doesn’t have sound equipment! Just record it and they’ll handle the mixing here!]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The composer said the intro was almost made for you!]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What had he replied back then?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Feeling his tongue turn bitter, Jin Seol-woon slowly looked at the message he had sent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I’m grateful you thought of me but I’m really sorry
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m having a hard time adapting to training…… Even if I record, it won’t come out with the same quality as before. I’ll join when there’s a chance later. Thank you.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, he doesn’t regret making that decision then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when today, the comeback day, arrived.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But actually…… saying he couldn’t do it because it was hard was just an excuse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon wanted to sing. Since he didn’t need to sleep, he wanted to practice and record. He absolutely didn’t want to refuse with his own mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Yuhan hyung, I’m doing the important work of protecting South Korea.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If someone like me neglects my duty to sing songs, our fans might welcome it, but…… would the public think the same?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the backlash would hit Innate, our team.
 </span>
</p>
