  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 70
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the person in question, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, seems not to have grasped the implication of the proposal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to? You can do it at your house. Come to think of it, why are you here today?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, leaning against the wall, quietly swallowed a sigh. At the words he heard, the strength naturally drained from his fists, yet he was disgusted with himself for feeling relieved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon subtly avoided Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I also sometimes do it here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was going crazy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were up to his heart, he had more than enough to make such proposals like Jin Seol-woon. But this relationship, where he couldn’t do so because he had to act cold, was resentful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been receiving reports from the Mouse Familiar about things other than Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s physical condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had ordered it to inform him whenever Gyeon Gang-hyeon made contact with other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, Ja Hyeong-woo could know in real time when and with whom Gyeon Gang-hyeon had been. If he wanted, he could go and butt in. He’d actually done it several times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He seems to go anywhere as long as I’m not there.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even goes to Yang Pyo’s house to sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just hearing that Gyeon Gang-hyeon is with someone else only makes him feel bad, but he also can’t stand not knowing at all…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s awakening, Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t even aware that he couldn’t focus on training like before. He swept up the hair on his forehead while exhaling a frustrated breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hot. It’s hot…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For me, whose body is cool enough to live comfortably without air conditioning even in midsummer, the sensation of heat is truly rare. Maybe my body is sick. Do I have a fever?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I opened my eyes, an unfamiliar scene spread before me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  White smoke poured out from collapsed buildings here and there. Red colors stabbed my eyes painfully throughout my field of vision. They were bloodstains from fallen people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body moved with great difficulty. It creaked and felt heavy as if invisible strings were tangled all around. I desperately looked around to see if there were any living people. My vision shook wildly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I discovered it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A black gate. A high-grade gate. In front of it, Ja Hyeong-woo stood dazed, his hair disheveled and fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Empty hands. His staff had fallen below.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Couldn’t you heal people with that? A sharp metallic sound burst from my throat. Then I soon realized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Korea’s top healer’s S-grade weapon had lost its light and was broken in half like a rotten tree branch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart pounded. Only after groping with my eyes several times did I understand the context.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That wasn’t broken due to a monster attack or external shock. An S-grade weapon shouldn’t break from such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …It seemed the weapon had broken first on behalf of its owner’s overexerted body, because the weapon’s owner had drawn out abilities at too high an intensity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo lifted his wounded face to the sky. He didn’t notice me. Though his expression was surprisingly dry, he seemed to have lost everything, making the observer’s mind feel numb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh… mmm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I woke from the dream with a groaning sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My arms and legs, which wouldn’t move no matter how much I struggled, could finally be felt. My breathing was too rapid, so I couldn’t lift my head and panted for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Small blue hands were patting my shoulder, then stopped when they confirmed I was awake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky’s faint face was looking at me from beside my pillow. It seemed like it had tried to shake me awake directly. Its hand swept back my hair that was damp with sweat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon a brown-haired boy scurried over to the bedside. He carefully floated a water cup above his two hands and handed it to me. Even though I couldn’t see his face clearly, I could feel that the puppy was sniffling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thanks, guys.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time was around 7 AM. I was still sleepy, but my head was too complicated to want to sleep more. I covered myself with the blanket and leaned against the wall to think.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, there were occasional scenes of successors including Ja Hyeong-woo having such dreams. And now the same thing had happened to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it was a prophetic dream or not wasn’t revealed until the middle part I had read…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s no such thing as 0 percent in this world, and anything has the possibility of being realized. This dream is no different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo’s skill report that he submitted this time, I saw it too…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The most recent stage was Stage 33. Comparing to the original work based on this, the current Ja Hyeong-woo had fewer skills and lower maximums than in the original. Most importantly, one advanced healing skill hadn’t manifested.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is that why I had such a dream? Because I’m anxious?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current Ja Hyeong-woo is more sluggish than in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I provoked him hard saying his training was insufficient, but was that still not enough? Honestly, at that level he’s working so hard he has no personal life… Is his mind slack? It did seem that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe there’s a bit less stimulation than when the original Gyeon Gang-hyeon died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I need to plant new motivation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now that I’ve made up my mind, I need to convey my opinion to the leader as soon as possible. That human might already be on the verge of submitting the roster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  7 AM is dawn for me, but wouldn’t Woo Sae-geon have woken up already? But does Woo Sae-geon even sleep? Isn’t he actually a ghost who doesn’t sleep?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was having reasonable doubts, an answer came quickly.
 </span>
</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  No, even if he was sleeping, he should maintain dignity, but this person just swore at me.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wrote “stuffy scholar” in the window then deleted it again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should annoy him more. Anyway, since an answer came, it means Woo Sae-geon is awake, so I called for voice communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since what I really needed to convey was serious, even if I didn’t do it, Woo Sae-geon would have called first out of frustration while talking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He answered the communication. As soon as we connected, I gave a warm morning greeting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Were you really sleeping? I thought as a leader you’d naturally wake up sharp at 6 o’clock. I’m a bit disappointed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Show some manners. Do you want me to crush you?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s voice cracked for a moment. However, when he spoke next, Woo Sae-geon’s voice had completely returned to normal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Business.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Have you finalized the next stage deployment roster?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Almost.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You haven’t submitted it yet, right? Please put me in there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It doesn’t matter if Woo Sae-geon sees me as a newcomer who’s blinded by money and achievements and can’t know their place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was going to explain a reason he could understand afterwards.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have a newly created skill I want to try.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Explain more.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the process that all successors have gone through. To Woo Sae-geon, offering all information and delegating overall authority for utilizing one’s abilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had once tried to avoid this, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now, there was no other way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can become a vessel that receives other attribute successors. I’ve experimented with Won Ha-ri too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The result. The effect created by using abilities with me as a medium was this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Namely, it became possible to mix other attributes into my attacks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, attacks where earth attribute and one other attribute are fused exist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the limitation was clear in that others couldn’t mix among themselves, and it was only possible centered around me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Can it actually be put to practical use?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. It’s usable right now, but I don’t know how much power it has.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon left me alone while lost in thought for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon he gave a halfhearted answer that he’d consider it, then cut off the communication without any notice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He should give a definite answer instead of saying he’ll consider it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it feels like asking for trouble, with this I’ve gained a chance to enter the stage where Ja Hyeong-woo is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that the scene I saw in the nightmare doesn’t become reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I plan to forcibly raise Ja Hyeong-woo’s abilities from beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, since I nod off all day if I’m even an hour short of my 10 hours of sleep, I slept a bit more. Until my wake-up time of 8 o’clock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, since there was no way I could wake up after just one more hour of sleep, having to eat lunch instead of breakfast is a later story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After gulping down the bone broth from the meal as if it were rice wine and setting down the empty bowl, I belatedly got pissed off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That human is threatening me using Ja Hyeong-woo?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon made essentially threatening remarks while spreading an unreasonable hypothesis about the original protagonist, saying that Ja Hyeong-woo only protects me but has no sense of responsibility toward citizens.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While giving off the nuance that he could spread that information anywhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So inevitably, I’m keeping my mouth shut for now and sharing all my body’s research results with Woo Sae-geon in detail… but I’m still not convinced. My insides are boiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Woo Sae-geon isn’t the type to try to bury me or anything, but… I’m just pissed off.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Calling at 7 AM to wake him up wasn’t enough to vent my anger. I quickly called Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Starting today, please give me one Woo Sae-geon TMI per day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let’s find that human’s weaknesses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something that could match Ja Hyeong-woo’s character controversy… like Woo Sae-geon actually having a big mole on his butt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won’t such top-secret information fall to me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You don’t tell me…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s voice dropped low. It was seriousness for the first time in a million years. What? Does he know something?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Do you like Sae-geon hyung?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I kill you?”
 </span>
</p>
