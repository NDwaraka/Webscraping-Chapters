  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 21
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the results Choi Jung-do discovers show that Gyeon Gang-hyeon is still non-awakened, then it’s just maintaining status quo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if he turns out to be awakened, then Woo Sae-geon has one more task on his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll have to turn that mad dog into a hunting dog, even if I have to hang him upside down.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if he’s a scoundrel, he needs to be shaped into something useful for stage conquest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he’s a successor, he could probably hide his awakening level if he put his mind to it. However, conversely, since Choi Jung-do is a regular hunter weaker than successors, there was one method he could use to detect the opponent’s awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……I understand. I’ll give it a try.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do’s method was as follows:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He just needs to make skin contact with Gyeon Gang-hyeon, whether it’s his arm or anywhere else. Choi Jung-do was an earth attribute hunter. If Gang-hyeon had awakened, he’d feel a tingling sensation the moment their skin touched since they’d have the same attribute. It’s the same reason why Woo Sae-geon absolutely never touches regular hunters – he says their flinching and blushing faces give him the creeps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so, timing his departure to match the afternoon hours when Gyeon Gang-hyeon would be going in and out of the training grounds, Choi Jung-do paced around in front of Gang-hyeon’s residence. And he reminded himself of his mission more solemnly than ever before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Touch him! He must touch Gyeon Gang-hyeon!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just turned a street corner and ended up in some ridiculous trouble.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I crashed my forehead into some guy’s chest and fell spectacularly. Since I fell backward and plopped down on my butt, this was like a traffic accident level collision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body was already precariously maintaining its health, so even small impacts were fatal. My tailbone sent shooting pains up my spine, and while I was grimacing, a hand extended toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry. Would you like to grab my hand and get up?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked up at the gentle, deep voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A guy around my age with a genuinely apologetic expression was extending his hand with the sun behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man I couldn’t identify even thinking back to the original work had a harmless expression. He seemed to have no ulterior motives, and it looked like it would be fine to take his hand and stand up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No thanks.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But would I do that? I struggled to get up on my own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how pathetically unhealthy I look, what’s with taking another guy’s hand? Not even his arm. How disgusting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I have to be suspicious of anyone who treats me kindly. Unless they’re crazy, who would be nice to the delinquent Gyeon Gang-hyeon inside Hunter School?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, except for Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite having his kindness rejected, the man showed no signs of wounded pride. Even more suspicious. The flustered-looking man kept fidgeting his hands in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you really alright?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do I look alright?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. Shall I help you get home?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Not necessary. Pay me back in points for medical bills and clothing costs. You know my name, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The damage is severe when you only wear simple clothes like this. Looking at my back, anyone could tell I was someone who’d fallen on their butt on dirt ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Move.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I faithfully continued my delinquent act today. Even though I was making a nasty-tempered expression, the other party wasn’t easy to deal with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, I’m a fan.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that guy was trying to get my attention, he was quite skilled at it. At this completely out-of-the-blue statement, I looked back at the man.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, is this how Jin Seol-woon felt? When I said I was his fan?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To think I’d experience this kind of role reversal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I fell for you after seeing your interview. Could you shake hands with me just once?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the man extended his hand for the second time, a strange feeling crept over me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is he fidgeting around like someone desperate to touch me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s your name?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Choi Jung-do.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Choi Jung-do, Choi Jung-do… I still don’t think I heard that name in the original work. Either he’s too much of an extra for me to remember, or he really never appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get lost.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After quite sincerely barking at him, I left the man behind and went into the bathroom inside the building.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was fortunate that I’d developed the habit of carrying spare simple clothes after the Ha Gwon-yeong incident last time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when I came out after changing, the man was still standing in the same spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is he following me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If so, I have my methods too. I went around to the back of the building, and the moment I disappeared from his sight, I activated my one and only skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [&lt;Boundary Between Life and Death (Water Attribute)&gt; skill activates.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I watched Choi Jung-do for a while as an invisible person, and since he still wouldn’t leave, I just left too. I got his name, so that’s enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m walking around at this time as if I’m going to sword classes, but actually there are officially no classes today. Strictly speaking, it’s a holiday.
 </span>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how many times I hear this program name, I can’t get used to it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That show is a regular group interview with the Twelve Zodiac successors. It was a broadcast in a format similar to a talk show.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I sniped the broadcasting station last time, many programs got swept away, so this is the biggest program among the few remaining official broadcasts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……Even Woo Sae-geon couldn’t get this one withdrawn.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the government directly recommends appearances, what more can a young man who’s only 24 years old refuse, even if he’s the eldest of the Twelve Zodiac?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned on my phone to check the preview content of this interview that would have appeared in various news articles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Ja Hyeong-woo Condition Controversy… What’s Really Behind Stage 26?&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, the biggest topic would be clarifying the controversy about the original protagonist’s physical condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And next, an issue big enough to cover up the controversy about the Twelve Zodiac’s only healer until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;The Youngest’s Moving Debut, Hae Mi-jun’s First Interview!&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I lowered my head and had a good laugh for a while. First, the preview narration was funny too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hae Mi-jun is probably frozen stiff.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Hae Mi-jun unusually didn’t call me first, I called him first. I told him congratulations, and to answer questions well and work hard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sure enough, he was trembling with nerves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“H-hyung… will I be able to speak well?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t worry, man. Just don’t do it like me. Easy, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I kept giggling, Hae Mi-jun, who had been hesitating, eventually giggled along with me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Such a high-maintenance guy. I put up with him because he listens to me well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about Hae Mi-jun for a moment, I soon felt complicated again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, Hae Mi-jun can’t appear on this broadcast at all. He just exists in the shadows, the same as me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then now that the original work has changed, am I the only successor who wasn’t invited to the interview?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The campus, emptied of students, somehow felt desolate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, this isn’t the time to be standing around dazed. I walked diligently and reached the scenic hill I’d spotted some time ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a prime spot with the shade of a big tree and a view down to all the regular hunter buildings, but surprisingly it was a place students didn’t know about well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When else would a delinquent like me get to enjoy the breeze if not at times like this?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today it’s hill climbing instead of working out. I barely made it up, half-dead. I plopped down in the shade of the tree and felt the gentle breeze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How much time passed like that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I, who had been getting slightly drowsy, came to my senses at the sound of someone coming up from below the hill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An awkward silence flowed for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wind that ruffled through my hair on top of the hill went down coolly and swayed Ja Hyeong-woo’s long tied hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is Ja Hyeong-woo coming here?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This wasn’t a place particularly mentioned in the original work. It’s not related to interviews either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  %Fed up with interviews, he escaped to another place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, I think I saw this kind of brief sentence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So did he escape? Like me…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With one knee bent as if climbing the hill, Ja Hyeong-woo stares intently at me. That unreadable gaze was quite mysterious and unfamiliar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you looking at? What about the interview?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I shot back even more defiantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Don’t you have anything else to say besides that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What am I supposed to say to him?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I just stared blankly, not understanding, Ja Hyeong-woo turned his body first. It was a motion as if being with me was worthless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally that guy should be nagging me or something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is he angry? But the only thing Ja Hyeong-woo had to be angry about was my provocation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Well, that’s going well. He needs to get angry to steel his heart and train hard. Korea’s safety depends on that guy.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But is it okay to be this hated by the original protagonist?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After thinking about it to some extent, I gave up. The spring weather was really nice. The fields were also lush and green, making my heart feel generous. It had been a while since I felt leisurely. I soon dozed off again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And woke up again. Another head appeared below the hill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What, was this actually a hot place that only I didn’t know about?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time, the guy saw me but climbed the hill without hesitation, stretching his long legs stride by stride. When Jin Seol-woon finally came to look down at me, I spoke first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How did you escape too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s break time.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who answered expressionlessly, readily sat down next to me. It was unexpected, but I didn’t bother telling him to leave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you meet Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How did he know? Did he see?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After thinking for a moment, I realized there was a clue in what I’d just said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you look closely, this guy is quick-witted. Is this what top idol experience gets you?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did you do when you met?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know why Jin Seol-woon is curious about that, but there wasn’t really anything to answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What would we do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I see.”
 </span>
</p>
