  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 143
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe it’s because I suffered severe mental trauma and came crawling into my den like an injured animal seeking shelter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt uneasy about Jin Seol-woon being in my space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also the fact that Jin Seol-woon had been waiting for me in the dark room with blackout curtains drawn, without even turning on the lights, like a predator stalking its prey.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why did he come?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s definitely not the type to cross lines like this. If anything, I would be the one crossing them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry for coming in without permission. But Gang-hyeon-ssi also has a record of doing this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the person speaking sounded as if such things weren’t important, his voice completely flat. Or perhaps his mind was focused on other thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting aside doing something he’d never done before, something was different. His face half-buried in the shadows was mysterious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I haven’t been here long. I just teleported to Gang-hyeon-ssi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did I notice the notification floating in my status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that I couldn’t even see this meant my mind was completely elsewhere…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Belatedly, I remembered my face that would still be bright red. I quietly slipped out through the doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll just go to the bathroom for a moment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking in the mirror, my face was even more of a sight. I encountered a face that should absolutely never be shown to others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is why Ja Hyeong-woo did that… that thing and stared at me intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no more blood left to rush to my head. What on earth must Jin Seol-woon have thought seeing this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Or maybe not. Maybe he’d think it’s because I’m sick. Come to think of it, why didn’t he ask if I’m okay?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I washed my face and came out, Jin Seol-woon peeled his back off the wall as if he’d been waiting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have something to say. It’s about Gang-hyeon-ssi’s body. I heard and found out some things.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something I don’t even know exactly myself, what did he hear from whom to find out?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you ready to listen?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because I felt anxious due to Jin Seol-woon’s presence, I didn’t feel like sitting down. I stood leaning against the opposite wall just like Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My legs didn’t hurt or feel weak. Unlike before I fell asleep. While I couldn’t pay attention to that point right now, I watched the movement of Jin Seol-woon’s lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi’s physical condition can’t be fixed with just a healer’s healing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly something like a terminal illness diagnosis came at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi’s dog belongs to ‘yang.’ So you created skills by receiving yin-type attribute energy to achieve harmony. But Gang-hyeon-ssi is absolutely lacking in that yang energy. You have something like a deficiency syndrome.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon wasn’t speaking to me in a reproachful way asking why I, the person involved, didn’t know. Nevertheless, I felt ashamed of myself. At the same time, I was flabbergasted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “And because of that, every time you used skills, Gang-hyeon-ssi was robbed of the yang energy you needed to survive. That’s why your body was getting worse. Seeming to harbor yin energy, seeming to have weak stamina…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head spun from the string of words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then how had I been alive until now? Without being aware of such crucial information…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if I already knew the answer to that question… I felt my lips, slightly more swollen than usual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A cool voice awakened my mind that was about to go blank. Jin Seol-woon didn’t let me think of other things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Still, there’s a way to endure it. You can make up for it by having someone else give you yang energy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon suddenly rolled up his shirt sleeves one by one. As if he’d gotten hot from rising temperature. I flinched at the sight of his snow-white arms moving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to help you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At neither slow nor fast speed, long legs crossed the middle of the room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon my right side was blocked by a solid bare forearm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon stood in front of me with his hand against the wall. My vision was restricted, and I could clearly see his sharply carved jaw, trained neckline, and the Adam’s apple that protruded and cast shadows. It was a distance so close it would be hard to forget.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Jin Seol-woon wasn’t touching any part of my body, my arms wouldn’t move as if I were tied up. Words wouldn’t come out either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A voice with a slightly trembling end rang right next to my cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A faint scent of cologne wafted over. Also Jin Seol-woon’s body scent that was hard to smell elsewhere, only coming from his house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As my sense of smell was stimulated, my throat that had been blocked as if paralyzed opened right up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His lips stopped without coming any closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a terribly hoarse voice, but as if that one word contained powerful force, Jin Seol-woon couldn’t move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I not allowed?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eyes like a perfect creation held a lyrical color. Though it seemed like deliberately flowing sensuality that made me feel repulsed, dry saliva went down my throat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head became dizzy again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You’re an idol.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Idols can’t do this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A slightly high-pitched and urgent, questioning tone followed without any gap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hesitated briefly on how to respond, but I, as a human being, ultimately only knew the most concise and intuitive way to speak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It would be the same even if you weren’t an idol.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A silence like having strongly struck the other person fell with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because there were many heart-dropping incidents today, I seemed to hear even the sound of the other person’s heart stopping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s eyes and the corners of his mouth distorted simultaneously. I felt like something was collapsing inside my heart. It was hard to watch, so I also squinted my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as his pupils shook here and there from shock, he had enough courtesy to remove his arm from me and step back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you going to Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon rapidly spat out the words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m shameless, but I think I also felt a bit betrayed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said you had no other feelings for me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m annoyed from the confusion. Like when I faced Agni.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you like Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t pry into everything. I don’t feel any reason to answer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That wasn’t the Jin Seol-woon I knew. Neither the original Jin Seol-woon nor the TV Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had completely lost his composure. Emotions preceded reason, his mind was a mess, and what he was thinking showed on his expression without filter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like me right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An expression mixing dissatisfaction and regret with himself, as if someone who’d lived excellently his whole life couldn’t accept this one moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly I thought I’d never looked at Jin Seol-woon’s face in such detail before. At a glance, he’s a handsome face, so what was this feeling like?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When my thoughts reached that point, the thorns that had been growing sharp enough to prick even myself instantly subsided. The strength drained out of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry. My tone was harsh just now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I lowered my tail first. Even prepared for that difficult question to surface again. Because this is right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had walked to stand against the wall, inhaled and exhaled several times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a short time passed and he turned his head, Jin Seol-woon’s eyes had become calm again like they usually were.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m sorry. I didn’t know what to do either… So, that is. My emotions got ahead of me. I was also sudden about it. The things I learned today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he was still rambling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He doesn’t like me that way. I don’t… either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, Jin Seol-woon stared at me for a long time as if he couldn’t believe it at all. However, he didn’t pursue anything further.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll go. Gang-hyeon-ssi is sick. Instead, later, please make time for me separately. …I’m saying give me a proper chance to speak too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the inside of his pupils still couldn’t shake off their turbidity, by the time he finished speaking, the Jin Seol-woon I knew had returned a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I obediently nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To soothe the shock, I ate a meal and took a 30-minute bath in the bathroom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Certainly, compared to before I dozed off in the training room, my body had clearly improved. I didn’t get dizzy even staying in hot water for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having stopped all thoughts, I entered work-from-home mode. I mechanically read and organized school documents. I received the documents from Sa Ye-ho who was in the office.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During this time, my phone kept ringing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Cooperate with me by today. First get your body completely better, then get angry.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I’ll wait.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I skimmed the honest texts with periods faithfully placed at the end of every sentence. I turned my eyes away pretending not to see and just read through documents continuously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Absentmindedly, I swept my lower lip with my tongue, then suddenly heat rushed to my face. Hissing, I quickly grabbed my phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Don’t let me see you]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then more than ten texts came flooding in saying I needed more treatment, sorry, and so on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should have told him to shut up too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But if what Jin Seol-woon said is true, and I’ll die if Ja Hyeong-woo doesn’t do that… thing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should have looked into it from when fusion skills required physical contact. It’s lamentable that I only realized it now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What remained for me as the price was a frail body that urgently needed treatment and a life debt owed to Ja Hyeong-woo…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …If I have to keep kissing someone, in the end I only have one choice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I had to do such things, there was ultimately only one person within the range I could endure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I picked up my phone. With a feeling equivalent to jumping off a cliff, I pressed three keys firmly. And sent it to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
