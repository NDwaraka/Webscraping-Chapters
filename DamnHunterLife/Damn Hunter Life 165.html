 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After dozing a little and waking up, my mind became clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The blanket I’d been covered with was neatly spread out. I kicked it with my feet to crumple it up like my room’s blanket should be, and looked around the room that was mine alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I looked down at my clothes. I was wearing a white t-shirt and pants that I didn’t even know I had.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t put them on myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened the closet and changed into my white sobok, my identity that I hadn’t worn in a long time. I erased the traces of Ja Hyeong-woo’s care one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t sleepy anymore and my head was completely clear. It was a signal that I was ready to return to normal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I roughly tied up my hair that was long enough to reach my shoulders. I turned on the desk lamp and sat down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I took out the original work notebook I’d hidden under the bookshelf. There were no traces that it had been discovered by Ja Hyeong-woo or the guys who had been coming in and out of this room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The notebook itself is top-secret information, but I’m not too worried about it leaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original content from before would just look like simple memos or a diary from the current perspective, since so much time has passed and I’ve messed up the dates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I read the notebook carefully from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The information notebook that had once been used to record original work information had changed from some page onward into a memo pad where I wrote down things I experienced directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From when I became leader, it was used as a notebook to research the successors’ skills and functions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had periodically undergone heterogeneous changes. Then I experienced upheaval in Stage 33.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the surface, I nearly died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But inside, where no one could know, something had changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {When the next sun rises, your victory.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t forget the voice of the spirit boss I heard in the middle of that burning hell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Have you ever heard a monster speak?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Probably not. There would be no point asking other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Maybe only I could hear it from the beginning.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The world inside gates is full of unknowns, and when you learn one thing, other unknowns arise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m gradually becoming distant from ordinary hunters. Even among fellow successors, I’m isolated alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I exhaled lightly and leaned back against the chair. Like when looking into other awakened ones, I focused on myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An incomparably clearer energy than before was circulating in my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I can’t express this with information from the original work or existing concepts from school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I organized the energy I possessed with new words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Mu (無/Void) attribute. An attribute that can accept anything or can accept nothing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was different from simply having no attribute. Something exists. That’s probably why the &lt;Boundary Between Life and Death&gt; skill doesn’t disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m close to spirit monsters, can touch soul stones, and have an extremely weakened body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, I break through awakened ones’ rules one by one and can directly touch the system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t prove anything with this right now…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at least I won’t create another situation where I collapse so painfully or can only hide team members underground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The existence of the final stage felt real, as if it were somewhere in the school. I could feel with my skin that the end was approaching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During that short time walking to the training ground, I heard students gasping fourteen times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Congratulations on your return!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Congratulations!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m really going crazy. What’s with saying thank you?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Which successor told them to do this? To salute when I pass by? Are they insane?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Students with moved tears welling in their eyes looked up at me admiringly. Some looked at me with complex eyes, then bowed their heads when our eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Many idiots deeply moved by Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Starting tomorrow I’ll borrow Sa Ye-ho’s clothes to wear. Throwing away the sobok.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d never been ashamed of being Gyeon Gang-hyeon no matter what curses I received, but now I’m embarrassed. I should at least wear a disguise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After experiencing this commotion even before entering the training ground, I was getting scared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Inside the group training ground, I peeked at the familiar figures from behind the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What should I say when I go in? Should I ask if training is going well and enter confidently? Ugh… It’s cringey. I’m going crazy from embarrassment.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I jumped at the voice from behind me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, wearing his sword, was standing with his arms crossed, looking at me hiding with interest. The front of his hunter uniform shirt was slightly wet with sweat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Uh…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sudden awkwardness rushed over me. I avoided his gaze for a moment, then gathered courage and faced Jin Seol-woon again, looking at his languid face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was worried.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A picture-perfect smile bloomed at Jin Seol-woon’s lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’d like to be alone with you a bit more… but we’ve already been caught.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon muttered while glancing over my shoulder. While I was turning around going “huh?”, Jin Seol-woon’s hand instantly stretched out beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang. Before I could do anything, he pushed the door open violently, making a sound. Jin Seol-woon pushed me forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The leader is here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was startled. The gazes that had already been gathering toward me turned into something like a herd of buffalo or rabbits at Jin Seol-woon’s shout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Starting with Hae Mi-jun, who hugged me tightly with thick teardrops hanging from his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo waited for his turn beside us, then hugged me as soon as Hae Mi-jun let go. His thick arms quickly released me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quite surprised by that expression, I said something disappointing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Disgusting, man.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Me too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, whose emotions had fled belatedly, looked disgusted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then when I looked behind, Sa Ye-ho was giggling while placing his hand on my shoulder. Jin Seol-woon, who was watching me quietly from a step behind, was a bonus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah really, ah. It was more comfortable when Woo Sae-geon was the leader. Really.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah walked over and spoke loudly as if for everyone to hear. She shook her head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I thought there was no peace of mind, I saw a small figure in front. I forgot everything I was thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s eyes were so sad. My heart stung as if I’d done something terribly wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t fathom Won Ha-ri’s feelings when she learned that her older brother had been hospitalized for a long time, and that I, whom she’d been projecting her brother onto, turned out to be in the same situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d hurt this sixteen-year-old too much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think my luck is pretty bad.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think so too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just laughed carelessly and agreed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t say anything special. Won Ha-ri spread her arms and hugged me tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gently placed my arms on Won Ha-ri’s back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The recovery period was almost over now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I wake up tomorrow, I’ll go to the office first, gradually join training, and slowly get my condition back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat on the bed and glared at the doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You go home too. Stop staying over.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who hadn’t been at the training ground, had been sulking at my house all this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to secure my territory. These past few days were special, but I can’t let him come and go from here like his own house normally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that happens, that bastard will think of it as cohabitation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Nothing you forgot?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While he was looking at me like “what am I supposed to do,” he immediately followed up with:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang energy treatment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At those words, my neck stiffened as if I’d been hit in the back of the head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait, hey. Do you want to do that to a sick person?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You just said you were all better.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that what you call logic?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo pulled himself closer to me. Flustered by the close distance, I tried to stop him with words since I couldn’t be the only one flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just a little. I’ll do it gently.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But our lips were already overlapping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere in the room was very still. Unusually, Ja Hyeong-woo barely moved even while kissing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He who carefully pressed his lips to mine savored the faint vibration. Exchanging breaths, he lightly held flesh between his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can hear a pounding sound. It’s not me—Ja Hyeong-woo’s heart is beating too loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before tenderness, pure excitement travels through the hand cupping my cheek, seeping from trembling lips. I felt like I might become strange too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The lips separated with a soft sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my closed eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Feel better?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo whispered near my lips with our foreheads touching.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The touching eyelashes tickled, making me frown first. I subtly avoided his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You could heal with just this much, you bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was all that stuff you did before then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Feeling guilty, Ja Hyeong-woo avoided my gaze. Still, his hand remained on top of my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can you really sleep alone?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you want to get seriously cursed out and leave, or just leave?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gave Ja Hyeong-woo the finger. Ja Hyeong-woo saw that and still smiled slightly as he left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I made a big show of falling asleep alone…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I didn’t sleep properly. I woke up in the middle of the night as if someone had forcibly dragged me out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not even a few seconds passed before I bolted upright.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without much thought, I burst out of the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not far away, a small figure of a person had collapsed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The strange feeling I just had must have been sensing this kid’s energy. When I hurriedly tapped his shoulder, the boy woke up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not a student at this school.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More precisely, he wasn’t a student until just a few minutes ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The child looked slightly younger and smaller than fifteen, the school’s minimum age requirement. His dazed focus immediately fixed on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s your name?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jeong I-ryeong…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wrapped the boy, who looked cold, in spare clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t even need to check the system. I could see the boy’s identity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Starting tomorrow, the name you’ll use is Beom I-ryeong.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
