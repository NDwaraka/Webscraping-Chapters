  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 167
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Going to the cafeteria would obviously draw attention to Beom I-ryeong. So I headed to my house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong already went and sat familiarly at my house’s dining table. He even helped me move the dishes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how I look at him, he’s really well-behaved. He looks like a doll too. On top of that, his dining etiquette was perfect. This is my first time with a guy like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I secretly watched Beom I-ryeong as he quietly swallowed his food.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘His mental state seems fine and everything looks okay, but he talks too little, which is a bit concerning. Maybe that’s just his personality.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as we finished eating, I went into Hunter School’s shop and checked how much of the Tiger successor’s house had been built. The progress had almost reached 100%.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll go to the bathroom for a bit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okay.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Beom I-ryeong left, my phone rang. It was a call from Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I heard I-ryeong succeeded in manifesting his attribute?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It hadn’t even been a few hours, but news of Beom I-ryeong’s training results had already spread to all the successors. It probably went from Myo Cho-hui to Ma Cheon-ah, then from Ma Cheon-ah to everyone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successor network is quite active now too. They play, eat, and do everything together even without me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I-ryeong is really amazing. That’s great!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun gave sincere praise over the phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at Beom I-ryeong might remind him of his past self, but rather than showing inferiority, he offered pure congratulations. That kind heart came through completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s better than me, really. The world turns because of you.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, Won Ha-ri also called. Why are you calling too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Don’t make me train together with him, okay?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wondered what this was about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri, who has trauma(?) about joint training, suddenly clung to me. I chuckled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not a newbie anymore, why worry about that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Oh, right. Anyway! I’ll work harder. I’ll be more useful.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t burn with competitive spirit against your junior.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I smiled quietly and casually turned around, but a boy in white clothes was standing right in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My spine felt eerie for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong has no presence and is quiet, so I didn’t know he was behind me. Did he hear what I was saying?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Well, I might talk about him a bit. After hanging up, I soon relaxed my posture again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your quarters are finished now too. Go there and customize it according to the school shop’s guide. You can live alone, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…No. I’m scared.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong’s eyes as he muttered that were utterly dry. I frowned slightly at the strangeness I could vaguely sense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please let me stay with hyung-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s how it turned out. Don’t come to my house at night anymore.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a bolt from the blue announcement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if he looks mature, he’s still a kid. Maybe it’s because I’m the first person he met after falling into the school. I guess I’m the most comfortable to him. I’m going to keep him at my house for a while, then send him out when he adapts.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The round, non-sharp tone couldn’t comfort Ja Hyeong-woo either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it weren’t for what Gyeon Gang-hyeon said next, he would have felt like the world was collapsing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Treat…ment will be done during the day in the office. Just briefly. When Sa Ye-ho isn’t there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The point was that there absolutely couldn’t be any hint about what he and Ja Hyeong-woo were doing to the young successors. (His face turned bright red when saying this.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If it’s because I-ryeong is at your house, you could come to my house to do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. My schedule is all set during the day. Even with teleportation, I only have 30 minutes free.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo actually had the desire for the whole world to know what kind of relationship he and Gang-hyeon had, but Gyeon Gang-hyeon strongly avoided it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then at night at my house…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have to watch the kid at home. Leave a child alone at night?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he tried being clingy, Gyeon Gang-hyeon slipped away from his hands like sand grains. Left alone, Ja Hyeong-woo felt a gnawing hunger like someone who had starved for an entire day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At least he didn’t say to eliminate meeting time altogether…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At Ja Hyeong-woo’s feet standing in the training ground, a sensation like damp water pooling arises.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Water thoroughly soaks his feet, then climbs up his ankles to pull him down. It’s wariness close to anxiety.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though there’s nothing in front to glare at, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes sharpen fiercely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That guy’s expression is nasty again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The owner of a slightly husky voice compared to his smooth features appeared smoothly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho clicked his tongue and positioned himself against the wall opposite Ja Hyeong-woo. Ja Hyeong-woo got straight to the point as if he’d been waiting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t like Beom I-ryeong. It seems like he’s hiding something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s expression was ambiguous. From the start, the two weren’t close enough to readily believe what each other said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Evidence?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “None. It’s intuition.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the reason was absurd. Sa Ye-ho swept his hair behind his ear once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re so confident, why don’t you go consult with Gyeon Gang-hyeon? Why are you telling me and making a fuss?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stared intently at Sa Ye-ho’s grumbling face. If he directly told Gang-hyeon that he suspected Beom I-ryeong…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He might say I’m making false accusations out of jealousy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you two still like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo glared at him fiercely, meaning don’t act like you know. Soon he dropped his eyes down again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…That’s one reason, but it would be troublesome if words without evidence reached Beom I-ryeong’s ears.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Still, there should be at least some reason. If it’s not just jealousy over losing Gyeon Gang-hyeon, as you say.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The answer to that took some time even for Ja Hyeong-woo. After choosing his words for a while, Ja Hyeong-woo slowly raised his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “His soul is unclear. Hard to see.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What bullshit? Did you eat something wrong? Sa Ye-ho said with his expression. Ja Hyeong-woo corrected himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m saying he doesn’t seem like an ordinary kid.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho recalled the face of Beom I-ryeong, whom he’d only passed by or briefly met a few times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because he’s unfamiliar, he seriously lacked social skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Myo Cho-hui noona directly guided his training but didn’t say anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Sa Ye-ho also…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I do think he’s not childlike.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If pressed, there was a sense of incongruity in personality aspects. After recalling Beom I-ryeong, whose ego seemed blurred, Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression of ‘no soul’ became somewhat understandable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually Sa Ye-ho replied with a slight snort mixed in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine. Either you or I will definitely be nearby. If circumstances don’t allow it, at least we’ll know his location.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was ultimately also on the side of protecting Gyeon Gang-hyeon. And this kind of caution could never be too much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The small-framed boy suddenly opened his eyes on the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before his eyes, the scene of Ja Hyeong-woo talking with Sa Ye-ho was clearly visible. As if they had surveillance cameras attached to them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong heard all the conversation they had.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This stage’s appearing monsters were estimated to be wood attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a perfect place for Won Ha-ri, the natural enemy of wood, to go in and wreak havoc. So I put Won Ha-ri as first priority, and while choosing which successor to exclude, I let out a small sigh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like I had much more leeway than last time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s fortunate that Beom I-ryeong appeared.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw the number 10 for the first time in a while. It was a number where everyone up to the personnel limit could enter and still leave three reserve successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides the comfort that simply increased numbers give, the advantages Beom I-ryeong provides are significant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even considering that growth is fast in the early stages, that guy’s results were amazing. His stats increased meaningfully with just basic physical training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, the boldness of not being particularly scared even when facing Ja Hyeong-woo, who’s about three times his size.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If trained well, Beom I-ryeong could become an excellent successor. These days I go to the training ground for the fun of raising that guy’s stats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait well until I come back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Have a safe trip.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I stepped into the stage, my thoughts returned to reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To call it ‘reality,’ this stage filled with lush landscaping is more unrealistic though.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri walked briskly forward in front of me. Fluttering her black and white skirt, she drew her sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Up to here, the pattern would be the same as the previous Jangsan Tiger stage, but Won Ha-ri had prepared one more thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind Won Ha-ri, a smooth silver spirit appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was tall, had a round head, and a thin, long curled tail. And above all, it stood on two legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first metal attribute familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had been months since Won Ha-ri manifested her monkey familiar, but it was unstable so she hadn’t properly brought it out until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But starting from when I nearly died and came back, Won Ha-ri became able to properly maintain her energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s something to be grateful and happy about… but I feel responsible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Sorry. For making you work hard after seeing me in a near-death state.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I remember when the monkey familiar first appeared. We were all expecting a comical appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But, they say the evolutionary point of primates is bipedal locomotion. They say the remaining two feet became hands that could handle tools.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment a large monkey appeared holding a sword handle as long as its body, all laughter disappeared from us.
