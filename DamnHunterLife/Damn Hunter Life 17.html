<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Esi didn’t show his face in the video. The recording video only showed a design background created by the agency’s editing team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But his voice alone was enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —You mean everything in me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Esi sang a song by a pop singer who had dominated the indie music scene in the 2000s, arranging it in his own way. With that one song, he drew praise from both fans and the general public.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Just give me a chance, I never disappoint you.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t a depth that a mere 20-year-old should be able to contain. Fans said this about Esi. Esi would be main vocalist material in other groups, but because he was young and the leader hyung was even better, he became the lead vocalist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though his default expression was blank, fans highly valued that faint smile he occasionally showed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who realized how much fans welcomed him, was surprisingly moved in another way as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This memory goes back to before he even recorded the cover video.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  &lt;Hunter School Shop&gt;
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Would you like to construct a recording booth?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Insufficient points.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shop could make anything, but the more high-tech the facility, the more points it cost. Jin Seol-woon, who had tried to install a recording booth using the Hunter School shop’s power, faced a financial problem.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Want me to lend you some? I don’t have anywhere to spend points anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His Twelve Zodiac colleagues were the first to extend their hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was obviously a facility that would interfere with training, and it would have been reasonable for them to look unfavorably upon it, but surprisingly, they all accepted it positively. Thanks to the points they pooled together bit by bit, he was able to meet the amount.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Woo Sae-geon, the Twelve Zodiac’s leader who had never smiled in front of others, had an impressive reaction for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he didn’t give even 1 point, at least he didn’t curse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did it have to be right before Stage 26?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It ended with this level of reproach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So on the day the recording booth was completed, Jin Seol-woon inevitably encountered Gyeon Gang-hyeon in front of his house as usual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to listen to the song too, you know? I told you I’m your fan.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How many times is that the same bullshit?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though profanity finally came out of Jin Seol-woon’s mouth, Gyeon Gang-hyeon wiggled his straight eyebrows and responded with an amused face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m a dog, so I talk bullshit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It really was bullshit. In the end, Jin Seol-woon gave up early and let him into the recording booth. Gyeon Gang-hyeon sat down quite naturally with an attitude like it was obvious, and looked around inside the glass.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having prepared a recording booth, he didn’t want to delay any longer, so Jin Seol-woon just started his first sound quality check with Gyeon Gang-hyeon right in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who became instantly absorbed, returned to the past through the microphone in front of his face. At this moment, he forgot all about being the Dragon successor and training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The time when he sang with the heart to captivate someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even before that, the time when he was simply happy if he could just sing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had a smile on his lips, had become accustomed to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s presence outside the booth before he knew it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It didn’t seem bad to have someone listen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoever that person was, he would sing with the thought of making them his fan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After one song ended, Jin Seol-woon and Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been sitting delinquently on the chair, raised one corner of his mouth. That image stuck particularly long in Jin Seol-woon’s mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon had to admit once again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The method was annoying, but if it hadn’t been for Gyeon Gang-hyeon…… I wouldn’t have been able to reclaim what was mine this quickly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the cover was just one video, it quickly rose to the trending list. Subscription notifications poured in to the SNS account that had lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers due to inactivity on Jin Seol-woon’s phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How strange. He was excited like the day he first debuted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While coming out of the recording booth, Jin Seol-woon unconsciously rolled up his shirt sleeves in front of Gyeon Gang-hyeon while wiping off sweat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s gaze fixed on Jin Seol-woon’s bare arm that still had blue and green marks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That still hasn’t healed?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Startled, he hurriedly pulled his sleeves back down to hide the wound. He turned around without responding, but Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mind was already turning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I think Hae Mi-jun could fix that if he strengthened his skills.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s just that Ja Hyeong-woo doesn’t have skills for recovering from poison-type injuries. For an idol to have scars remaining in such a visible place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But if I make Hae Mi-jun and Jin Seol-woon meet here, it might be exposed what I’ve been doing around school.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been worrying, just decided to contact Hae Mi-jun. As always, Hae Mi-jun answered within 5 seconds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes, hyung! Did you get another schedule during our training time tomorrow?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do I always change the time? It’s a different story, but I’ve been meeting with Jin Seol-woon lately.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Seol-woon-nim?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just call him hyung. Anyway, I’m trying to get some Earth attribute weapons.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was wrong to leave an idol’s arm like that, he took the risk and told Hae Mi-jun to meet Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t say I told you to do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes? Yes.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was overflowing with willingness to keep anything Gyeon Gang-hyeon instructed without question or argument.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You watch Stage strategy videos anyway, right? Ask if all the injuries he got there have healed, and say you’ve gained skills recently and would like to heal him.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes, I’ll keep that in mind.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who was thinking if there was anything else to instruct, suddenly showed amusement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It would be good if this gradually creates grounds for you to join the Twelve Zodiac strategy team.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Whaaat? I, I still don’t have the skills for that…….”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun couldn’t easily imagine himself weaving between monsters like Ja Hyeong-woo and throwing heal skills to tankers and dealers. He was scared first. So he stuttered and waved his hands in denial.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After hanging up the phone, his pounding heart wouldn’t calm down, so he took deep breaths for a while. He thought it was ridiculous, but still.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Since Gang-hyeon hyung says I can do it, strangely, I think it might be possible……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Current Hae Mi-jun didn’t know well that that day would be closer than expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun briefly thought of Gang-hyeon hyung in a daze, then shook his head and focused on the task he was given again. Even while initiating a one-on-one successor chat with Jin Seol-woon, he was nervous again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s a pity. I have to keep Gang-hyeon hyung a secret.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I want to talk with Seol-woon-nim, no, Seol-woon hyung.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That Gang-hyeon hyung has changed. This recording booth, did you perhaps get help from Gang-hyeon hyung?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be nice if there was someone to share this overwhelming feeling that the world changed thanks to Gang-hyeon hyung.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Make me just one earth weapon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s problem was all resolved, but I still had a problem remaining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Really, for the very last time, I barged into Jin Seol-woon’s house and lay sprawled on the hallway floor. So Jin Seol-woon couldn’t pass.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you do this for me, I won’t bother you anymore.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally revealing my purpose to the person involved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought he’d be angry that I’d been scheming for this reason, but Jin Seol-woon was calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, he’d already noticed. That I was moving with some kind of ulterior motive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon gazed at me quietly with a blunt face, just like he had on the day we first met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to take sword classes but I can’t make attribute weapons. Do it. Do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon still had an expressionless face but. Eventually he nodded. Then he lifted me up and kicked me out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come at this time tomorrow. Using Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s specialty ‘sneaking around.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Okay, I got the promise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t care how Jin Seol-woon sees me. Whether he sees me as a self-destructive piece of trash or whatever, it’s all fine as long as I get a proper weapon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That should be a somewhat usable weapon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah shit, he’s not giving me a D-rank weapon, is he? It just has an attribute attached, but if that’s the case, a kitchen knife would be better?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I became rapidly anxious. The scenes of me tormenting Jin Seol-woon flashed by like a panorama.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Harboring uneasiness, when I visited the next day, Jin Seol-woon was standing with his long legs propped against the inner front door of his house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was checking civilian community reactions on his phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, can’t you not look at that? Just look at your SNS and Innate fan cafe?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I, who have an allergy to Twelve Zodiac communities, frowned first. Jin Seol-woon ignored me and scrolled down steadily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……It’s amazing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What is.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There aren’t even Innate fans here, but there’s almost no criticism about me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I had checked a bit in advance too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From nutritionless posts like ‘Right, he was an idol;; I just thought he was handsome,’ to provocations at the level of ‘Is he training properly?’ there were some, but overall it was a level of reaction that Jin Seol-woon could think was okay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stage 26 isn’t far away either. I was prepared for comments calling me reckless.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Standing side by side, my height was much shorter than Jin Seol-woon’s. While trying not to be conscious of that, I glared at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You really can’t be objective about yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you mean?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because you’re a good person.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon took his eyes off the screen and met mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re a hunter who’s never disappointed the nation. Is that all? When you were a singer, you had no controversies, and even if you don’t talk much or show expressions, you’re sincere with fan service. You’re young but skilled. Weren’t you also learning composition?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……You searched, didn’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you I’m a fan?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon shook his head. Look at this guy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before I could snap back, Jin Seol-woon appropriately diverted my attention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Here. The weapon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon suddenly gripped my hand tightly. His grip, hardened from holding swords, completely covered my hand as a fellow man.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Item transfer from inventory to inventory is possible only with contacted parties. Soon, a ding notification sound came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without giving me time to check, Jin Seol-woon immediately pushed away from the wall. Then he opened the door and left first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come out a little later so you don’t get caught on camera. Don’t think about sneaking into the house and stealing things like a thief again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, I don’t have any more reason to do that, you know? I have no reason to come to your house!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard is now putting me down with a blank face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just said out of irritation that I had no reason to come to Jin Seol-woon’s house, but actually, there might be exactly one more time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If this weapon Jin Seol-woon gave me is trash-tier?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wait, let me prepare fully before summoning.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sword Jin Seol-woon made might be too heavy, so the moment it’s summoned in basic state gripped in my right hand, my wrist might go crack! and break.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, after putting my hand down on the floor, the status window was looking down pitifully at me trembling in fear as I tried to summon.
 </span>

  Unidentified object in inventory, open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A thin-bladed sword with a cool light appeared. My eyes widened at its extraordinary appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It looked like a twin of the hunter weapon Jin Seol-woon uses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘First, the appearance passes. What’s the grade? B-rank?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was completely stunned by the alphabet that appeared on the status window afterward.

  Top grade? Why is he giving me this when I’m trash like me? Something that each successor can only make 1-2 of?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How much of his ability did Jin Seol-woon dedicate to making this? He didn’t show any signs earlier?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I feel like I’ve been hit in the back of the head, no, like I’ve been surprised. Unable to contain my shock, I gently gripped the handle with my soft right hand. Supporting my wrist with the opposite hand, I tried lifting it up—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why is it so light?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was as light as aluminum, as if considering the weak user. It was light enough that I could swing it around with one hand, so that says it all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at the status window again, I was stunned for the third time.
