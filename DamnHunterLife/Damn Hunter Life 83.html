  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 83

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it had been the delinquent Gang-hyeon, they expected him to get angry and refuse to answer at this point. But their expectations were beautifully off the mark. Another masterpiece appeared before Hong Jeong-hyeok and the PD team’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“If you had to be washed by someone? Successor Gang-hyeon, can you answer!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon clenched both fists tightly, almost on the verge of tears, struggling desperately to give an answer somehow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an absolutely magnificent expression. He’d never made such a tearful face even when hurt during combat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  PD Hong Jeong-hyeok gulped. Once again, narration and subtitles he wanted to add immediately came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Narration: Pondering with tears in his eyes…]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His choice was Hae Mi-jun. Mi-jun’s face turned bright red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Mi-jun’s reaction, being the epitome of innocence, ended up becoming pure evil that tormented Gang-hyeon to the very end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Narration: Moved to tears]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Mi-jun): Thank you… I’ll do my absolute best for you]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Narration: Horrified]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Gang-hyeon): Don’t try your best!]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hong Jeong-hyeok savored the satisfaction rising within him as he watched the question corner come to an end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is what makes being a PD for talk shows worthwhile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After filming ended, the writers also happily entered the editing meeting. All those worries about scandals seemed pointless now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon alone had completely changed the atmosphere. He wasn’t a problem—he was a blessing!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though they seemed to harbor some vain hopes too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we edit Gang-hyeon successor’s parts just a little bit, really just a tiny bit provocatively?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Push him as a character who gets ruined?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s weak so there’s no possibility of him rising as a combatant later, so it should be fine, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we try persuading the CEO once…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at the results alone, the writers would be disappointed in the near future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The cause originated from an entertainment building dozens of kilometers away from the broadcasting company building where they were.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. Please make sure to take care of Gang-hyeon’s image.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dragon Successor Jin Seol-woon had heard about the talk show through connections from a friendly producer at his agency. He requested that his words be conveyed to &lt;The Hero&gt; broadcast team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was a talk show cast member, a hero, and an idol. Jin Seol-woon had faith that what he said would naturally be carried out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Don’t you have no connection?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not like there’s none.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to his ambiguous response, the other person didn’t understand immediately and tilted their head in confusion. Soon they asked subtly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Is it because of that sword? Did you really give it to Successor Gang-hyeon?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who knows.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ah come on, Seol-woon. Give me a clear answer. I’ll keep it to myself.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t just him who was frustrated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire nation had been curious for months since the truth about the sword hadn’t been clearly revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whenever questions came up on talk shows, Jin Seol-woon had always evaded with appropriate answers that were neither here nor there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That sword doesn’t have a particularly special design, does it? I also made mine copying a sword I’d seen somewhere.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since it’s a weapon used in combat… could we say that answer is confidential?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he wouldn’t clarify it himself, these two opinions—[Jin Seol-woon really made it for him/Gang-hyeon just copied it]—couldn’t tip toward either side and could only clash tensely against each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon just smiled. In the end, his acquaintance producer had no choice but to end the call without any gains.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today there was something he needed to report to the leader. While stopping by the communal training ground to talk to Woo Sae-geon about skill changes, Jin Seol-woon also slipped into the earth attribute training ground where he was originally supposed to be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a place he didn’t come to unless he was temporarily doing pair training with Gang-hyeon. Because he wasn’t interested.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The usual training ground scenery came into view. As soon as he spotted someone sitting alone in the center, Jin Seol-woon’s eyes lit up with amusement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, what kind of acrostic poem is this!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he was clearly alone, he was that noisy. His phone partner was probably Sa Ye-ho, who was streaming a broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is that person always butting in everywhere…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Jin Seol-woon walked over and stood right behind him, Gang-hyeon didn’t notice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was busy being harassed for acrostic poems by Sa Ye-ho, who was obsessed with broadcast content. Jin Seol-woon didn’t reveal his presence and quietly eavesdropped on the call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Mu!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho energetically gave the first syllable of the acrostic poem.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mu-gi-reul (weapon) wherever I got it from.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gi!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gi-kkal-na-ge (awesomely) I’m using it well now, so why does that matter?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Chul!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Chul… Chul-sin-ji-ga (origin) wherever it is, why are you guys…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Cheo!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cheo-gung-geum-hae-ha-go (curious about it) making such a fuss!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For being ambushed, it wasn’t bad quick thinking. He showed off his temper quite well, and properly delivered his threat to stop mentioning that damn weapon. Sa Ye-ho’s laughter burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Kuhaha, hey that was good, that was good. As expected, our puppy.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, that sword has nothing to do with Successor Jin Seol-woon, and I made it copying his! Because it looked cool. That’s the end. The end!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon seemed to want the story about that S-grade sword to stop being talked about. He loudly and angrily let statements flow on the broadcast that his sword had nothing to do with Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing that Jin Seol-woon was listening right above his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Lies.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon froze completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho in the phone went “Eh? Who’s that?” in confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Sa Ye-ho could hear it, that meant viewers watching the broadcast could hear it clearly too. Jin Seol-woon was certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon he bent his waist deeply and tilted his head. The place his lips approached was the phone, just a little away from Gang-hyeon’s cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually, I did make it for him. Viewers.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Outside the official Twelve Zodiac community, countless stories circulated through various social media.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immersing themselves in fandom and boldly creating stories was both the pleasure and culture of that place. And among them, naturally, there were those who shipped successors as CP (couples).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But our kids have an implicit dating ban because they have to fight… Yang Pyo and Ma Cheon-ah are special cases.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, they dug into male-male couples that had relatively low chances of existing in reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For example, Sa Ye-ho had the most colorful couplings. Since he was originally an octopus who got around everywhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, Woo Sae-geon had almost none except being paired with Sa Ye-ho in the shadows, but in conclusion, there were some. Even the Twelve Zodiac leader couldn’t escape in the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even amid all this, there was one person who avoided all the fans’ CP pairings as an untouchable sacred territory…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dragon Successor Jin Seol-woon, otherwise known as current idol Innate’s lead vocalist—stage name Esi.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The existence of Innate, which he originally belonged to, was too strong, and he himself didn’t create any points of contact worth shipping with the Twelve Zodiac successors. Even while going through stages where colleagues had to have each other’s backs, he had approached everything businesslike.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, recently there had been some changes in his relationship chart.
 </span>
</p>

  Video3: Sa Ye-ho’s July 3rd broadcast but Gang-hyeon’s sword was really made by Jin Seol-woon;; all the kids who said it wasn’t come out
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People talking about the so-called ‘Jin Seol-woon × Gang-hyeon’ had emerged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Jin Seol-woon’s first CP within the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was also delinquent successor Gang-hyeon’s third CP. Originally ‘Ja Hyeong-woo Gang-hyeon’ had been the main one, and ‘Sa Ye-ho Gang-hyeon’ had been a minor sub feeling, but Jin Seol-woon was newly added here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People who had discovered a new taste excitedly chatted with like-minded social media friends. Some even spread stories on public accounts. As if no one but themselves would see these stories.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, as public accounts tend to be, these could actually be carried anywhere via algorithms or searches, and anyone could see them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fingers wearing a sparkling silver ring scrolled down, reading the search results for ‘Jin Seol-woon Gang-hyeon’. Large eyes gloomily reflected the screen light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His real name was Dodam.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unlike Jin Seol-woon, his real name was also his stage name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Innate’s lead rapper, who had a baby-like and cheerful appearance as his name suggested, but with the twist of specializing in rough, powerful rap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he was the youngest member beloved by everyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though there was only a one-year difference, he even acted spoiled toward Esi, who unlike himself was born with a mature atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Esi hyung, let’s just hold out for one more year… Graduate with me. Hm? My hyung being an adult while leaving me out…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Innate’s youngest line was especially close. Having attended the same high school and run schedules together during their debut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I already miss hyung… Sob…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Esi had to leave Innate to become a hunter, Dodam ended up wailing loudly while doing a farewell broadcast in front of fans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From that day, Dodam watched Esi hyung’s new life with a heart full of worry, and on the other hand, with strange disappointment and loneliness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Mi-jun-ssi. It’s dangerous so please step back a little!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while biting his nails in anxiety that even one scratch might appear on hyung’s body…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, I’m the only one Esi hyung speaks informally to. I was worried because Successor Hae Mi-jun seemed a bit similar to me in feeling.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dodam kept checking and double-checking. Watching Jin Seol-woon maintain distance from everyone, he found a strange sense of security.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon feels awkward when he’s with the successors. His place is with Innate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dodam’s faith cracked a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Esi hyung has a coupling with someone other than our members…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The familiar face captured on the talk broadcast looked at Gang-hyeon sitting next to him. Dodam couldn’t take his eyes off that scene for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is it true that physical closeness beats emotional closeness in the end?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Esi’s top priority should be Innate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I feel like Esi hyung is going to leave us.’
 </span>
</p>
