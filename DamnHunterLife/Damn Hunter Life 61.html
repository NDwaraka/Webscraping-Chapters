  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 61
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And so, Jin Seol-woon took the seat to my right on the talk show, while my left side was still empty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there… no seat?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the cautious voice, I turned to see a light blue nangdo robe there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps nervous about the broadcast, Hae Mi-jun’s face had already turned beet red even before we started, and he quietly pulled out the chair next to me. As he did so, the chair moved a bit closer in my direction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This will throw off the symmetry on both sides, won’t it?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to tell Hae Mi-jun when Jin Seol-woon suddenly turned to look at Hae Mi-jun, making me miss my timing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun-ssi, would you like to put something on your lips too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, yes. I understand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “To be honest, since you’re sitting next to Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, I think you should pay extra attention.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, you’re right… Gang-hyeon hyung is really, really handsome.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What kind of conversation is this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon leaned his elbow on my table and gestured for Hae Mi-jun to come closer. Hae Mi-jun quickly leaned his face forward. Since I was sandwiched between them, Hae Mi-jun’s upper body touched mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What are you two trying to do in front of me? One of you should get up and go over there.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m always the easy target, aren’t I.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, the remaining seats were gradually filled. Perhaps for audio balance, Myo Cho-hui, who had a lively concept, sat next to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, Ma Cheon-ah, and Won Ha-ri’s seats were three chairs lined up next to Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Alright, let’s start recording—!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind the host’s refreshing voice, a red light came on at the top of the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The official broadcast “The Heroes.” A show that covers the new sides that hunters—successors who protect South Korea—show in private settings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It featured personal stories that fans would go crazy for, like hobbies and past histories, or dealt with hot topics currently trending in communities. They also played games occasionally. Physical games like arm wrestling, or quizzes done comedically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“There are no games today! We’re too busy just looking at successor Won Ha-ri and successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s faces!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m saved, thank heavens.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wasn’t ready to embarrass myself doing thigh wrestling or something with Won Ha-ri, who’s still a 15-year-old female student.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Originally, they would have talked about the new successors and had the host mention mine and Won Ha-ri’s stats to turn mine into a laughing point.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But talk shows can’t discuss hunters’ actual stats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time the talk topics and order were conveyed, Woo Sae-geon crossed them out without fail.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who’s superior and who’s lacking… to prevent such issues from becoming official statements when spoken aloud by the parties involved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Today’s topic is… alcohol tolerance?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But another problem came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon hadn’t removed this topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The host probably won’t ask me about my alcohol tolerance since they wouldn’t openly put me in a difficult position, but just having this topic come up is problematic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’ll probably be brought up again in communities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s past wrongs of drinking and tormenting students.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, before the questions, let me address this one thing. We’ve decided not to know Gang-hyeon’s alcohol tolerance! Our Gang-puppy and I agreed to quit drinking together.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But unexpectedly, Sa Ye-ho gathered attention with his booming voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The camera automatically turned this way and blinked to capture my reaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When did I ever agree with you—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said I could drink all your alcohol for you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, that’s because you don’t have enough alcohol to drink yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that Sa Ye-ho was quite a heavy drinker was fairly common knowledge among Sa Ye-ho’s viewers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then let’s see the evidence video!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho suddenly raised his hand and shouted, then sat back down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This way, during the broadcast, a video will be inserted after my comment and aired.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What video.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You and me at the convenience store before.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah. That one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The video where I saw the fake chat and mentioned regretting my past drinking life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s right. I think I was pathetic myself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had been saving this for a reason. He planned to air it together with this broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Our Ye-ho had it all planned out. A plan to cover for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked at Sa Ye-ho with emotion. Hot gazes were exchanged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You bastard. Thank you.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you’re grateful, keep quitting alcohol from now on. Don’t embarrass me~.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the question about alcohol tolerance came to Jin Seol-woon, the host was particularly respectful to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Jin Seol-woon was a famous idol before being a successor, it was natural if you think about it. He was even a top-tier idol with solid agency care. It would be trouble if they carelessly asked questions and damaged his image, only to receive complaints from his agency. Like a prince, you could say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t like alcohol. It’s bitter. Unless it’s a situation where I absolutely must drink, I tend not to drink.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“How unexpected! Don’t you get told you’re cute by your fans?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A little.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then why did you drink beer with me in that field?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Oh my, this question must be boring for successors who can’t drink alcohol yet! Then let me change the question a bit here. Successor Won Ha-ri, question! When you become an adult later, who would you like to learn drinking from?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyone except Gang-hyeon oppa would be fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m really just everyone’s punching bag.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I made a grumpy face and rested my chin on my hand. It was an expression I deliberately made to be caught on camera. Since I was doing it anyway, I even grumbled out loud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Huh? Successor Won Ha-ri. You said ‘so-and-so-nim’ to the other people, but just now you seemed to call successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon ‘oppa’? Am I imagining this?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A light blush appeared on Won Ha-ri’s cheeks. She looked very flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ga, Gang-hyeon oppa isn’t someone you can call ‘nim’!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Haha. I understand.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now that the word ‘oppa’ came up, I’m reminded that there are hardly any same-age peers among the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The 22-year-olds Ja Hyeong-woo—Sa Ye-ho—Gyeon Gang-hyeon are the only ones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Ja Hyeong-woo had not even a speck of interest in Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon had the potential to be the bridge connecting the two and the main component of same-age chemistry… but before people could even grasp the existence of the same-age trio, the original Gyeon Gang-hyeon failed to awaken, and Gyeon Gang-hyeon became known as an unawakened drunk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And that’s still the same now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throughout the talk show, Ja Hyeong-woo and I barely even made eye contact, pretending not to know each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The next topic is… I got this with difficulty! Our successors were so cute when they were young! Your childhood photos were sent by your parents!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo and Ma Cheon-ah, who happened to be sitting next to each other and had been fighting throughout the talk show, were horrified. Only at times like this were they a pair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was a topic that wasn’t in the script given beforehand. This kind of surprise was probably the whole point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Haha, why are you surprised! Whose photo will be first? Here we go! Receive the photo!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Parent-selected past photos are usually embarrassing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m the same, but I had something to rely on, so I was relaxed. Enough to just watch the other guys’ faces turn red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Kyaa, successor Myo Cho-hui! So cute!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I object to that photo—!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Overruled.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s joke that Myo Cho-hui jumping up to interrupt was like a prosecutor in court made several people chuckle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ah, unfortunately we couldn’t obtain successor Woo Sae-geon’s photo.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wonder if they really couldn’t get it, or if they deliberately left it out to maintain Woo Sae-geon’s tyrant image.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aw, I wanted to see it! He’s such a tough one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho lightly poked Woo Sae-geon, who was sitting with his arms crossed and eyes closed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“And… unfortunately we also couldn’t obtain successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s photo.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expected this. The host didn’t bother explaining the reason, and I just passed it off with a nonchalant expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “My photos are really expensive.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just made one cheeky comment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, when I had been possessing this body for a few days, based on what I found out through the phone and manager…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed Gyeon Gang-hyeon had lost his parents one after another during middle and high school. There didn’t seem to be any relatives he kept in touch with either. So there would have been no place to get photos from.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Then the last photo would be successor Ja Hyeong-woo’s? Let me see… Gasp! Oh my… This is big.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The host reacted with surprise, then soon began grinning while looking at the small photo in his hand alone, perhaps to arouse viewers’ curiosity. His face was plastered with excitement and interest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This photo was given directly by successor Ja Hyeong-woo’s parents—!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The photo appeared large on our screen too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eek!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strange scream burst from my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I jumped up so suddenly that my chair rattled as it was pushed back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Uh… Apart from Hae Mi-jun making a dumbfounded sound next to me in surprise, I couldn’t see anything around me. Only that photo, because of that photo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The background appeared to be the entrance to a mountain. There was Ja Hyeong-woo from that time, small with chubby cheeks. He looked to be elementary school age. His face was quite different from his disgusting current self, yet somehow his impression was exactly the same.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Ja Hyeong-woo was carrying someone on his back, looking at the camera lens. Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression was gentle and bright. Along with another kid whose legs were stretched out to both sides from behind and whose head was tilted to the side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t help but recognize him. That pale face was… young Gyeon Gang-hyeon. He was making a V with his hands like horns above Ja Hyeong-woo’s head and smiling brightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Crazy broadcast. There was a reason they saved Ja Hyeong-woo’s photo for last!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, damn it, I reacted too strongly. They definitely won’t edit this part out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the real ambush was what came next.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Ja Hyeong-woo, have you seen this photo before!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips, staring intently up at the photo, finally continue speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s in the drawer of my room at my family home.”
 </span>
</p>
