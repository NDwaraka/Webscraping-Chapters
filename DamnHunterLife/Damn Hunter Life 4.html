  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 4
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo grabbed my dirt-covered arm and lifted me up with a jerk. I dangled half in the air before being plopped down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately, something blue touched my forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A staff with a butterfly-shaped tassel. It was Ja Hyeong-woo’s healer staff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar cowered like a mouse in front of a cat as soon as it encountered Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Master…!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo seemed not to hear it at all. When Ja Hyeong-woo with his menacing face opened the cork of the gourd at his waist, the familiar was instantly sucked inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The familiar that had threatened my life was disposed of so simply by Ja Hyeong-woo’s hands that it was laughable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything around was broken and destroyed. Ja Hyeong-woo, seeing the chaotic surroundings, slowly turned to look this way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first thing he said was unexpected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you awaken?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I flinched inwardly. But since there was nothing to be guilty about, I puffed out my chest confidently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you kidding?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How deceptive a question to ask Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who couldn’t awaken. However, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t back down either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I just teleported to you instantly. As if you definitely have a successor awakening window.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh? That’s strange. Why did that work?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How do I make excuses for this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were ordinary awakening, it would be one thing, but this is an unprecedented half-awakening. If this becomes known to the world, the association will definitely try to interfere with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Must be an error.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to regret spitting out that lame excuse, Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been staring at me, shook his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…That can’t be right. There’s no earth energy at all. You don’t appear on the successor list either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I, who had been standing dumbfounded, soon got indignant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who are you trying to provoke right now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That wasn’t my intention.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then why did you come?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At my question, Ja Hyeong-woo looked down at the gourd at his waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because of this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the dormitory was far away, it seemed only Ja Hyeong-woo had sensed the energy of the familiar that belonged to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A familiar that helps successors in various ways. Ja Hyeong-woo’s had finally appeared, but looking at the gourd, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes were extremely cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A familiar that attacks people without hesitation is inexcusable. Rather than causing an accident, it would be better to eliminate it now…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, wait!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouted loudly in panic. Ja Hyeong-woo stopped talking and looked at me with a puzzled face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that familiar dies, you’re screwed! I can’t directly explain how much help it will be in your future crisis, so I tried to think of how to phrase it like it has intelligence unlike other familiars and could reform later…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was my last memory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I fainted right after, and I was bedridden with aftereffects from overexertion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While delirious with high fever, I opened my eyes to see someone enter my hazy vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dark blue hair tied back in one bundle. Someone wearing a brown-red headband on their forehead, with a gold-embroidered brown vest over a white jeogori.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Silla Dynasty ghost…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I realized shortly after that it was Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, with slightly surprised eyes, tilted his head to the left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can tell you have a severe fever bad enough to not distinguish heaven from earth.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Feeling embarrassed, I snapped back like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get out! You’re making my fever rise by hovering around.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to get up but my body swayed. My head spun round and round, and I hit the back of my head on the bed again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tip of Ja Hyeong-woo’s staff touched the top of my head like last night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you sure it’s okay to use that precious heal skill on me? You’re trying to make me get cursed out in the community, aren’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is my duty. Something I must do even if it means shortening my lifespan to increase skill uses.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? You shortened your lifespan?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His words without any inflection were truly sharp like a blade. His quiet eyes didn’t even blink.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, this was frustrating when reading the original work too. Because of that inflexible, damn sense of responsibility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So he’s saying that since I suffered damage because of his familiar, he’ll take responsibility for my condition with the mindset of picking up the one piece of trash that fell in a clean house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come to think of it, what about the familiar? What happened?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I remembered what I’d forgotten, my spine went cold. How out of it had I been?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing Ja Hyeong-woo’s calm face made my anxiety amplify even more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did he kill it? Is that already the look of someone who killed it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to eliminate it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart sank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I aged ten years. I thought I’d already crossed a river of no return!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You mean you haven’t killed it yet?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I might have seemed suspicious asking so persistently, Ja Hyeong-woo honestly nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right, not yet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Good, I went from a crisis of ruin to a situation where I might be ruined. It felt like barely grasping at straws.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what do I say now? Isn’t it strange for me, who almost died to the familiar, to defend the familiar?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I say ‘But it’s completely obedient to you. It’ll supplement your lacking heal abilities, so try raising it’?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, wait. Let me think more properly. Say Ja Hyeong-woo listens to me and withdraws his decision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then do I have to follow Ja Hyeong-woo around like a daycare teacher, watching whether Ja Hyeong-woo gets along well with the familiar?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who should have died, survived, and the moment the familiar tried to kill that Gyeon Gang-hyeon, their relationship was ruined. There would probably be worse discord than in the original work. Would it improve over time? The situation was so different that I couldn’t be certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I decided to make a somewhat groundbreaking move. Pointing at the gourd, I said this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After catching the collapsing Gyeon Gang-hyeon and laying him down at home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stared blankly at the pale face blooming with fever.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s too thin.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Days devoted only to training without even time to wipe away flowing sweat. The rare leisure of sitting and looking after Gyeon Gang-hyeon felt unfamiliar. Ja Hyeong-woo looked down at the small face with black hair stuck to it and suddenly thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Have I looked at his face this closely in the past few months?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When his eyes were open, only harsh words came out, but seeing his sleeping face made feelings like disappointment disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If awakening was something I could help with, I would have done anything. If you were the type to change your mind with warm words, I would have said anything, however much.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes he regrets it. That he wasn’t an important person or friend to Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So when that incident happened to Gyeon Gang-hyeon a few months ago, he wasn’t someone who could give him comfort.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Well. Taciturn and boring, always following along with whatever you did – that was impossible for me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t leave his side, giving heals whenever the fever spiked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because his body was originally weak, the fever would go down but flare up again whenever Ja Hyeong-woo tried to get up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He ended up sitting back down several times, and eventually stayed the whole time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Gyeon Gang-hyeon would jump if he knew, he directly cared for him, lifting his drooping body to change his sweat-soaked clothes. This was clearly his responsibility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A familiar born to follow me dared to try to kill Gyeon Gang-hyeon without my permission.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t forgive either the familiar with its cruel nature or himself for not knowing anything until it attacked Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He desperately wanted to immediately break the gourd and eliminate the familiar, but he was holding back for a moment thinking there might be something more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After almost dying, he suddenly asks for the gourd containing the familiar. Though he doesn’t know Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s true intentions…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I want to kill that ghost bastard with my own hands. Ah, so infuriating.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words he spat out afterward while huffing convinced him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s just like Gyeon Gang-hyeon to get worked up.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Convinced, Ja Hyeong-woo handed over the gourd to Gyeon Gang-hyeon. He also gave him precautions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you throw and break the gourd, it will be eliminated.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Never open the entrance. It might attack again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no way scoundrel Gyeon Gang-hyeon would carefully listen to Ja Hyeong-woo’s words. Ja Hyeong-woo, sighing inwardly, wrote the precautions on a note and placed it by the head of the nodding Gyeon Gang-hyeon before leaving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Hunter Ja Hyeong-woo is skipping training to do what? Going in and out of Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s house?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Hunter Association president, who received a report from Ja Hyeong-woo’s manager, hung up and drummed his fingers on the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hunter Ja Hyeong-woo leaving the training ground was directly exposed to the media. Since he usually has a sincere image, there won’t be attitude controversy, but even now there will be a flood of inquiries asking what Ja Hyeong-woo is doing…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The association, suddenly established a few months ago, was still small and unstable. Having received too much public attention without time to stabilize, the association was overly conscious of the media.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…I should summon Gyeon Gang-hyeon to the school headquarters. I need to divert attention by revealing Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face. If I can protect Hunter Ja Hyeong-woo, it doesn’t matter if I throw away that trash.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They said Ja Hyeong-woo’s departure was because of Gyeon Gang-hyeon in the first place. Then shouldn’t that scoundrel himself also take responsibility? He got off easy anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having made his decision, the association president immediately picked up the communicator and moved.
 </span>
</p>
