 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if six of them joined forces to face it, that thing was the source of the hallucinations. If they carelessly provoked it, it might show even more horrific visions than now and try to destroy their minds. The risk was too great.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They couldn’t attack now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least, not unless they recharged their stamina to create a slightly more advantageous situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need a stamina recovery skill.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was that the only healer here, Ja Hyeong-woo, wasn’t specialized in stamina recovery.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should he have brought Hae Mi-jun instead of Ja Hyeong-woo? No, then dealing with injuries would have been difficult.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sight of the A-rank boss leisurely watching them gave Gyeon Gang-hyeon a sense of humiliation. These monsters knew how to read their opponents’ momentum and killing intent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The enemies could probably see that their side was currently drained of strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Four Guardian Deities skill…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon immediately dismissed the thought that briefly arose. His only supreme-grade skill had to be saved for greater dangers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No. …I can do that now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even driven to the worst situation, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes didn’t lose their light. There was still another move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Hold the boss among yourselves
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Let me prepare something
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: You still have more preparations left?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me: Yeah
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: Wow, got a good leader
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, wiping still-wet sweat from his forehead, grinned wickedly. It was a smile that wasn’t intimidated even in the difficult situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps gaining some strength, Sa Ye-ho broke the standoff with the boss and drew out his attribute skill first. Myo Cho-hui and Won Ha-ri followed him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon barely managed to steady his trembling limbs and quietly assessed his condition. He was barely keeping his eyes open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, my stomach hurts…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then from behind, a thick forearm squeezed between his side and arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand gently rested over his clothes as if stroking his stomach. Despite having expended quite a bit of skill, the blue light reaching Gyeon Gang-hyeon was still deep and rich.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who couldn’t even curse due to pride, awkwardly raised his arm and groaned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Now he’s touching me completely openly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because this bastard is doing this shit, the community is also going crazy and crazy is everywhere… Gyeon Gang-hyeon calmed his brain that was about to pour out light-hearted complaints like before. He bit his lips to act serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Are you done
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Watch the battle, you crazy bastard
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse Successor: I’m watching that side too, don’t worry.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Hey shit you sent that to group chat
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The blood clot that had risen to his throat went back down. The searing hot pain in his stomach was also washed away like water. Gyeon Gang-hyeon had almost resigned himself to his body’s condition of having to depend on Ja Hyeong-woo’s healing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But his thoughts didn’t stop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though his body trembled with anxiety that he might die. Even though his situation suddenly felt pitiful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now, it was time to send him away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Squeaky.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Ja Hyeong-woo finished treating him and headed toward the front battle scene, Gyeon Gang-hyeon secretly whispered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if he was later criticized by people for having team members block the boss while the leader just stood around blankly, it didn’t matter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because reversing the predetermined order was more important. Though it was too late. At least now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Go to Ja Hyeong-woo. And never come back.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A nightmare he had once had came to mind. Many people dying, and Ja Hyeong-woo standing alone at that scene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A time when high-grade gates open and many people die might come. From now on, coordinate with Ja Hyeong-woo in advance. Save other people.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once a master and familiar achieved perfect harmony, they would never again be able to stay attached to someone else while consuming energy like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, it was farewell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And if he sent away the mouse familiar, Gyeon Gang-hyeon would now have to perform his role as leader while letting go of the lifeline wrapped around his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar appeared in the form of a blue boy. It grabbed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I don’t want to. Because master doesn’t want it.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, this excuse could no longer serve as a reason to change Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mind. Just as Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had already hardened his resolve, was about to say harsher words to make the boy turn away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…I don’t want to either.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s face went blank. His stunned eyes stared at the boy only he could see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tears began flowing down the boy’s chin, drop by drop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The second time seeing tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He remembered how young and impulsive the first mouse familiar had been. There was a time when it cried loudly thinking it had been completely abandoned by its master, Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar at that time was desperate to kill Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Because it thought he would be an obstacle to its master.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Squeaky’s foresight…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now things were different. Gyeon Gang-hyeon acknowledged that he had been an obstacle to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the mouse familiar was crying for Gyeon Gang-hyeon, its worry for him greater than returning to its master.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought this might be the last time seeing the blue boy’s form. Gyeon Gang-hyeon tried to find the two eyes in the faint features. He faced the boy squarely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Thank you for taking care of me all this time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He could see his comrades fighting the boss in the distance gradually becoming exhausted. There was no time to delay. Gyeon Gang-hyeon gently pushed the mouse familiar back as if nudging it, severing his connection with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Come to think of it… I can do this kind of thing now. I didn’t learn it anywhere.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Huh?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His dog familiar popped out from him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The brown boy with tears beaded on his chin ran over and embraced the blue boy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When did they…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar didn’t push away the dog familiar either. It obediently buried its body deeply in that embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The larger brown boy soon lifted his head and raised his hand to wipe the blue boy’s tears. The transparent tears both shed fell endlessly to the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon watched the scene unable to avoid it. Wrapped in a dizzy feeling as if the entire sky and earth were spinning, as if he had become a celestial body in the universe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Strange. What’s strange about this?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something seemed about to surface. His throat was endlessly choked, and while wanting to tear at his chest from frustration, on the other hand his strength was completely drained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho! To your side!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, whose quick mobility had been his lifeline, became noticeably sluggish. The moment he passed by the fierce tiger’s side, the tiger twisted its body faster than Sa Ye-ho could steady his posture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ahhhhh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally large claws struck down at his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On his fluttering floral hanbok, even redder flowers bloomed. The tiger’s teeth were about to embed in Sa Ye-ho’s small head the next moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Won Ha-ri flew over rolling and kicked the tiger away. Since metal attribute’s stat was strength, she was now the strongest among the successors after Woo Sae-geon left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, in a state of having lost much stamina, even Won Ha-ri was merely placed under the tiger’s giant claws.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood vessels stood out all over Ja Hyeong-woo’s body as he cast healing with the feeling of squeezing all his blood vessels to cure Sa Ye-ho’s fatal wound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes opened wide.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Massive energy rose before his eyes as if a deep blue sea was spreading out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blue light surged up the dark mountain as if a tsunami was striking. The light was so enormous that even the large-framed Ja Hyeong-woo looked very small.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it was unmistakably power emanating from one human’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Power to save other living beings. Power worthy of being called a ‘miracle’ by people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that instant, Jin Seol-woon, who caught Sa Ye-ho, turned over his unconscious body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s tattered back was cleanly healed just from Ja Hyeong-woo’s waves brushing it, revealing even the vivid muscle texture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The explosively generated power blurred even the boundary between stamina and injury. Without meaning to distinguish between the two, it was truly power that lifted everything. Even Sa Ye-ho, who had collapsed, opened his eyes before long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shape of a large mouse was reflected behind Ja Hyeong-woo. Standing tall in the storm that made all observers hold their breath and stare, Ja Hyeong-woo was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Completely inappropriate for the situation, he was only staring blankly at the wrong direction behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A devastated face that looked like it might shed a tear simply gazed at Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon also quietly faced Ja Hyeong-woo. After months had passed, it was finally the scene from the original work’s Busan Gate that Gyeon Gang-hyeon remembered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage 44 would become known as the place where Ja Hyeong-woo, the world’s 2nd-ranked healer, manifested his mouse familiar and rose to 1st place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a bedroom at Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun couldn’t fall asleep at all, worried about the people who had entered the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He finally got up completely from his lying position. He sat properly at his desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He replayed the previous stage video for review.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The previous stage had been the floating islands that were former leader Woo Sae-geon’s retirement battle. Hae Mi-jun vividly remembered being there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right after the floating islands experienced a chain collision due to the boss’s appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon and Sa Ye-ho, who had excellent mobility, went directly by stepping on stones, while Hae Mi-jun borrowed Jin Seol-woon’s dragon to ride.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon hyung…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Leaving the injured Gyeon Gang-hyeon behind with just him and Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the darkness, Hae Mi-jun faced his own gaze looking back at Gyeon Gang-hyeon through the screen like a stranger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Will I never be able to sit in that position instead of Hyeong-woo hyung for my entire life…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a time when he had competed with Ja Hyeong-woo in healing speed. But he couldn’t even meaningfully keep up and was completely defeated. In sports terms, it was a devastating defeat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun clenched his fists. He dared to harbor feelings he thought he shouldn’t have.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I want to become a better healer. Even better than Hyeong-woo hyung…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strange emotion that had never occurred even once due to his gentle nature began to eat away at his consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I can’t win in the treatment area… shouldn’t I also create attack skills?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right now, there was one skill among those Hae Mi-jun possessed that seemed usable as an attack skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When doing partial anesthesia, if he anesthetized the brain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t yet know that the dark turn foreshadowing for Hae Mi-jun hadn’t completely disappeared.
 </span>
