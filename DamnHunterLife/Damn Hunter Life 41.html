  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 41
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Jin Seol-woon sees me floundering around in sword classes, he’ll probably want to take back that comment about not using his own sword anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was too noble a sword for this lowly body to wield.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Speaking of which, take that back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s hand, which had been stroking my bow, stiffened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s this? Did I hurt his feelings? I simultaneously remembered that Jin Seol-woon had a sensitive personality that kept dwelling on bad community comments, and that I was currently in a position of receiving help. I hastily added more words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I used it well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the veins that had risen on the back of Jin Seol-woon’s hand still hadn’t disappeared. Even his eyes, which should have been reading the status window, seemed to have stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, I felt wronged enough to make excuses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wasn’t the sword’s name embarrassing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That weird name, I mean. Back then, the emotion of being able to sing again must have been overwhelming, but now isn’t it just dark history?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially since the person he gave it to was a scoundrel like me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get it renamed and then save it for something better.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not embarrassing…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon started to choose his words several times before stopping. As if neither this nor that satisfied him. Then he suddenly ended with irritation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why would you return something that’s already been given?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sensitive bastard. I was doing this all for his sake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t sulk and just get on with the weapon progress. When do we start?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just a moment…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he returns the sword later or not, let’s focus on what’s important first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the weapon crafting department, no one could follow leader Woo Sae-geon. That man was an artisan who could turn even a rolling pencil into a weapon. On the other hand, Jin Seol-woon, who was mediocre at best in this area no matter how generously you looked at it, stared for quite a while before finally setting the bow down on the bench.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If the crafter is inexperienced, the weapon might reject attribute infusion. But this bow is fully prepared to become an attribute weapon. I think even Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, doing it for the first time, should be able to manage it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do inanimate objects have egos or something?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon pulled my hand to rest on the back of his neck, then taught me the techniques of how to maintain breathing when handling weapons and how to inject energy. A pulse beat vigorously within his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For me, having the same attribute, it seemed similar to loosening and tightening a fishing rod’s tension while reeling in a fish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m not sure about this. Like what I used to do for Hae Mi-jun, it would be easier to understand if I brought a respirator and received breath while doing it…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the moment I looked up at Jin Seol-woon and our eyes met with his perfectly sculpted lips, I thought, ‘Not this guy.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if it’s something like artificial respiration, it’s not like we’re really doing it because someone’s life is in danger. This guy’s an idol. I need to protect him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The target grade is definitely S-rank, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it possible…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the highest grade popped out of Jin Seol-woon’s mouth, I was the first to trail off. Jin Seol-woon suddenly focused on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Try it. I’ll help you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For someone like me, I don’t even expect special functions. That’s something only Woo Sae-geon could do, and I just need the bow to shoot arrows properly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I set the bow down on the bench and knelt. Jin Seol-woon attached himself beside me in the same position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I placed both hands overlapping on the bow. Jin Seol-woon’s hand touched my back, then suddenly slipped inside my jeogori. My body jumped at the hot temperature of his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Were you startled?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether it was to calm me down, Jin Seol-woon’s index finger settled on the hollow of my spine and rubbed along the vertebrae. When I glared at him that it wasn’t necessary, he soon just placed his palm quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Please don’t break from enhancement failure. In that case, my body would be screwed too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I started the work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Haah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A naturally heavy breath escaped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The task of manifesting the strong, burning heat originating from the earth that someone lowly like me had to evenly flow through all my blood vessels and let it escape through my fingertips as the final destination was as difficult as the explanation suggested. Whenever my breathing was about to become labored, Jin Seol-woon would stroke my chin with his hand, signaling me to regulate my breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was receiving from Jin Seol-woon what I used to do for Hae Mi-jun. Thinking it was fortunate that Hae Mi-jun wouldn’t see this, I put all my effort into it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How many minutes had I been absorbed in a state of selflessness?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huk!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, my breathing suddenly cleared. The feeling of dirt accumulating in my heart also became completely refreshed. I jerked my head up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I urgently examined the bow first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bow had turned a murky brown color like dead wood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first I was shocked by the color, but fortunately, a subtle earthen energy was rising from it. Just touching it brought a warm temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I made it! Nice!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I burst from Jin Seol-woon’s arms and cheered. Unable to contain my joy, I raised the bow and threw my hands up in celebration, when suddenly my vision went black.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After waiting for a few seconds, light finally returned to my eyes. Jin Seol-woon, who had caught the bow I dropped with one hand and was supporting me with his other arm, looked down at me in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you overdo it? Should I call a healer?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m fine. I know what this is. It’s just because I’m tired.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This isn’t to reassure him—it’s really true. When it was serious before, chills throughout my body followed, but that’s not the case now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When a person has so little stamina, their normal state isn’t much different from narcolepsy… Thanks for helping, and sorry, but I’m going to go home. I need to sleep…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While my eyelids were closing uncontrollably, I concentrated my last bit of strength on pressing the home return function.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And my consciousness cut off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was certain that rather than going home, Gyeon Gang-hyeon would end up falling asleep in his arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But somehow he must have squeezed out the strength, because the return skill activated. Jin Seol-woon was left alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Along with the S-rank bow that Gyeon Gang-hyeon had abandoned without the presence of mind to take with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While he could return the weapon later, he had suspicions that Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had disappeared like that, wouldn’t be in a beautiful state…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon used teleportation to the Dog successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sure enough.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was sprawled on his house floor. It was amusing how his face was relaxed peacefully as if it were a comfortable bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, whose mouth corners had returned to their original position, lifted him up and laid him on the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, what clothes do you wear when sleeping?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no way an answer would come back. He opened the wardrobe next to him. After rolling his eyes this way and that and even opening drawers, Jin Seol-woon let out a quiet laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there nothing but white hanbok in your wardrobe besides underwear?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, Jin Seol-woon’s kindness stopped at untying the clothing strings so it wouldn’t be stuffy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, he sat by the bedside for about 2 hours, watching to make sure there were no problems.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who was it that said, if your gaze goes there five times, it’s love—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he had been keeping an eye on one of the R&amp;B songs, it wasn’t boring. He spent time humming the song in a small voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t particularly rewarding time, but you could also say it wasn’t wasteful. Jin Seol-woon, who had finally checked his temperature by touching his forehead, left his spot. A warm heat lingered for a while where he had been sitting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before that warmth could fade, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s blanket stirred.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar emerged from the top of the blanket, and the dog familiar from below. The familiars that shook off the blanket and got up had already become the forms of two boys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {How tediously long he stayed.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar swept his hand across the spot where Jin Seol-woon had been sitting. All the remaining warmth was erased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar glared at the empty air as if frustrated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I was going to move Hyeon…!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The earthen energy that had been bristling soon settled down, and the boy crouched down to sit beside his master. The mouse familiar sat on the opposite side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Is Hyeon really okay?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {So far.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…The weapon is totally cool. Hyeon is amazing.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar reached out to touch the bow placed on the nightstand. It was an excellent bow. But thinking that this bow had drained his master’s energy, he didn’t feel particularly pleased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {If his energy decreases further, I’ll have to call my master.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two familiars, who had resolved to do their own work in their own places, endured their current uncomfortable coexistence because of one shared purpose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wheezing breathing continued until afternoon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My brand new hot bow that I made.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was going to enter a gate with Ja Hyeong-woo, who takes a lot of energy to deal with, along with two strangers, but thanks to my new weapon, I felt generous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But for a while now…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had pulled his hat down low to conceal his successor identity, kept glancing at my bow. His gaze was persistent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was thinking the bow’s side might wear out at this rate, when Ja Hyeong-woo spoke to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who made that weapon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you imagine that I made it myself?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you sure?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crafter: Gyeon Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone except me can’t grasp information about weapons with different attributes from their own. Knowing this, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t ask to let him try it either. Ja Hyeong-woo muttered quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So it wasn’t made by Jin Seol-woon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, the larger of the two successors who had been about to jump into the gate entrance first turned to look at me and Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah was already tall enough to be slightly taller than me, but this guy was even more hulking. There was someone in successor world who was bigger and more muscular than Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Um…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Sheep successor’s voice flowed out slightly cracked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo made an expression like ‘this isn’t right,’ then shook his head hurriedly as if even that expression wasn’t part of his plan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon he looked at me with determination as if he had made a big decision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t, don’t act up as you please. If you see anything suspicious inside the gate, tell us everything, no, report? And if you act alone, uh, um… I won’t let it slide.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A 19-year-old who’s just big in size. I feel bad while he’s trying to act cool, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the least threatening lecture I’d ever heard.
 </span>
</p>
