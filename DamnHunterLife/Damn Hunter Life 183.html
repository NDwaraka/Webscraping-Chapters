  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 183
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Flame Brand (Fire Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Chollima’s hooves trampled the bamboo leaf soldiers like toys, destroying their formation. Flames erupted from the bodies of the bamboo leaf soldiers crushed under its front hooves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who had been flying around triumphantly, suddenly stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A massive gust of wind arose in front of Ma Cheon-ah. The commander bamboo leaf soldier charged at her with fierce momentum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her hair tied in one bundle streamed long behind her. Ma Cheon-ah’s lips, visible between her hair, curved upward wickedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah straightened her head and drove Chollima forward. Toward the center of the general.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, thunk! An arrow struck perfectly between the general’s helmet and armor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, really! Ma Cheon-ah’s grumbling could be heard, but I leisurely drew a circle and escaped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, seeing me, the commander in the rear raised his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Through the air, through my skin, I could feel the energy of his command. I could tell that the bamboo leaf soldiers had set me as their target.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woof! The dog barked loudly toward the front. Then the arrows that had been raining down on me and Hyeong-woo weakly broke off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly turned direction. Then I passed Yang Pyo, who was pushing back the enemy forces at the front center, and leaped to the opposite side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Into the realm of swords where hundreds of blades sometimes flexibly, sometimes fiercely like torrential rain, pierced through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my mouth and shouted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri turned her body without even looking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Directly facing me as I rode the dog familiar rushing toward her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just before we collided, I narrowly changed course from my side. The wind stirred by the blade grazed my cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The soldiers chasing me encountered Won Ha-ri. They tried to change formation belatedly to block the attack, but they couldn’t avoid the sharp blue sword light that Won Ha-ri raised straight up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bamboo soldiers shattered into pieces. Fragments flew mercilessly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no intention of wasting even a few seconds. While watching that scene, I shot three arrows in succession.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In turn, I pierced through the nape of one high-ranking commander, a soldier at a central point whose fall would obstruct the path of the charging army, and among the bamboo leaf soldiers, one who was particularly skilled and had exchanged several blows with Ma Cheon-ah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, a dragon descended beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There are archers ambushed at 10 o’clock. They’re not moving.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the dragon flew alongside, the rider’s face became clearly visible. I conversed with Jin Seol-woon while running.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because we were closer, I could feel Hyeong-woo from behind examining Jin Seol-woon’s body overall and applying healing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They can’t move. If they shoot arrows trying to kill just nine people, they’ll hit their own allies too. Let’s make them shoot later. At their own allies instead of us, of course.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please give the order then.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Jin Seol-woon finished speaking, a pit formed in the ground. He tilted the dragon to the side and disappeared as if sucked into it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few seconds later, the dragon burst up from the ground in a completely different place, splitting the earth. Bamboo leaf soldiers struck by the dragon fell in droves. Jin Seol-woon grabbed his sword in reverse grip and tilted it diagonally. The thin sword cut down all the bamboo leaf soldiers in the dragon’s path.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the successors belonging to the assault squad stirred up the enemy lines, the remaining people also moved busily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui raised dozens of vines. The bamboo leaf soldiers were completely trapped in the vines that rose like prison bars.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s small feet stepped diagonally on one of the vines that had grown vertically. She took a big running start so the vine would become taut. The glaive, propelled by the vine’s elasticity, successively knocked off the heads of bamboo leaf soldiers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The vines that wrapped around the corpses of the fallen bamboo leaf soldiers gathered together and intertwined. It was to build a barricade.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, the wild boar that Hae Mi-jun rode bypassed the barricade while avoiding the soldiers’ spears. The bamboo leaf soldiers raised dust clouds as they closely pursued him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh—! All the soldiers couldn’t avoid the blue mountain breeze and took it head-on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bamboo leaf soldiers all froze from Hae Mi-jun’s ice skill. They stuck to the barricade in orderly rows, becoming an even sturdier wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under my orders, the two built up a large hill on the barren land. So that the numerically inferior successors could lead this battle as a siege rather than being swept away by the legion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s body atop the hill glowed green.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;House of Trees (Wood Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thick trees grew densely. The trees formed walls above ground. Underground, they extended roots. They dug into the soil.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The roots wound tightly around the soul stones buried under the earth, then persistently burrowed into the center. The stones cracked and split.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I roamed around the barricade, checking the condition of all successors and carefully reading the energy beneath the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There haven’t been any resurrected by soul stones yet. Are they saving them to resurrect as giant soldiers or something? Well, we’re grateful for that.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because we’ll destroy all the soul stones before then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo rode behind me, prioritizing the management of my physical condition while also watching over the team members wherever I went.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So they could conserve skills and defeat small fry with regular attacks alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bamboo leaf soldiers charged blindly as if they weren’t afraid of death. Weapons with lost arms were thrown into the sky, and armor fell and rolled on the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I was worried because there were commanders, but fortunately it’s a manageable level.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They split the legion into multiple parts to attempt surprise attacks from various directions, and among the nine enemies, they found those with gaps and weaknesses to focus their assault on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Good, this is it. Among the monsters I’ve seen, this is top-tier intelligence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But you have to do that against opponents it works on.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If each of us individually has the ability to defeat an army, and if communication and coordination centered on me are perfectly achieved, then it’s a different story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Boom—! An explosion occurred from the arrow I shot. The bamboo leaf soldiers burst and scattered in all directions as if a giant boulder had been attached to the arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whew, I repeated deep breaths, trying to regain my increasingly shortened breathing. Since I was controlling the dog familiar, my stamina was rapidly depleting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, look at me for a moment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Hyeong-woo made me turn around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he lifted the durumagi wrapped around my shoulders. He covered both our heads with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the sudden darkness, something soft and hot devoured my lips. It easily opened the entrance with its tongue and filled me with its breath and saliva.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Crazy bastard…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t even have time to blush. I quickly pushed aside the durumagi and continued the strategy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the moment when the bamboo leaf soldiers, who had seemed endlessly numerous, were starting to show gaps in their forces here and there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rumble—! An ominous earthquake occurred from the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A giant soldier so large it seemed it would cover the entire sky appeared, breaking through the earth. Even allied soldiers were trampled and fell under its feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Its head cast a huge shadow over us. I didn’t hesitate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Abandon the castle!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately, Myo Cho-hui’s rabbit, Hae Mi-jun’s wild boar, and the dog I rode scattered in three directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang! The foot of the bamboo leaf giant struck down where we had been. The entire ground crumpled and fragments shot in all directions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We lost the wall made using all of Myo Cho-hui and Hae Mi-jun’s skills in an instant. But now wasn’t the time to lament.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even one alone was threatening enough to make my knees weak, but several more giant soldiers rose up, tearing through the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Four of them…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They wore red, yellow, green, and blue cloth tied to their helmets in order.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next moment, the monkey familiar appeared. The familiar raised its sword hidden in mist and clashed with the huge sword of the yellow giant soldier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Screech—! The power struggle was evenly matched. A spine-chilling sound rang from the crossed blades.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After confirming that Won Ha-ri was handling one giant with her familiar, I quickly decided on the next move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo! Ma Cheon-ah! You two take the red one!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Yang Pyo collided with the giant soldier and scattered its energy, Ma Cheon-ah stepped on Yang Pyo’s back and leaped up to attack. The two, who used to growl at each other daily, now knew how to fight in coordination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then the barricade personnel will take the green one…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be tough for me to defend alone, but if Hyeong-woo takes care of my body and Myo Cho-hui and Hae Mi-jun provide support, the four of us should be able to take down one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, one giant soldier would remain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hastily assigned Jin Seol-woon to lure it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon! Don’t think about taking it down alone, just draw its attention! We’ll deal with this side first and then come—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stopped speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because feather-light footsteps had landed on the nape of the running dog familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thin skirt fabric embroidered with red flowers fluttered before my eyes. Sa Ye-ho stood on the dog, looking at the blue giant soldier with his lips twisted in a grin. As if looking at delicious prey.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I have that one?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was specialized in causing chaos in enemy lines with rapid mobility, but didn’t have the skill to take down strong individuals like bosses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In normal circumstances, that is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had a high-level skill that had manifested relatively recently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I first saw the activation conditions for that skill, I was left speechless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This bastard is really insane.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I absolutely couldn’t understand it with my common sense. What was so good about it for that person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hiss—! The snake familiar slipped close beside the dog. As soon as Sa Ye-ho mounted the snake’s back, it quickly slithered toward the giant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho ran briefly on the snake. The snake raised its head up to the sky’s end. At perfect timing, Sa Ye-ho stepped on the snake’s head and leaped to an unbelievable height.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The giant’s huge helmet tilted upward. I watched the scene of one human, insignificantly small compared to that giant, plunging down from the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Yearning for the Sun (Fire Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Red tattoos resembling flames wound around his snow-white skin. The tattoos even climbed up to the hand holding the dagger. The dagger turned red-hot like heated iron, then its length suddenly extended to match Sa Ye-ho’s height.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The giant’s hand grabbed! at the empty air where Sa Ye-ho was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there was no way the sluggish giant could keep up with Sa Ye-ho’s speed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the blink of an eye, the giant’s arm that had grasped only empty air caught fire from hand to shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
