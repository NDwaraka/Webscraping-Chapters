  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 74
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Sa Ye-ho says that much, I can’t possibly not know. Ja Hyeong-woo is currently protesting to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A healer, that bastard, is hurting his own body and not treating it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But what am I supposed to do to appease him? I even apologized saying I won’t do it again!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just thinking about it gives me a headache. I should pick a fight with Sa Ye-ho to relieve this feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, you should have stopped me when I was doing that yesterday. Were you just watching the fight?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I spoke, Sa Ye-ho’s sole hit my forearm. At the light impact, I made an “ugh” sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey you, you fucking bastard, I did stop you!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought no one stopped me and just watched. Sa Ye-ho’s testimony was a bit different from my memory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He says at first he went to Ja Hyeong-woo acting cheeky like “Hey hey hey, what’s wrong?” and grabbed him, and when Ja Hyeong-woo ignored him, he came to me too and said “Hey hey, stop it, stop.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it seemed like I couldn’t see or hear him, and when Ja Hyeong-woo hit his own body with a rock, he went “Ew” and backed away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really? I didn’t know. Hey, hurry up and watch the screen. You’re dying.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was disadvantageous, I turned the paused game back on and pointed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, such a shallow trick was nowhere near enough. Sa Ye-ho stopped it again with hand movements faster than light. He wasn’t done talking yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Pyo was scared to step forward himself, so he made a fuss telling me to try stopping it. Sae-geon hyung had a face like he wanted to bring popcorn.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, that human. I frowned and showed my displeasure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, whose already narrow eyes had widened even more to become axe-eyes, finally let out a small laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just kidding. Anyway, Sae-geon hyung had no intention of stopping it either. He just said this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If it had been a recorded setting, he would have half-killed you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whether I stop it or not, it’s the same. Leave it alone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that’s what Woo Sae-geon said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The three who don’t know about the Mouse Familiar, how much did they understand while listening to my argument with Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you really have the psychology of trying to get healing by self-harm blackmail against Ja Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should be playing a game at least. Since I already paused it, I can’t pretend to be distracted. I just avoided eye contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho thought seriously for a while without playfulness, then continued that seriousness and muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But doing it on purpose is fucking insane.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re saying that too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho caught the moment I got annoyed and shut his mouth for now. He read the atmosphere and finished what he had to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you hadn’t been caught here, how much more were you planning to do? Until Ja Hyeong-woo becomes the world’s best healer?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know, I don’t know. I exercised my right to remain silent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “In that sense, I’m on Ja Hyeong-woo’s side.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know what changes when he picks sides…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One thing I do know. Even though he says he’s on someone else’s side, Sa Ye-ho’s eyes looking at me were quite gentle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But fuck, that guy’s crazy too. From what I see, you two bastards are on the same level. All same-age kids are nothing but crazy. Huung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The atmosphere quickly crumbled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …That’s so like Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the craziest, you insane bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The evening of the day Stage 34 was cleared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bathing took a long time because of the chest wound. Ja Hyeong-woo had finished showering and just changed clothes. He ignored his hunger and just sat on the bed waiting for something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the familiar sent a signal from afar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Is he asleep?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The answer came back that he was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stood up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The space changed, and the now-familiar air clung heavily to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He stared at the back lying face-down on the bed without even changing clothes. His face was buried in the sheets, and both ankles stuck out from the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar casually spoke to Ja Hyeong-woo, who stood like a stone statue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…I’ll correct one thing. This guy only thought of and carried out such acts today. You don’t know either, but Gyeon Gang-hyeon is—.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. He gets sick easily anyway. He’s weak.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You get sick often, making me hurt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So you especially shouldn’t have done such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You shouldn’t have thought of hurting yourself on purpose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He turned Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body over to lie properly. His completely unconscious upper body rolled limply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fluttering hair flowed from his left forehead to the right. Long downcast eyelashes caught the evening light from the window, creating a sorrowful shade on his cheek.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing that sight, a sigh escaped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon, I really…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he couldn’t continue the rest. Ja Hyeong-woo irritably swept up the hair on his forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though his heart ached as if completely shattered, he was disgusted with himself for being unable to say “I hate you” even in anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wish you wanted to have me too. No, if such things are too much for me… I just hope you’d be a little more generous to me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Can’t you let me stay by your side at least as much as you allow others? Can’t you smile at me too? Even if it’s annoying teasing and giggling…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, Ja Hyeong-woo consciously stopped his monologue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he hadn’t cut it off in the middle, he might have just stared until dawn.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Either way, hadn’t he come to replenish Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s insufficient yang energy?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘One stage, one treatment. According to what the Mouse Familiar estimated.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He immediately lowered his head and pressed his lips to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the slightly parted skin obediently received him, Ja Hyeong-woo set his teeth and gnawed at the tender mucous membrane, making bite marks. Heat circulated in the quickly swollen plump lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems his unstable emotions from earlier hadn’t completely settled. He was applying pressure matching his resentment, somewhat intensely, not caring that Gyeon Gang-hyeon was panting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While bending the angle further, Ja Hyeong-woo kissed as if pressing the face below into the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmng…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time the mucous membrane was poked with his tongue tip, Gyeon Gang-hyeon moaned hazily in his sleep. Without any self-reproach, Ja Hyeong-woo used his partner’s physical reactions during sleep as an aphrodisiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m not sorry. I received a bigger wound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that Gyeon Gang-hyeon wouldn’t wake up, the Mouse Familiar would hold Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s unconscious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo lifted his head straight. He looked down at his opponent who couldn’t resist whatever happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between the lips he had just been holding with his tongue, he pushed in his right index and middle fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The inevitably sensitive terminal nerves were rubbed by warm, moist mucous membrane. Ja Hyeong-woo closed his eyes and felt the sensation inside. He rummaged inside as he pleased, kneading the soft flesh. The feeling of his fingers getting wet with saliva was maddeningly good.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah… mmng…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The part that flinched when pressed with his tongue showed the same reaction to his fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He pushed his thumb in as well, and while bending his fingers inside, he pushed in one more joint’s length. The lips spread wide enough to be overwhelming. Hidden red inner flesh could be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eyes that looked fierce beyond intense glared at the inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if drawn, his other hand went up. He pulled the goreum neatly placed on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s chest. With a tuk, the sound of knots coming undone behind, pale bare chest was revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The half-naked body, neither fully undressed nor dressed, was strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, a large outline formed on his left thigh and groin. The fabric stretched taut. Ja Hyeong-woo, feeling constricted, exhaled low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Desire and heart seemed to go in opposite directions yet lean toward one direction. Caught up in resentment, this time he didn’t control himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his other hand, he pulled down pants and underwear and took out his cock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With awkward, choppy movements, he stroked his own. However, soon, before long, he learned the knack of what felt good. He rubbed the surface with his palm, sometimes pressing the glans firmly with his thumb, and sometimes scratching from the root with his fingertips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could his whole body tingle just from putting fingers in Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mouth?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ngh… haa.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood rushed to his cock, making it harden further. Water flowed from the small gap, wetting his palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He pulled out the fingers that had been exploring inside the mouth. He put the saliva-soaked fingers in his own mouth to suck once, then gripped Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s pants hem and pulled them down at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Below the underwear, the white thighs he had wanted appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had climbed onto the bed, grabbed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s legs and pulled them toward himself. The buttocks naturally lifted together. Keeping Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s knees together and fixed in that state created a narrow gap between the two thighs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he mercilessly inserted his erect cock, pleasure spread throughout his body from the burningly tingling sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ngh…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Veins bulged on his forearms. From then on, he moved frantically back and forth. With instinctive movements, he thrust his cock between the thighs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being like a first experience, he occasionally frowned and shuddered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dark red cock spread the thighs tightly. The more so, the more Ja Hyeong-woo gripped the two round knees tighter and pressed his thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tender thigh flesh was pressed according to how the shaft curved and swelled. The skin rubbed by the hard surface turned red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing the two shaking legs were his own, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s upper body and face remained quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon clear pre-cum flowed down the thighs. That was quite exciting to see, but he couldn’t dirty Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s underwear. Ja Hyeong-woo moved his hands with what little reason remained, wiping away the flowing liquid intermittently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huu, ngh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He forgot the pain from the chest wound. His whole body felt like it would melt. Anyone seeing him now would testify that his eyes weren’t properly focused.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the feeling of ejaculation burned as if it would incinerate his head, finally reaching an unbearably difficult stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo barely pulled out one thought from his brain devoured by sexual sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that he was currently performing treatment as a healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was said that sharing the body’s breath, water, and soul transfers energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if you think about it, the liquid that would contain the most yang energy in a man’s body is—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He made his decision and positioned his vein-bulging cock over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without hesitation, semen spurted onto the stomach and chest. White fluid scattered up to the chin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Haa, ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stiffened his leg muscles and regulated his rough breathing. His breathing lowered again. The act also came to an end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought there would be some flinching when the liquid was felt, but Gyeon Gang-hyeon was still sleeping obliviously. His expression was even comfortable and languid. …Is it because the liquid is warm?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the lingering sensation that had been heating his body completely disappeared, only a helpless feeling remained. Ja Hyeong-woo carefully lowered Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s legs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the familiar confirmed it. That the act just now was also an act of giving yang energy to Gyeon Gang-hyeon. That thanks to it, the energy of the living was abundantly full.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He made a warm wet towel from the bathroom. He wiped the white-stained upper body and chin several times to erase traces. The red-rubbed inner thighs became perfect with light healing skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To confirm whether it was really cleanly wiped, Ja Hyeong-woo bent his waist and put his nose to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s upper body to smell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the faintly remaining semen smell mixed with Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body scent, an unimaginably lewd smell pierced into his nostrils. His eyes widened as blood rushed to his thighs with a throb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To avoid getting hard again, Ja Hyeong-woo pressed his chest wound to refresh his mind with pain.
 </span>
</p>
