  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 155
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun quickly smiled brightly. Gang-hyeon hyung didn’t seem to notice anything strange about his appearance, and since he was smiling, Gang-hyeon raised the corners of his mouth in response.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was always such a cool person. Even when sad feelings arose, they would fade away, and Hae Mi-jun bit his spoon and smiled weakly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They finished eating around the same time. Gyeon Gang-hyeon began gathering the trays and utensils with clattering sounds. Hae Mi-jun grabbed Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s hand once and smoothly pushed him aside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll clean up! Gang-hyeon hyung, go take care of your work!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really? Thanks.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were before, even knowing Gang-hyeon hyung was busy, he would have said “I’ll bring dessert!” and tried to see him for even a few more minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Gang-hyeon hyung too—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why aren’t you going?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to go there because Ja Hyeong-woo is there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The image of Gang-hyeon hyung sprawled on the sofa and grumbling was still vivid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun pointlessly looked at the sofa once. Naturally, it was completely empty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon hyung isn’t angry because he dislikes Hyeong-woo hyung, but because he’s embarrassed.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had firmly resolved that he couldn’t give up without even confessing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not yet, his skills couldn’t completely heal Gyeon Gang-hyeon yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if it meant trying to beat Ja Hyeong-woo, someday he wanted to push him aside and claim the spot next to Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even if he really could win someday.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…This is right. Gang-hyeon hyung should be with Hyeong-woo hyung.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon wouldn’t want him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s okay. I’m glad it’s before confessing. Hae Mi-jun constantly repeated to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I would have just made Gang-hyeon hyung uncomfortable, and hyung would have been at a loss, feeling sorry for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun didn’t want an ending where they’d just watch each other’s reactions and eventually grow distant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun sat alone at the empty dining table. It was the exact spot where Gyeon Gang-hyeon had been sitting. The fact that the warmth remaining in the chair had completely cooled due to the passage of time was unbearably melancholy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I couldn’t do anything for him, couldn’t even convey my feelings.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s fortunate that it’s before doing so.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Two hearts fought and clashed within his chest. It felt like his heart was being torn to shreds. Hae Mi-jun couldn’t stop his emotions from flowing wildly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just one more month and he’d be 18.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His height had already grown to match Gang-hyeon hyung’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hah, the air he breathed deeply felt sharp as it blocked his throat. His nose stung. His dazed eyes turned downward, then his mouth opened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hng, huuk, huung…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tears came pouring out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His head felt heavy, and unable to bear it, he buried his forehead in his arms. He sobbed as sadly as a flood. Salty tears flowed endlessly from his poorly twisted mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that someday he could smile while remembering this moment, he cried to his heart’s content today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To get straight to the point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stage number that went backward wasn’t an error, they said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I inquired with the system, it said that number was correct. They didn’t tell me the reason. Systems are always like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was my job to bang my forehead on the desk and agonize.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What am I supposed to announce to the public about this…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I briefly imagined myself making an official announcement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The numbers are somehow going backward but it’ll probably be fine, I’ll do my best. What else could I say besides the same old nonsense?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After gathering the Twelve Zodiac in the conference room, I shared information about the stage. Since I’m the leader, I maintained as calm an expression as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone was surprised and puzzled, chaotically offering various opinions. It was no different from a class meeting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “From 1 to 44. It was always consecutive ascending order. Isn’t it a bit early to be shaken just because that rule broke? We should at least see the next number before discussing it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, who lacked emotion and didn’t possess fear, currently the eldest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Weren’t you very surprised? Are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who didn’t know what the point was…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If what should have been 45 became 33, could there be a numerical correlation between the two numbers?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And model student Hae Mi-jun, who seemed to be drifting off topic somehow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, don’t think about other things and just stay put. This is something for me and the big guys to figure out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While scribbling notes with my pen, I habitually stroked Hae Mi-jun’s head with my other hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Flinch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun noticeably startled, so I whipped around. Ah, no sir. Hae Mi-jun flailed and quickly waved his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His downcast expression bothered me somehow and I was about to look more closely when Yang Pyo’s gloomy voice stopped me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The system must be broken. Or maybe we who enter the stages are broken. Something’s definitely broken…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, he was scared out of his wits and talking nonsense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of Yang Pyo, I had to pull myself together and put on airs. Pretending that strange numbers were no big deal. Pretending to be prepared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ma Cheon-ah from the side crossed her arms and glanced at Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why do you only think negatively? The previous stage 33 might appear as is. Then it would be super easy, right? What were the monsters back then?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In situations like this, Ma Cheon-ah’s baseless confidence is helpful. I looked at Ma Cheon-ah fondly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well said, Ma Cheon-ah. You review stage 33 again and bring me a summary.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After giving a glance to Won Ha-ri, who was keeping her mouth tightly shut and clearly anxious, I immediately turned to Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho, call Woo Sae-geon and ask what he thinks about this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung said if I ask one more future-oriented question like that, he’ll spit and disappear.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just try it. I’ll chase him to America.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, I stared in Jin Seol-woon’s direction to hear his opinion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Our gazes met quietly for a while. His lips, which had been staring at me intently, slowly parted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m starting to think the end might be approaching.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kids who had been chattering distractedly stopped abruptly. Heads turned toward him one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon looked around at everyone with a businesslike attitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It went from 44 to 33. If this isn’t an error… my next predicted number is 22. After that, 11. The last would be 0.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  0, meaning nothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A number that had never been used anywhere. Jin Seol-woon mentioned the possibility of stage 0.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It would have been good if Leader Woo Sae-geon were here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo said weakly. Though he immediately got his mouth slapped by Ma Cheon-ah’s palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even hearing words seeking the previous leader’s presence to my face, I wasn’t particularly bothered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I too think of that old fart whenever I’m at a loss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for me, Sa Ye-ho, Ja Hyeong-woo, and Myo Cho-hui, everyone seemed to think Jin Seol-woon’s hypothesis was plausible. The small eyes all looked at me uniformly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I half-rose from my seat while raising the corners of my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whatever, whether it’s stage 0 or whatever, we’ll just smash it all. It’s good if we can see the end.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I said that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My true feelings could only be brought out when the meeting ended and I was alone in the office.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Could we really be heading toward the original story’s final chapter?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That very final chapter I hadn’t been able to read.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Moreover, now that the cheat key called the original story has been exhausted… couldn’t it be said that I’m finally truly living as Gyeon Gang-hyeon?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because ordinary people don’t know the future that will befall them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing is natural order, and rather, I who had known the future had been deviating from providence all this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But what the hell is the number 11?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stage numbers estimated to decrease in units of 11.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s an ambiguous number. If it were 12, I would have immediately thought of the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whine. The doggy who had been serving as a foot warmer under my feet squirmed sleepily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked down at the brown fur ball under the chair. Just as I was only watching since patting with my foot seemed inappropriate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, a realization struck my mind. My heart dropped with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  11th. The dog’s number in the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It was… pointing to me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first stage number I faced after becoming leader was 44.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the numbers began rewinding backward. Centered on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The office scenery began spinning round and round.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ceiling and floor mixed together. Furniture like the sofa lost their forms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My vision, which had gone completely white for a moment, soon drew out a different scene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A black gate that looked like a black hole. Ja Hyeong-woo standing alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a sight I’d seen before. A memory I’d put aside because I couldn’t understand its meaning. Some scene that might be a prophetic dream or might not be, or perhaps a disappeared future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Could there be a reason for seeing the same scene multiple times?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought that maybe this was the latter part of the original story I hadn’t been able to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after properly looking around at the surrounding environment did I realize.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This isn’t South Korea.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was inside a different space, inside a stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then what is that black entrance? Is there another gate inside a gate?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Important information. Though I couldn’t be certain since I hadn’t read it, if this really was the original story’s final chapter, I had to see everything without missing anything. I forced my brain to remember.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But something was strange. This is a stage, a place only successors can enter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then these bloodstains scattered everywhere…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A chill rose in my heart. That vivid color approached as terror that could stop one’s breath. I raised my hand to cover my mouth. I wanted to cover my eyes more than watch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I absolutely didn’t want to believe that my team members could die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>

  I was forced to look straight ahead as if someone had grabbed my head from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was still looking up at the sky. He was saying something. His lips held a familiar name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Hyeon-a. What should I do with you.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, immersed in despair, searched for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My consciousness crumbled into pieces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the pitch-black darkness, I fell endlessly. I screamed with all I had and stretched out both arms. It was painful. I had fallen away from the world. Into the underground, into the black earth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Into the soil.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Huk!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head, which had been lying down, bounced up from the desk. Tears that had pooled in my eyes fell away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately after, I slumped, but didn’t collapse to the floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to a small brown crown supporting my torso and hugging me tightly with all its strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Hyeon-a. You are you. No matter what you go through, you’ll never change.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump thump thump, my heart beat intensely. It couldn’t be the dog familiar’s; it was mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The doggy, who had brought his ear close to my heart, desperately pleaded as if standing on a cliff’s edge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Ask him too. He’ll say the same thing.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ask Ja Hyeong-woo…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Knock knock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, we both startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Someone knocked from outside the office.
 </span>
</p>
