  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 161

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui was managing the bunker’s air like a ghost, avoiding everyone’s notice. Hae Mi-jun’s eyes had turned bright red as he mechanically continued his tasks. Yang Pyo’s face was also ashen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had gone up to dig through the earth with his dragon familiar and reached near the surface, returned shaking his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I can’t go outside right now either. If I go out, everything will burn up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In other words, they were stuck spending more time in the underground bunker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every minute and second, while burdening their leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun hung his head. Tears flowing down his chin dripped onto his collar. Yang Pyo moved his gaze restlessly, fidgeting with his clothes and only sighing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fuck, this atmosphere could hold a funeral.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been chewing on jerky, clicked his tongue softly. It was a habit he’d picked up from Yoon Sae-geon. Or maybe not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He confirmed that Jin Seol-woon had silently emerged from the back and was leaning against the wall. Sa Ye-ho opened his lips lightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If we protect Gyeon Gang-hyeon, don’t you think he’ll protect all of us too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked up above his head. Above was sturdy earth that would never break through, even though the surface had become a burning hell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the owner of that power was currently coughing up blood and half-dying while leaning against Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he truly wouldn’t die. There was no way Gyeon Gang-hyeon would go so easily. They say sickly people live long. Sa Ye-ho convinced himself arbitrarily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t really understand what you mean… Are you saying it’s right for Gang-hyeon hyung to sacrifice himself because we protected him?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, no, you bastard. I’m saying we trust him.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he was incomparably weaker than Sae-geon hyung, Gyeon Gang-hyeon also had the power to make people believe in him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But what’s the point. The important thing is, we’re human trash hiding in a bunker made by the weakest person and just consuming food…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho frowned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What’s with Yang Pyo now. Why did his eloquence suddenly improve. And in such a dark direction.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grabbed Yang Pyo’s chin and shoved a piece of jerky into his mouth. After making his struggling, mumbling jaw move up and down, he snorted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We can’t not eat. Us conserving our strength is helping.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Jin Seol-woon, who had been quiet, reached for dried rations from his inventory. He chewed the food roughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as attention focused on him, Jin Seol-woon didn’t stop moving his jaw aggressively. He muttered self-deprecatingly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not going on broadcasts anymore anyway. At least my expression.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silent time passed. During that time, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t come out from beyond that earthen wall for even a moment. He continuously cared for Gyeon Gang-hyeon without eating or drinking anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon continued fighting even while unconscious. He wagered his own body to compete with the boss monster for time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he won.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dawn broke, and the fireballs that had been pounding the ground disappeared like a lie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [STAGE 33 has been cleared.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors who hadn’t fought directly also clearly confirmed that notification. They were greatly surprised and rushed into the inner room together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been lying there like dead, suddenly sat up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His vision shook from getting up so suddenly. He could see his teammates with happy faces rushing toward him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s been cleared!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Joyful, somewhat bewildered voices could be heard. All that commotion quickly faded from his ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The strength left his wide-open eyes. Gyeon Gang-hyeon collapsed limply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before the commotion could start, Ja Hyeong-woo quickly caught him in his arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t remember the situation that followed well. Because Ja Hyeong-woo ignored all procedures and only acknowledged the time from when he laid Gyeon Gang-hyeon on the bed as his own time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wiped down the unconscious Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body with a wet cloth and changed his clothes. In contrast to how he had suffered from the cold inside the stage, his fever shot up instantly on the bed. The state of exhaustion continued for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His limp fingers didn’t move even once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t look at anything else. His entire world was tied to the powerless hand he was holding. External matters like Association document processing and stage video reviews were all dumped on Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Sa Ye-ho hadn’t blocked the recording content and scenes of Ja Hyeong-woo kissing the sleeping person and doing immoral things were revealed to the world, he wouldn’t have cared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the same as that time. When he had just awakened at the Busan Gate and was spitting blood. Back then too, Gyeon Gang-hyeon had suffered from high fever and couldn’t wake up for three days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It would be good if this isn’t aftereffects, but awakening pains for something new…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet with another part of his heart, he didn’t want to burden Gang-hyeon with more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only you had been a completely ordinary normal person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything except Gyeon Gang-hyeon was kicked out of his mind like stones on the road. He stared at only the pale complexion all day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while having such extreme thoughts that he wouldn’t mind killing anything that tried to capture his attention instead of Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I would like you to show me Gang-hyeon-nim.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t ignore Gang-hyeon’s manager alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo silently connected the status window. He showed the haggard face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The young man, unable to do anything for himself, was only quiet. He had lost too much weight in just a few days, making his cheeks look somewhat sunken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He worked so hard to gain weight.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Months of effort had gone to waste. For Ja Hyeong-woo, it was enough that he was alive, but Gyeon Gang-hyeon himself would probably feel dejected when he woke up and touched his gaunt cheeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He maintained a calm expression with dead black eyes even while Park Yoon-seok swallowed tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ja Hyeong-woo successor-nim. Sa Ye-ho successor-nim.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A long silence stretched. Only after Sa Ye-ho, who was beside him, tapped his shoulder did Ja Hyeong-woo realize his name had been called.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Would you speak with me for a moment?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an incomprehensible request. He had nothing to say to Park Yoon-seok. He had only exchanged words occasionally when checking on Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it was about Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s matter, it would be worth listening to, but what was the reason for mentioning Sa Ye-ho as well?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You just need to listen. There’s something I’d like you two, who are Gang-hyeon-nim’s friends, to know even now. It’s about the past… but it reaches into the present.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok began a long story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an unbelievable story. But because it was truth, it carried the sharpness of a blade.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s mind burned completely white.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He was always in that much pain…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why didn’t this bastard say anything…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Sa Ye-ho’s pale, pressing shouts sounded broken and fragmented.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wished someone would tell him what he should do now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunter School remained silent for a full day. It didn’t convey any news to the outside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Silent Hunter School… What’s the truth about the clearing?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The situation Korea will face if it failed]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Outside news speculated about everything, either calming or stoking anxiety.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing that regular hunters’ power remained intact, the successors hadn’t all died in battle inside the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was just normal so far, but even after the successful clearing result came out, no recorded broadcast appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [‘Please reveal the clearing process’ – Netizens trembling with anxiety]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Was the clearing that difficult… Silent Gyeon Gang-hyeon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Public opinion aside, the Association’s Kim Jae-moon couldn’t overlook the profits that stage broadcasts brought in. Eventually, he prepared to release the video without even getting Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s permission.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one who struck Kim Jae-moon in the back of the head was none other than.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even though the person involved, Gang-hyeon-nim, doesn’t want this, I wonder what help it would be…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Yoon-seok, who had conspired with the successors who couldn’t stand by their leader. He was prepared for the Association’s criticism to pour down on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I suppose I want to cause trouble at this age too. Following my heart.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Park Yoon-seok’s interview content shook public opinion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon had fallen into a coma while protecting his comrades in the stage and still hadn’t regained consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Many people have really been curious about what kind of person 2nd generation successor leader Gyeon Gang-hyeon was. What kind of person receives such conflicting evaluations, what kind of person is a coward who kicked away awakening with his own feet.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The deliberately provocative opening led to shocking content.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Organs deteriorating to the point of coughing blood, symptoms of blood vessels twisting. This is the pain Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon experienced. No, I don’t mean just the recent few days. A week ago, months ago… and even a year ago.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He revealed that the current appearance of suffering from excessive combat was identical symptoms to past awakening failure side effects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [He humbly swallowed the criticism of those who didn’t know. Not wanting to hurt others, he left himself as the villain.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A person who, despite experiencing that pain, accepted the leader position following others’ expectations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Did I say earlier that he experienced this pain from a year ago? No, let me correct that. It was from even earlier.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Information that only the manager knew was revealed to the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the story from when young people were first dragged into gates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A 22-year-old long-term hospital patient disappeared from a certain hospital.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who had been fighting illness since age fifteen due to an incurable disease inherited from his mother.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While living each day powerlessly between pain and painkillers… he was dragged to a place called Hunter School and met a miracle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His body, changed by impending awakening, eliminated the disease.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who became Gyeon Gang-hyeon, dreamed new dreams.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, inside a certain gate, with a terrified expression, he turned his back on his comrades and missed his awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How brutal the violence that followed was. How much it destroyed one person’s heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He also revealed that the harsh words he’d spoken to students back then weren’t drunken rambling but words spoken completely sober. That’s how unwell his mental state was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [He’s someone who has always fought with life. Someone who got back up after falling and tried to smile.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo read every article about Gyeon Gang-hyeon while caring for him beside his bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then when he looked up, there was Gyeon Gang-hyeon with his fever completely gone and breathing comfortably.
 </span>
</p>
