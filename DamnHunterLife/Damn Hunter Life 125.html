  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 125
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The legendary Korean monster Gangcheol was an imugi. A dragon that failed to become complete.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The characteristics described varied by document—in some places it was depicted as an imugi that brought heavy rains to kill crops, while in others it was shown burning things to death with fire. Thanks to this, even before entering there had been much debate about whether Gangcheol was water attribute or fire attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was impossible to know which was correct until seeing it directly inside the stage, Woo Sae-geon had gathered both earth and water attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the result was:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fire attribute. Ja Hyeong-woo, focus on debuffs. Hae Mi-jun will handle healing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon commanded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the white snowy mountain, imugi as large as anacondas reared up into the sky and crashed down to the ground repeatedly. Wherever their tails struck, flames erupted and snow melted instantly, revealing sticky bare earth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If the small fry are this formidable, how big will the boss be?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But before that, there was a more serious problem.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wouldn’t it be less cold if I went close to the imugi and fought in melee?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The heat that the black durumagi had been holding was now completely cooled. I was pretending to be calm while drawing my bow and shooting at the imugi, but my arms were trembling from the cold. My aim kept slipping slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I tried to stick close to Ma Cheon-ah with her fire attribute because of the cold, but Ma Cheon-ah was the type to dart around everywhere like Hong Gil-dong and had already disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then at least Hae Mi-jun…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned my gaze while shivering. Hae Mi-jun, seeing my face, was startled and quickly embraced me to comfort me against the cold. During this time I kept feeling gazes from behind, but I stubbornly didn’t turn around and just sent chats instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just because I look a bit pitiful, does that mean he can waste his attention on me? Ja Hyeong-woo’s attitude is wrong right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>

  Mouse Successor&gt;Me: Eat something warm after this ends.
 </b>
</p>
<p>

  Mouse Successor&gt;Me: And don’t come wearing just underwear from now on. Actually, just don’t come to stages at all.
 </b>
</p>
<p>

  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Ah shit
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I had a separate purpose. While pretending to be annoyed, I whispered in Hae Mi-jun’s ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, give me some water.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Ah, yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if I would ask for water because I’m thirsty in this urgent situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I was deliberately pressing my body against his excessively to receive Hae Mi-jun’s water energy. How fortunate that it’s Hae Mi-jun who’s yin-natured, not Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun quickly understood my meaning and placed his hand on the cold skin of my wrist. He didn’t forget to cover it with his wide sleeve so it wouldn’t be filmed. A cool sensation spread through the warm energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s clearly water energy that feels cold even in the middle of this winter wind blowing fiercely, but strangely I don’t feel cold. Does it not steal my body’s heat?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, there was a reason I specifically asked Hae Mi-jun for energy. Even &lt;Grave of the Dead&gt;, which I’d used so much that its effects were already familiar, becomes completely different like a whole other skill when water energy is fused with it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It used to be a skill that could match Woo Sae-geon’s intermediate skills even when used alone, but Woo Sae-geon’s intermediate became advanced and advanced became supreme, so only I became trash…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it’s different when the premise of mixing other energies comes in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An arrow of an unheard-of color with water and earth mixed in shot out among the usual fire skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who had been riding her horse well through the burning fields, suddenly hesitated. She looked up at my arrow in surprise, then quickly came to her senses and focused on battle again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Indeed, the imugi that hadn’t budged at regular arrows were being pushed back hard by each fusion arrow. The flames burning on their bodies died down as if cold water had been poured on them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Here, additionally:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I add it there?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I nocked a bare arrow and shot it to lightly graze Ma Cheon-ah’s greatsword just as she was about to bind and subdue an imugi.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m guessing that while fire attributes are similar to each other, if I mix earth into it, it’ll gain solidity.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I add my skill to someone else’s skill on the spot, the opponent’s skill becomes more powerful and I don’t have to worry about my body getting hurt from receiving someone’s yin energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The greatsword that absorbed the earth energy from my arrow successfully captured the imugi. Flames erupted from the imugi’s tail tip and attacked Ma Cheon-ah, but she succeeded in enduring without being pushed back even by fire hotter than her own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to do it alone! Can’t you stay still?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah seemed to be grumbling about something, but it’s not my concern. I pretended not to know and played dumb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Around that time, Woo Sae-geon, who had declared he would increase the clearing speed, looked at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going to dive in now. Alone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was just Woo Sae-geon speaking in his characteristically domineering way, but I suddenly stopped at a certain sense of déjà vu.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Focus on me. Don’t miss any attack. If even one grazes me, I’m finished.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strategy where he would change the system so Ja Hyeong-woo would do wound recovery instead of stamina recovery—specifically predictive healing—while Woo Sae-geon himself would pierce more sharply between the monsters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was natural that Ja Hyeong-woo was familiar with it since he’d been refining it all along… but this time what felt familiar to me was Woo Sae-geon’s lines. After searching my memory briefly, I soon remembered what it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ve seen this in the original work.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original story had been greatly twisted due to my existence, and reality had roughly caught up to the mid-story content I knew, so my reserves were almost exhausted. At such a time, this was a rare taste of foresight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right now it’s Woo Sae-geon doing the dangerous thing, but surprisingly it’s the part where Ma Cheon-ah causes a major accident.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While pretending to shoot arrows appropriately, I watched Ma Cheon-ah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cheon-a! Please move around moderately!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That lightning bolt was getting excited because the opposing imugi looked cool, ignoring Yang Pyo who was breaking out in cold sweat trying to cover for her while she ran around wildly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When Woo Sae-geon starts slicing up the imugi with his twin swords, she’ll also get excited seeing that and bounce around more until she gets seriously injured.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything that happens in stages is fully disclosed to the public. And in that particular stage, Ma Cheon-ah suffers severe injuries with her right arm ruptured and half her back covered in burns.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By fire, her own attribute, no less.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, Hae Mi-jun’s anesthesia skill hadn’t manifested, so there was no way to ease Ma Cheon-ah’s pain. Because of this, Ja Hyeong-woo drew up all his energy to heal and broke his limits once more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who became completely cowed after that, ended up bowing her head to Ja Hyeong-woo who had treated her. Ultimately, this entire process was an episode designed to make Ja Hyeong-woo the next leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s an important point where Ma Cheon-ah, who never listened even when others told her to be careful, first feels a threat to her life and grows. It helps Ja Hyeong-woo too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From any angle, it’s beneficial to leave things as they are. So I shouldn’t interfere…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Gang-hyeon hyung, are you alright?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had been spreading stamina heals, suddenly asked me with concern. Only then did I relax my stiffened expression. I shook my head roughly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, this won’t do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I immediately initiated the action I’d thought of.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: Ja Hyeong-woo
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: I’m telling you in advance in case you get strange ideas
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: This isn’t suicide or self-harm
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse Successor: I have a reason for doing this and I absolutely won’t get hurt
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wrote “Don’t worry…” then suddenly got goosebumps and immediately deleted it. What was I about to say something so cringeworthy to Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I glanced back at Ja Hyeong-woo, he seemed to have read the chat. While Ja Hyeong-woo stared at me with wide eyes, I turned toward Ma Cheon-ah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I briefly considered whether to talk through chat so people wouldn’t hear, or risk connecting communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Right, I’m a delinquent. Getting cursed at by people asking what I’m doing is nothing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To maximize the effect, I decided to use communication. Ma Cheon-ah had to accept my incoming communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The communication connected. Even from a distance, I could see Ma Cheon-ah’s face was completely crumpled as if facing something bizarre.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let me give her a proper shock. Like I did when we went to gate practice before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t want to see that young kid get hurt. So I’ll mess up the events, but I’ll still give her the realization.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ma Cheon-ah, it’s time you slowly learned how to act carefully.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before Ma Cheon-ah could get angry, I continued with my next words first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your position is the east side, right? Are you covering the monsters there?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was a pointed remark since I knew she wasn’t doing it at all. I nodded with my chin toward my right side, which was completely empty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So far no comrades have gotten seriously hurt or died, and there weren’t any people weak enough to get hurt because of you in the first place, so you probably don’t realize.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I recited calmly. Ma Cheon-ah’s rotting expression gradually became strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She must have noticed that the situation was somehow odd.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you know what? I’m different. I could really die.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, the daughter of an athletic family with a more comic-like personality than actual comics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who was from a sports high school and preparing for Taekwondo studies, had never had weak people around her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So she wouldn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That the weight of mistakes made while showing off here doesn’t end with just herself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What can I do? I ended up not dying and staying alive until now. Since I’ve decided never to die even for Ja Hyeong-woo’s sake, the people around me will have to bear the losses.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Targeting the moment when Hae Mi-jun and Ja Hyeong-woo were busy healing, right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having finished my meaningful warning, I walked step by step toward the empty east side. Completely bare except for my black durumagi fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shit…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The imugi over there immediately saw me. The one closest to me brought down a hot fireball from the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The space above my head instantly turned bright red. Ma Cheon-ah screamed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
