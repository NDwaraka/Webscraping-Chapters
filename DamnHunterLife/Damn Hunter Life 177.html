</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blue waves peeled away the pain layer by layer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon opened his eyes and took in the dim warehouse scenery. He was still lying face down with his head turned to the left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Am I seeing things?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment he felt the illusion that time had rewound. To a not-so-distant past.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Closest to him, Ja Hyeong-woo, who had finished healing, withdrew his hand and turned his head before their eyes could meet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it had only been Ja Hyeong-woo, he would have thought it was quite an unpleasant illusion. The problem was those 8 people crowding over there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They didn’t care at all that Beom I-ryeong looked exactly like a human. They skillfully surrounded him so there was no escape route and threw multiple weapons as if Beom I-ryeong were a target board. They looked overheated beyond normal, making Yoon Sae-geon frown.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even so, hardly any skills were coming out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They must be saving them for the stage. On the leader’s orders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho trampled on Beom I-ryeong’s face while making eye contact with Yoon Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “List out one by one how hyung got hurt and why he got hurt.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon’s gaze touched the gasping Beom I-ryeong. Beom I-ryeong had a large needle stuck in the middle of his waist and couldn’t move his lower body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let me hear you say it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon’s gaze moved to Sa Ye-ho’s front covered in blood and the hand casually holding a reddened dagger. His mouth slowly opened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Motorcycle inexperienced driving.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A stupid light instantly flowed across Sa Ye-ho’s fierce face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the successors were driving the fake tiger into a corner to hunt it, Gyeon Gang-hyeon wasn’t joining in and was watching from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The vividly clear truth was shaking his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m the same existence as spirit monsters.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that’s why ghosts keep acting familiar, why I can touch soul stones, and why Beom I-ryeong felt kinship and kept bothering me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Hyeon-ah. What should I do with you.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If this was the reason why in some future of the original work, Ja Hyeong-woo said meaningful words with a face that seemed confused?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Future Ja Hyeong-woo definitely met dead Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then is now different from the original work?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because I didn’t die, because I tried hard, because I opened all my power—is it different from that original work back then?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He soon shook his head and focused on the situation. While Gyeon Gang-hyeon had stopped giving orders, the scene before his eyes was becoming more and more excessive suppression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ghosts without magic stones and no vital points just had to be beaten all over to weaken them. Scattering their energy to make them disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the attacks the successors were making on Beom I-ryeong felt similar. However, Beom I-ryeong had the annoying trick of gathering his energy back together even after it was all scattered, perhaps due to his persistent vitality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, let’s try your method. Take out the gourd.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To prevent the annoying resurrection, Gyeon Gang-hyeon made him use Ja Hyeong-woo’s skill that he’d used before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Bottle That Contained Medicinal Wine (Water Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong, whose form was ruined from being dug up to death, couldn’t resist Ja Hyeong-woo’s skill. The gourd sucked in the tattered Beom I-ryeong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash! The gourd shattered to pieces in Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the surroundings became quiet, a sigh came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now he’s really dead. Let’s never see him again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When everything was over and they looked around the old warehouse, the headcount was ’10 people.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow it felt like they’d become complete. Gyeon Gang-hyeon grinned as he looked back at Yoon Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How do you feel about seeing us again?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The young successors still seemed unable to forget the old Woo Sae-geon. They had stiffened and were avoiding his gaze. Only Gyeon Gang-hyeon twisted his lips and teased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon expressionlessly adjusted his clothes with light touches.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s pretend we didn’t see each other.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What a boring person. Gyeon Gang-hyeon told Sa Ye-ho to escort Yoon Sae-geon home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The school boundary is broken anyway… Jump well so you don’t get caught on surveillance cameras or anything. Got it? If Yoon Sae-geon is slow, carry him or something.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon was displeased and Sa Ye-ho was delighted with giggles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A little later, a text from Yoon Sae-geon flew to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Explain later how you got out of school]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today has been a very long day. Even after Sa Ye-ho returned to school, the successors didn’t disperse to their respective homes but stayed gathered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now explain.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon urged me from the front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why are there so many people telling me to explain? I grumbled only internally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Everyone was shocked when I first said Beom I-ryeong was fake too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong… the Jangsan Tiger that they already knew had been killed twice—how was it alive again? What did the things it said mean?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I told them about what had happened so far.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Beom I-ryeong was trying to remove me from the Twelve Zodiac. Or else eliminate Ja Hyeong-woo who’s treating me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This much was the part everyone knew from hearing about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But regarding the detailed inside story, until now only I and Ja Hyeong-woo knew, keeping it secret from others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s strange is that even though killing me would be faster, it said to ‘follow.’ It cornered me but didn’t kill me. It has another purpose.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since even I don’t know everything perfectly, the story was vague. Somehow when it ended, the team members had gathered in a tighter circle around me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are the monsters trying to steal your power?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui threw out a hypothesis with a deeply thoughtful face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m also assuming something like that for now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Myo Cho-hui’s guess was more plausible than my dangerous hypothesis, I roughly agreed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, Won Ha-ri, and Hae Mi-jun had noticeably worried expressions. Won Ha-ri gripped my hand tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon oppa shouldn’t enter stages.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But what if that’s what the monster intends?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sharp voice popped out without me realizing. The little ones got a bit scared at that. I went “oops” and gently redirected my words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “My role can’t be replaced anyway. The situation won’t improve just because I drop out of the clearing team.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beom I-ryeong wanted me to break the system and become an alien existence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then does that mean they’re all in cahoots?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no family or friends, so there was no one in Korea worth taking hostage. But that Jangsan Tiger bastard even found Yoon Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As a result, the boundary separating Hunter School, Korea’s first gate, from the outside was destroyed. I checked, but it didn’t seem like it would reattach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What the hell did I do?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While rummaging through the status window because the aftermath was overwhelming, I suddenly remembered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s not just successors who are trapped in school.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And at that moment, the status window blinked. A notification from just a few seconds ago popped up precariously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /Departure confirmed.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /Departure confirmed.
 </b>
</p>

  /Departure confirmed.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Students were carrying out mass escapes, wondering ‘what happened?’ Once the fence collapsed, everyone went “waaaaah” and escaped beyond it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Uh… huh? While staring dumbfounded at only the status window, I was belatedly shocked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come baaack!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I screamed like calling runaway dogs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunters can go outside Hunter School. They can even return home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What all students and their families had so desperately wished for since Hunter School’s early days had magically come true.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if that happens overnight, and when everyone has already adapted to gate dispatches centered around the school?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is total chaos.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After forcibly summoning all students back to school, I put up a bullet-fast general announcement. I wrote it hastily but roughly included all the important content.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Succeeded in releasing the system’s constraints, but need some time for stabilization, so I’ll prepare for 3 days then send you out in shifts.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After sending all the announcements, only then did a sigh rush out. It feels like somehow hastily plugging a dam that was about to burst and overflow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the work isn’t finished yet. An external announcement is also needed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And the announcement has to be made through the Association.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Multiple pairs of eyes kept watching me struggling while looking at empty air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grinned at my team members.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s go have some fun somewhere.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Korean Hunter Association building I was seeing in person for the first time was magnificent. It looked even cooler at night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing it in a situation where we were about to barge in recklessly, it was even more splendid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I brought my left arm ‘Chattering Mouth That Never Rests’ Sa Ye-ho and my right arm ‘Scariest-Looking Healer in the World’ Ja Hyeong-woo and kicked open the Association President’s office door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kim Jae-moon spat out the tea he was drinking. He stared at us with bulging eyes as if he’d seen a ghost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slapped my hand on Kim Jae-moon’s frozen desk. I grinned and opened my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, long time no see. Have you been well? Oh my, I didn’t know your complexion was this bad in person.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho didn’t even need to add atmosphere from the side. I swaggered and made Kim Jae-moon’s face turn deathly pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo quietly said ‘like gangsters’ from behind. However, since he was also contributing greatly to looking like a gangster with his own bulk, he had no right to say such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To conclude, Kim Jae-moon shriveled up without making a peep as soon as he saw the successors in person. He had to grant all our demands. While summoning the entire Association staff this night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It wasn’t intentional but… did I succeed in crushing Kim Jae-moon ajeossi’s spirit with this?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, I secured tremendous popular support from the students through this incident.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t particularly announce it as something I did, but when I came to my senses, it was already known among hunters through word of mouth. Now students practically worshipped me as a god.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage 11 was really imminent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few days before entering the big stage, I gave the successors unprecedented special treatment with the special ability I’d recently gained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gave them a day off. I sent the successors back so they could spend time with their families.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Twelve Zodiac that had been gathered in one place temporarily returned to their original birthplaces. As someone’s son, daughter, or friend.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I had nowhere to go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no family and no acquaintances.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after receiving a precious day off, the other successors kept glancing at me and hesitating. They were concerned that I was staying at school with nowhere to go. Since they were being considerate and not going, I felt more awkward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ja Hyeong-woo stepped forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not going either. I’m not particularly close with my guardian. I don’t really want to go meet them.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then everyone heard that Ja Hyeong-woo was staying too and just left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘These bastards.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Sa Ye-ho, Ma Cheon-ah, and others found out about our relationship one by one, now it seems like all the successors have caught on. I thought I was hiding it…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Some aren’t interested, some occasionally look with strange eyes but don’t mention it, some giggle. These damn guys without a single prejudice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing what I was thinking inside, in the school with just the two of us, Ja Hyeong-woo followed around behind me like a big dog.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned my head sharply. Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t even surprised and met my gaze with sparkling eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s all because of this bastard.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hit his solar plexus with my elbow with a thud. This guy’s solar plexus was also hard, so I hurt more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though there was no way it hurt, Ja Hyeong-woo bent his body. I wondered why, then saw he was checking if my elbow was bruised.
 </span>
