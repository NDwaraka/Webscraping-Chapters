  ‘Mental Power stat.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I didn’t finish reading the original work, I ultimately didn’t see the foreshadowing about Mental Power stats.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Woo Sae-geon and the meeting room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wondered if other successors would be gathered too, but soon realized the Stage 30 feedback meeting would have already finished without me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since there are no injured, we’ll do the feedback meeting right away. Rest comes after.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I’m too sleepy to endure it, so just do it without me……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I escaped on my own feet, truly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being sick isn’t a crime, but that’s my situation and I am guilty. Woo Sae-geon must feel sorry that I’m such a weakling who collapses and breaks at every turn. If only my physical condition weren’t like this, he would have ground me to dust long ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Since the feedback meeting is over too…… thinking everyone would be resting, there’s a high probability Woo Sae-geon is alone in the meeting room.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I briefly imagined what would follow. A scholar who looks like he wouldn’t bleed even if stabbed sits alone in a meeting room chair, I enter and stand before him. Starting with receiving his questioning……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My life would always have that human’s surveillance and supervision, receiving training pressure four times a day and getting eight messages asking if there’s progress in developing other attribute skills and having Woo Sae-geon personally grab my collar six times daily……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just thinking about it makes me smile naturally. A smile of enlightenment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I shouldn’t go.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I instinctively sensed it. This is the crossroads of my life right now. I had to make the right choice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That human Woo Sae-geon either doesn’t have a phone or has never taken out his phone even once. Not just in front of me, but in front of others too. Therefore, the means of contact with the leader was always through the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I attempted communication with Woo Sae-geon while sitting at the dining table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He did receive my contact, but.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Meeting room.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He immediately hung up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I smiled bitterly while calling again. He answered this time too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m recuperating at home so I called.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Recuperating?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An upturn at the end that clearly showed displeasure. The dark shadow cast over Woo Sae-geon’s eyes naturally came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Is this a call you’re making after organizing what you need to say to me?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All of Woo Sae-geon’s words to others are premised on a mindset that regards the other person as emotional and immature, unable to take care of themselves. And Woo Sae-geon doesn’t bother hiding this from the other person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Appropriately suited to crush the spirits of those who are plentiful in Hunter School and actually young and immature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Facing a person who had carved the intention to control others into all his actions, expressions, and language, I tried to keep my voice as light as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How much, what should I say?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Affinity for other attributes.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not sure about that either…… it just happened somehow.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Saying this would make Woo Sae-geon unpleasant even without facing him directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you don’t want to hear kids rambling, why don’t you just ask them to write reports with introduction, body, and conclusion.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But regarding this issue, I really have nothing to say either. After awakening, I can see others’ attributes – what am I supposed to do about it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“……Every day just brings more work. Just how much time do I have to pour into this bastard.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon muttered to himself. But I guarantee, Woo Sae-geon only mutters things he wants others to hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Also, I need to know to what level of intense activity your body can handle.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He must be talking about combat. He can’t risk putting me in a gate only to have me come out as a corpse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the conclusion seems to be, just teleport to the meeting room or training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “As the leader saw, I have extremely limited stamina for fighting.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finding practical use in other attribute affinity, getting familiar with my body. Both require deep research.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll research it myself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I have no intention of giving Woo Sae-geon my leash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s an ability only I have and only I understand, so what would change if the leader puts his head together with mine? And I don’t think showing everything to the leader is an obligation? Instead, if I discover something big, I’ll report it. Since you’re the leader who forms strategy teams.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What this means is, I’m saying I won’t go under Woo Sae-geon but become a freelancer who occasionally receives stage and gate-related contracts from Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader, it’s true that you’ve done well with strategies even without me. Do you want to spend precious time on someone like me? Use it for bigger things.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expect Woo Sae-geon to understand the hidden meaning in my words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Woo Sae-geon still insists on managing and supervising me even after I’ve said this much—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This would mean Woo Sae-geon admits that the current successors’ military strength is insufficient and he needs me because of that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘In the original work, there was no successor named Gang-hyeon to begin with. Originally, I shouldn’t have been here.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s lips faintly exhaled air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Don’t pull any tricks.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon doesn’t bother decorating or beating around the bush with his words, so this part is comfortable. I listened to his words while grinning broadly, thinking of Woo Sae-geon being right in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Currently, using you brings more harm than benefit. As you said, I don’t care if you’re not there. I’ve never even thought about there being a Dog successor until now.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He truly sounded like he didn’t miss me one bit and had no regrets about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I might not send you out to stages and gates at all from now on. Do you know what happens then?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What happens?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“There’ll be trouble with your retirement compensation.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, my spine went cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since possessing this body, there hadn’t been many occasions to feel such sensation, so the chill was greater.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It doesn’t seem like a simple threat. This is the first thing Woo Sae-geon has seen through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That no matter how unpredictably and capriciously I’ve been acting, ultimately I’m moving with post-retirement life as my goal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, so this becomes my weakness. My heart sank. The silence originating from me exceeded one second.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I carefully parted my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Retirement compensation is really important to me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s no point trying to evade here, it would just become more ridiculous. I judged it better to honestly acknowledge my weakness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then just watch from afar. Whether I become someone worthy of compensation or not.”
 </span>
