<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had been three days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strength returned to the arm that had an IV needle inserted until yesterday. Color came back to his bloodless eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon opened his eyes on his own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first thing his dim, hazy pupils recognized.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s expression brightened when their eyes met where his gaze reached.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A large hand suddenly appeared before his eyes. Gang-hyeon quietly watched Ja Hyeong-woo’s approaching hand, then gently closed his eyes when the hand touched his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The large hand checked his forehead, then slowly caressed his face along his cheek. Gang-hyeon’s eyelids slowly closed and opened. His brow smoothed as if enjoying the stroking touch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was entranced by the sight. The next moment, he felt a sudden tension.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Gang-hyeon. Can you tell me who I am?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did an annoyed expression cross Gang-hyeon’s face. A dry, cracked voice leaked out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo let out a light sigh. He helped Gang-hyeon sit up and gave him a few sips of water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just sitting up left him breathless. He struggled to swallow the water that Ja Hyeong-woo held to his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who docilely accepted his touch, looked too gaunt and haggard even to be examined with just one’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo took the finished cup and set it down. The arm that had been supporting his back pulled Gang-hyeon’s waist closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he bent his tree-trunk-like torso, their chests gently touched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wrapped both arms around Gang-hyeon’s body. With his eyes closed, he used his whole body to remember the other’s heartbeat and breathing, the proof that he was alive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who seemed a little startled, obediently rested his cheek on his shoulder. Though it was just an embrace, his entire body grew warm without any gaps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before long, he dozed off in Ja Hyeong-woo’s arms. Ja Hyeong-woo’s arms gently patted his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Want to try eating some porridge?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he didn’t refuse, Ja Hyeong-woo sat on the bed and spoon-fed him porridge that had been cooled to the right temperature, little by little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed like a different person. Was it because he had no strength at all? The way he obediently opened his mouth small and accepted the food.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon silently chewed what was in his mouth. Whether he knew that Ja Hyeong-woo was pleased with each spoonful that went in or not, he remained dazed throughout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t a good sign. If he had even a little energy, he would have constantly grumbled or stubbornly insisted on doing it himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I made the porridge. Is it edible?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You never really liked porridge. Would it be better if I heated up some sikhye instead? Sikhye is hot when you first make it, you know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even without responses, he kept talking to him. The quiet voice that casually said anything was quite chatty. If someone else saw this, they would doubt whether this was really Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It snowed outside. It’s the first snow I’ve seen at school. It would have been nice to see it with you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What was there wasn’t ‘Ja Hyeong-woo’ but Han Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had been laid back down on the bed, suddenly mumbled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……The status window is quiet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo propped his arm beside his head and leaned down. He listened carefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since I’m the student council president…… notifications should come. I can’t hear them. Can’t see them…… Have I become strange? Is this a dream?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was already half asleep. Even as his voice gradually diminished, memories from the depths of his mind continued to be dragged out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about school? The people outside? The stage……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo exhaled deeply in two parts. He stroked Gang-hyeon’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Other people are watching over the school. Rest more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon doesn’t know even in his dreams. What kind of existence he has become in Korea right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’ll be very confused, so it would be better not to tell him for a while and let him focus on recovery.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon felt the touch caring for him even in his sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he came to his senses, Ja Hyeong-woo was beside him. Every time he woke up, he would eat a few spoonfuls of porridge and fall asleep again repeatedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he sat up half-awake, Ja Hyeong-woo would place a pillow behind his back. He never once refused the spoon that fed him. He said he cooked different porridge each meal, but he couldn’t really taste it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he stepped his feet under the bed to go to the bathroom, an arm immediately came to his side. When he tried to lie down again right after coming back, Ja Hyeong-woo stopped him. Saying he needed to digest, so he couldn’t lie down for at least 20 minutes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So when they sat side by side on the bed with his waist resting against Ja Hyeong-woo’s arm, he would unknowingly doze off and rest his small head on the shoulder beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiet time as if only the two of them, himself and Ja Hyeong-woo, existed in the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wasn’t aware of anyone else’s presence at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t that there really wasn’t anyone, but thanks to Ja Hyeong-woo thoroughly controlling who came and went.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He only occasionally let others come to see Gang-hyeon’s sleeping face when he was asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To Gang-hyeon, the other successors are closer to objects of responsibility. If they’re nearby, he won’t be able to rest properly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One afternoon, the head buried deep in the pillow fell completely asleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quietly stood up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He stood in the doorway facing the direction where Gang-hyeon lay. He stood back-to-back with someone standing outside the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……You probably know the story about how Gang-hyeon initially ran away when awakening was imminent.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t see it directly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho muttered in an uncharacteristically low tone. The sound flowed in through the door crack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But what does that have to do with anything now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s still sleeping too much. It’s not just a physical problem. He seems mentally depressed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo with a dark face stared at the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why I’m saying this. Gang-hyeon battled illness for over 7 years, and even after awakening, he couldn’t escape from bodily pain. He was actually afraid of hunter work too. ……I think he might have reached his limit now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was even considering having Gang-hyeon stop fighting and retreat to the rear. Of course, he would have to ask his opinion first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person beyond the door, as if seeing through Ja Hyeong-woo’s inner thoughts, asked a question that skipped several steps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Will you enter stages even without Gyeon Gang-hyeon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a pointed question asking if he would work hard even in places without him. Ja Hyeong-woo responded coldly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll approach it more desperately than you, so mind your own business.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grumbled and cursed something. Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t even listen and flipped through his status window screens.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an interview request sent by the association. He had ignored it for three days while staying by Gang-hyeon’s side, and at this rate, they would probably bring lawyers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo irritably grabbed the doorknob and pushed the door forcefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to that, only Sa Ye-ho, who had been leaning against the outer door, tumbled over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Watch over Gang-hyeon while I’m gone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had no interest whether Sa Ye-ho fell or not. Sa Ye-ho, who flexibly regained his balance, immediately glared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fucking asshole asking for favors.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s impatient eyes were still fierce.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just touch him or play around and wake him up. I’ll make sure it gets posted online as a violence incident.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow…… using your brain for once. Fucking bastard with a rotten personality.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo passed by without even responding. Sa Ye-ho was dumbfounded and stared at the retreating back of his head for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seriously wanted to punch him, but soon remembered. That Ja Hyeong-woo’s mental state was completely messed up right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m the normal one who has to endure this. Ugh, fuck.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He quietly closed the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he had turned once, Gang-hyeon was lying on his side facing this way. His cheeks were so hollow that his flesh didn’t even press against the sheets. Sa Ye-ho, looking down at the haggard face, chuckled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Our puppy. Your fate is rough, and your boyfriend’s temper is dog-like too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lightly ignoring Ja Hyeong-woo’s warning not to touch him, he tapped the round forehead with his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He climbed onto the bed. Sitting with both legs dangling down, he looked at his phone. His free left hand naturally pressed beside him, and small breaths near his wrist touched his skin. Even knowing this, Sa Ye-ho didn’t bother to move his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Muted game effects exploded on his phone screen. Sa Ye-ho’s right thumb moved busily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Too absorbed in the game, he didn’t even notice that Gang-hyeon had opened his eyes behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after waking up, his vision didn’t become clear. Gang-hyeon blinked his sleepy eyes. Then he discovered the large hand in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was similarly large in size, but the skin was much paler. However, his drowsy eyes couldn’t properly see that difference. He moved his weak arm and pulled that hand toward him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The warm hand flinched slightly but obediently followed. Gang-hyeon buried it between his chin and collarbone. He curled up his body slightly and closed his eyes again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Oh my.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho didn’t pull his hand away and snorted. Game over appeared on his phone screen, but he had already lost interest in that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From then on, he docilely left his hand there and kept looking toward the door. When would Ja Hyeong-woo come back quickly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before long, his waiting bore fruit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze, upon opening the door, was deeply fixed on one spot. To Sa Ye-ho’s eyes, he looked like a beast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you holding it?”
 </span>
</p>
