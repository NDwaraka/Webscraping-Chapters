  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 174
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, in southern Seoul, dozens of kilometers away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gate here was already in a state where the boss monster had escaped through the entrance. It was quite troublesome with the boss hiding somewhere in the city.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri sprinted quickly through the alley with dozens of blades behind her back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A dragon with a divine appearance even in semi-transparent form charged low beside her, following Won Ha-ri. Jin Seol-woon, who was riding with his upper body pressed close to the dragon’s body, shouted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ssi, has the boss’s location been identified?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Narrowing down candidates. Catch the mobs in front first!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clatter! Several metal blades embedded in the monster’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Here……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then someone’s voice flowed from the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri only realized Sa Ye-ho had moved in that direction after hearing the voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho rushed forward then stopped abruptly. His eyes traced the nearby street address signs and scenery.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ding, at that moment the status window vibrated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had finally identified the boss’s location, sent a map. Won Ha-ri checked it first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho sunbae-nim! Moving toward the boss monster……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As she spoke and turned her head, the red figure that should have been there had disappeared without a trace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s gone!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon also lost Sa Ye-ho despite watching with both eyes open. It was the voice from beyond the communication that calmed the panicking Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“That bastard’s too fast to find you. I’m following the location for now, so just you two move. We’ll meet anyway since we’re going to catch the boss.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After casually giving orders, Gang-hyeon, who confirmed the address of where they were once more, let out a hollow laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Right, where else would you be chasing to?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While there was a noisy team with the leader’s concentrated care overlapping with a team member’s impulsive actions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was also an extremely silent practice team that only did their own work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Swoosh! A sword with a blade as large as a rogue’s sword cut the monster in half.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh, the flames dwelling in the sword ignited everywhere Ma Cheon-ah passed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And before the flames could transfer to brick floors or sculptures, thin waves gently covered those places and extinguished them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire and water are opposing attributes. However, since Ma Cheon-ah’s combat style and attributes were likely to turn the surroundings into a wasteland, Gang-hyeon attached Ja Hyeong-woo to Ma Cheon-ah only for mainland Korea deployments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The healer of the combat team formed this way was currently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“……Monster 50m ahead!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at the scene with a robot-like blank face, then brightening up and raising his head whenever Gang-hyeon’s voice was heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the voice was no longer heard, he returned to his emotionless expression and did his work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah watched that sight in disbelief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He should just go be with the Leader. What’s he doing here?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, she didn’t voice her criticism out loud. This was unusual for Ma Cheon-ah, who liked giving orders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Ma Cheon-ah spotted the large boss monster ahead. However, since she had flown on Chollima, Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t behind her. He had been left behind due to slow speed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon didn’t miss that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Don’t rush ahead, go in with Ja Hyeong-woo! While watching the water skills!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know too. The nagging is.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boss monster, which hadn’t noticed Ma Cheon-ah yet, was crunching and eating building debris with its nape fully exposed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though impatient, Ma Cheon-ah gritted her teeth and obediently waited for Ja Hyeong-woo like a horse tied to a rope. Broadcast drones buzzed around Ma Cheon-ah and the boss monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Around that time, somewhere in Korea, Ma Cheon-ah’s parents, safe in their home, were watching their only daughter’s fight through live news.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were also quite extraordinary people like Ma Cheon-ah, so even when monster blood and flesh splattered from the sword their daughter wielded, they made absurd comments instead of worrying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “My goodness, our child has grown up. She knows to endure without rushing in. Did you see her waiting just now? Is it because of that big boy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, no. Isn’t it thanks to that pretty child named Gang-hyeon? It seems like it’s been since he changed, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Gang-hyeon was at school with another successor who likewise remained on standby.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re the last bastion with me. If gate cleanup is delayed, we’ll go out to replace the tired ones.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though his answer was still energetic and his eyes sparkled, a slightly wiser and more mature light flowed compared to before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon stared at him blankly then suddenly smiled faintly. Hae Mi-jun was a little surprised by this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung, why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s nothing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems you’re graduating from me now too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One road in Seoul had an eerie atmosphere flowing with all people having evacuated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, should I say ‘almost’ everyone evacuated?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huff, gasp!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One man who couldn’t escape to a safe place in time hastily got out of his stalled car and ran.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind him, one vicious life form that wasn’t human chased him, drooling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he might trip over the ground at any moment, the man staggered but kept running. Nevertheless, the monster’s hands only got closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man, who had been running while constantly looking back, finally fell.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh, huaaak!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud—!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right at that moment, a gleaming black bike violently rammed into the monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hi, hiik.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man forced his weakened legs to move and fled, but couldn’t believe what he saw with his own eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because even though there was an accident where the bike’s front was horribly crushed, it made no sense for the driver to get off the bike as if nothing happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A tsk sound echoed from inside the black helmet. It was while looking at the dead bike, not the monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monster that had fallen got up, spitting out a Grrr…… angry cry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The helmeted figure’s head slowly turned toward the monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not just bikes, but even guns and swords couldn’t pierce that hide. The hands of one who was once Korea’s top hunter were no different now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, he had no intention of backing down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The furious monster approached making thudding sounds. He grabbed a nearby traffic sign pipe with both hands and pushed it up strongly. Crack—! Concrete and ground were pulled up together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I can’t pierce or wound the hide.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was only one place Yoon Sae-geon aimed for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He lightly held the pulled-out sign like a spear and waited patiently even as the monster grabbed him with its hands to lift him up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right now, until the monster opened its maw wide toward him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tip of the ‘No U-Turn’ sign thrust into the monster’s mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kweee—! The monster’s scream echoed throughout the area. Dodging the flailing arms, Yoon Sae-geon persistently shoved the pipe into the monster’s stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the sensation at his fingertips, he was certain that the sign he thrust in had pierced through the throat and passed through several organs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The monster thrashed about, frothing at the mouth with Grrr— sounds. Yoon Sae-geon, who had shoved the sign all the way to the head without leaving anything, dropped down and rolled on the ground before getting up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having this physical ability yet sitting in a shelter with other people also looked unseemly, so he had just taken the bike to go home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t particularly intend to save anyone, but if his juniors were unreliable, he himself had to fulfill his responsibilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They’re late. Is it because the Leader is in that state?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though other monsters appeared, there was no sign of hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both monsters looked at Yoon Sae-geon. Grrr, they bared all their yellow, hideous teeth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s when it happened. Bright red fire that shot up from somewhere directly hit the monster’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he had lost his penetrating eyes, Yoon Sae-geon could tell immediately upon seeing it. The form and trail of that crimson flame, that power that burned cheerfully and wouldn’t be extinguished.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From his tensely strained arms, strength slowly drained away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whoops.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly his body floated up. Yoon Sae-geon stiffened his jaw slightly inside the helmet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Arms that looked thin compared to him had lifted Yoon Sae-geon up like a princess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he closed and opened his eyes, he was in front of the shelter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a speed that he, now a civilian, couldn’t follow with his eyes. Yoon Sae-geon newly felt the gap between himself and Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sir, you weren’t hurt, were you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Once Yoon Sae-geon stood on the ground with both feet, the eye level of the one asking sociably came down below his own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had been wearing a helmet all this time. Moreover, dressed in thick padding suitable for winter weather and even wearing a scarf, his tattoos weren’t visible either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wrapped up to that extent, would anyone recognize him? He hadn’t even said a word yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The helmet man substituted his expression of intent by just nodding his head slightly. He tried to slip into the shelter, but…….
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been behind him, was somehow standing in front of him now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sir, I can’t let you through without verbal confirmation.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One-sided persistent conversation continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s eyes carefully examined the round helmet. There was definitely laughter at the end of his words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sir, please just say one word. Are you really okay? Are you feeling very bad? Can’t you even say one word? Were you perhaps very scared? We should have rescued you faster, I’m sorry. Sir—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually the helmet man stopped without being able to move even one step.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A low voice suppressing anger was finally dragged out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go follow and catch the boss.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grinned, showing all his neat teeth. He tilted his head to take a pretty angle and looked up at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Show me your face. I’ll go if I see it. Hm? Hm?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Sae-geon knew that a couple of reporters at the shelter were looking this way. Their cameras were filming in this direction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoo, a long and irritated sigh echoed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Annoying bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hand, lifted with restrained movement, slowly lifted the helmet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Pale sunlight embraced in turn his nape, slightly moist with sweat, his cool-colored skin, and his hair tied up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s smile became so intense that it seemed like the corners of his mouth had become fixed that way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
