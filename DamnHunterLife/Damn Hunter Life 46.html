  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 46
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first thing I saw was my hair scattered on the wooden floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How did I lose consciousness? Now I’m even passing out in the middle of talking.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My temple touching the floor felt cold. I waited obediently without getting up right away to deal with low blood pressure, and at the edge of my vision I could see someone’s crouched knees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Yang Pyo with a stern expression. Even seeing that I was awake, Yang Pyo didn’t say much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you were going to bring me here, you should have laid me on a bed. My arm is numb…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Don’t you understand the situation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did I look around at the gloomy voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was my house. However, it wasn’t the living space but the storage room. The only door was firmly closed and Yang Pyo’s large back was blocking it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo had put me down in an empty corner and blocked the door with his threatening bulk, trapping me inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crucially, the phone with the recorded conversation was also in Yang Pyo’s hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can’t leave until I let you go. Got it? I’m being honest – if we get into a physical fight, it’ll be harder for me not to hurt you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Speaking rather ominously, Yang Pyo had a more resolute gaze than ever before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Yang Pyo, this bastard—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You wrote a script for what to say while I was unconscious, didn’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, really…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ultimate coward tried to act tough. I giggled without any sense of tension. Yang Pyo got annoyed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I knew you wouldn’t be scared, but I wish you’d at least have some sense of danger.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether he complained or not, I felt very cheerful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s kidnapping, not fainting! I didn’t just faint by myself. I’m happy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You should have tied me up if you wanted to do this. If you want to make it realistic, you should have tied me up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat up. I raised both arms and pretended to be tied to the wall. Yang Pyo’s incredulous gaze followed my spread arm joints.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reaction was funny, but this position would make my arms hurt, so I decided to try self-bondage in a different way. I knelt down and put my hands behind my back. Yang Pyo looked down at me in amazement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t do that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you say don’t, I shouldn’t. It’s a kidnapper’s demand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s jaw twitched. Though he was the one who had confined me, his resolve was crumbling at a rapid pace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He doesn’t even have the guts to threaten anyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, he did use his head in his own way.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The mindset of confining a kidnapped person in their own house. That’s smart? The only place you can’t escape to even with a return skill is your own home.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strictly speaking, there was also the method of teleporting to another successor, but let’s not point that out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had no reason to run away in the first place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not because Yang Pyo isn’t the type to harm me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like Yang Pyo is trying to silence me even while doing this, I still have things to talk about with Yang Pyo too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But why couldn’t you do anything against your friend earlier? …Is he really a friend?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I brought the topic back to the starting point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who realized who I was talking about, avoided my gaze. Still, unlike earlier, he seemed to have collected himself somewhat and was quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he had calmed down too, it seemed okay to make progress.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What can you do? You can’t hit my head with a hammer to erase my memory. So tell me the whole story. With just the conversation I heard, the information is limited, so I might misunderstand you badly. But Yang Pyo, you’re not someone who would do bad things.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While approaching as a stranger, I chose the most gentle expressions possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This matter was a sensitive topic from the start. If this were ordinary Korean society, it would be something to consider telling a teacher about, or calling the police.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, he carries the fate of being a successor. I, as an outsider, can’t fathom how much Yang Pyo’s insides have been rotting over this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m definitely the one who should be cold, but Yang Pyo was trembling more than me. It didn’t really suit his robust body like a judo athlete.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, with his head deeply bowed, began to stammer out his story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Half wanting to feel relieved by letting out what he’d been suffering alone, half trembling in fear of the consequences of confessing to a third party.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I really, I didn’t know that bastard was like that, and he did have a tendency to speak harshly and unpleasantly… But I really didn’t know he was a school bully, we even went to different high schools…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy with no talent for eloquence rambled the whole time. Yet surprisingly, he explained quite properly from the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His timid and fearful nature, asking Kim Sang-ju for help to improve the phobia and insomnia he got from gates because of that, the weakness that was grasped that way, turning a blind eye to Kim Sang-ju’s behavior because he didn’t want rumors to spread…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Drawing out all of his shameful parts in front of someone else, and in that process facing those things himself, would definitely not be easy. Yang Pyo admirably didn’t stop talking while holding back his surging emotions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And perhaps he had unconsciously taken a step of growth through this, as some of his speech habits that tended to subtly blame others had partially disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He said it all at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s my fault. I was stupidly manipulated by that fucking bastard and made things worse. I should have somehow told people around me when I first saw it…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I neither affirmed nor denied it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I cleared my throat slightly so my voice wouldn’t be buried in Yang Pyo’s anxious breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you say ‘people around you,’ where do you mean?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Oh, the association…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo unconsciously answered his thoughts without understanding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Woo Sae-geon’s name didn’t immediately come up.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strictly speaking, Woo Sae-geon would be someone more reliable in daily life than the association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To properly solve this incident, it would be urgent to find out whether Woo Sae-geon was aware of the despicable acts happening among regular students.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was a situation where I couldn’t rely on the original work. Whether such things didn’t happen in the original, or happened but weren’t shown, they weren’t written about anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in the original work, there wasn’t trivial information like what they ate on which day, who they met, what time they slept. That was natural. The original was a story centered on Ja Hyeong-woo, operating within the scope of what Ja Hyeong-woo knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo seemed to have nothing more to say. So additional questions were my job.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is the insomnia severe?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of opening his mouth, Yang Pyo did something else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Earth energy swirled around Yang Pyo’s face. No, had it been there from the beginning, not just appearing now? When Yang Pyo moved his hand, the earth energy smoothly peeled away following that movement. Like taking off a mask.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I saw Yang Pyo’s real face that he’d been hiding, I was speechless. His eyes were sunken and his dark circles were deep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Are these guys conspiring? Ja Hyeong-woo too, why do they all have mask skills? Who else among the Twelve Zodiac is using one?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo seemed to have given up all pretense in front of me. With a face that said whatever happens happens, he put his skill back on like wearing a mask.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hunter School store doesn’t sell sleeping pills. It seems to classify them as drugs. I was shocked when I searched for them.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about the skill you used to knock me out earlier?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It doesn’t work on myself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then how do you cure insomnia?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunter School has healers, but no psychiatrists. Even if you get examined by an outside doctor remotely, prescription drugs can’t be brought in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Isn’t there anyone among the Twelve Zodiac with sleep skills?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I became lost in thought, the conversation reached a conclusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then it must be time for a conclusion. Yang Pyo looked at me with a devastated expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you going to spread it around?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t beat around the bush.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, before Yang Pyo could jump up, I immediately continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll gather evidence, request a report to the association, and leave the judgment to the people too, making a very noisy public issue of it. That bastard, not you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And while we’re at it, let’s sort out the factional fighting among water attribute hunters all at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo looked conflicted. Looking at his innocent eyes that were on the verge of breaking, I felt a heavy sense of responsibility for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If my voice right now couldn’t give Yang Pyo trust, I might regret the choice I’d made to maintain a delinquent image until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That bastard is trash. You’re not without fault either, but… I see you as a victim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You really tried hard to prevent that bastard from hitting others, even if it meant catering to Kim Sang-ju’s whims. Even helping Kim Sang-ju embezzle points while suppressing your nausea.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo fixed his gaze on me. Those shiny pupils suddenly gave me slight goosebumps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The biggest among the Twelve Zodiac, but a very tender guy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo. Once you have fear, it’s hard to shake it off. Sometimes, external contact is necessary.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was comfort for everything currently tormenting Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why were we faced with such a fate?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Children saving the world – this should have just been a story that only appeared in fairy tales or comics.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “From now on, ignore all of Kim Sang-ju’s contacts and leave it to me once. You’ve suffered alone enough already. Just hand it over. I’d stake my life on not betraying you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The whites of Yang Pyo’s eyes became slightly bloodshot. He bit his lips hard, then carefully nodded while lowering his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Good. With this, I’ve obtained victim number 1’s consent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, regarding other problems, I intended to reach out my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can’t sleep before and after going to gates?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That, yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then you won’t be able to sleep tonight either?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now, thanks to Kim Sang-ju staying by his side at night, he seems to have somehow endured without being discovered by others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But recently, Kim Sang-ju’s help would have disappeared too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if that’s simply a problem of needing someone to be there… wouldn’t I be able to do it too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sleeping at your house tonight. I won’t accept refusal.”
 </span>
</p>
