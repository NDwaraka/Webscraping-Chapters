  Damn Hunter Life Side Story Chapter 6
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I did think about it sometimes during our long-distance relationship and wanted to do it……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I didn’t want it to go as far as being unable to leave the bed for three whole days except for the bathroom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo fed him easily edible food, let him nap briefly, then did that again. One day felt like three days, and three days felt like one day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes when he got too excited and Han Hyeong-woo’s reason flew away to the point where he couldn’t distinguish front from back, he kept thrusting like a beast that truly couldn’t be reasoned with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In his hazy mind, he was sitting on Han Hyeong-woo’s lap, facing him while being penetrated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hheuu……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like being placed dizzyingly on a high peak, his whole body swaying every time he was thrust into. He couldn’t even tell when he had sat on top of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only thing to lean on was Han Hyeong-woo’s body. Cheon Gang-hyeon struggled a bit then soon embraced him tightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His shoulder was wetly soaked with tears and saliva he had shed. Bite marks that seemed to be his own doing were also faintly visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hu……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo let out a long breath. Thud, the hard glans that violently struck inside crushed his sweet spot as if it would collapse it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His vision exploded black. Cheon Gang-hyeon, with his eyes half-rolled back, forgot to breathe and ejaculated trembling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between their bodies where white liquid had pooled and was sloshing around, even thinner semen flowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon’s buttocks convulsed and sucked in the cock tight. In his blurry vision, a large tanned upper body collapsed toward him, then let out a gritted moan by his ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The respite was very short. The large flesh pillar inside Cheon Gang-hyeon’s belly began to stir again and pull as if it would burst his inner walls. Han Hyeong-woo, with sweat drops hanging on his pectoral muscles, bit his nape and continued his hip movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud! He roughly slammed himself into Cheon Gang-hyeon’s inside. Even the sounds by his ear were all wet. Some unidentifiable liquid thoroughly soaked below making squelching sounds. Cheon Gang-hyeon’s limbs shook rapidly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Auk, heu.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was truly the limit. Suffocating sexual sensation came up like being squeezed. Cheon Gang-hyeon flailed his arms with the feeling of trying to escape from the beast devouring him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Heu, eu, stop, slowly……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what good would that do? When the other party wouldn’t listen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just this time… just this time……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed Han Hyeong-woo was equally out of his mind. He made impossible pleas while desperately mounting as if he’d die if he stopped now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His pitiful words were gradually consumed by moans. Cheon Gang-hyeon’s lower belly repeatedly bulged out in the shape of the glans then went back in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it a day ago, or two days ago? Han Hyeong-woo discovered this while continuing sex like a device that had lost its control function.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How frenzied he had been then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With only the single-minded desire to ejaculate, he rubbed that bulging part and randomly pierced inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah, ah, uk, uhk.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Labored moans leaked out as if pushed from the body pierced by the flesh pillar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sounds barely came out from exhaustion, and didn’t even match the rhythm of stirring inside. His voice was all cracked and sunken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, his infinitely sensitized body released something from his urethra. Even though he climaxed, he couldn’t ejaculate properly and only dropped clear water drops from the tip of his cock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Han Hyeong-woo’s movements stop. He shot streams of semen into Cheon Gang-hyeon’s belly while penetrating the panting Cheon Gang-hyeon’s lips with his tongue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether his strength was completely drained, his soft body moved as Han Hyeong-woo led and collapsed against him. Soon Han Hyeong-woo finished ejaculating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had kissed his wet lips repeatedly, opened his eyes and looked at Cheon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His nipples that had been bitten and pinched thoroughly were swollen taut. Congestion of almost the same color as his nipples was also densely spread across his upper body. Gang-hyeon, whose whole body had become tattered, continued sobbing even though intercourse had stopped. Panting as if he had died and come back to life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s hard, I said, hk, I said stop, I.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He cried because it was hard, cried because it felt good, cried because it felt so good it was scary, cried because he was sad that he said stop but it didn’t stop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What day is today? How much sex did we have? His memory was hazy. Suddenly the absurd fear that this might be eternal struck him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Heu, uk, heuk……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had never seen him cry like this even as a child. It was cute and pitiful, and also stimulating. Han Hyeong-woo carefully kissed his crown while being very cautious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Han Hyeong-woo patted and stroked his back, the sniffling gradually subsided after a while. He fell asleep draped over Han Hyeong-woo without warning, unable even to remove the cock stuck in him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo held water in his mouth and kissed to feed Cheon Gang-hyeon water. A sudden surge of guilt rushed over him, so he did the cleanup with particularly more care, wanting to truly end it this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who didn’t even flinch when the semen was removed from his belly by hand, didn’t move even when the sun was in the middle of the sky.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who had returned to being human after three days by putting on clothes from top to bottom, approached the bed. He tried to wake him because he was worried about him sleeping continuously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who couldn’t wake up even when his face was touched for a long time, finally showed a reaction only when his shoulder was shaken. His barely opened eyes had no focus at all. He closed his eyes tightly again and only moved his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Dizzy……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo urgently fed him a few sips of water, then tore soft bread and spread chocolate jam on it. When he put it in his slightly opened mouth, he chewed and swallowed instinctively without tasting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That day Cheon Gang-hyeon fell ill. The major problem Han Hyeong-woo realized was that he no longer had heal skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He could barely move throughout his suffering from muscle pain. Han Hyeong-woo restlessly massaged his thighs and buttocks diligently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Umm……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon made a pained sound and unconsciously stretched his foot backward, touching Han Hyeong-woo’s crotch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His groin was swollen even in that situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon, who jumped up from the bed, didn’t calm his anger for a whole week after that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo knelt and begged, barely managing to reverse Cheon Gang-hyeon’s decision to leave the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though they experienced a crisis from the very beginning of cohabitation……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Living together in the same bed and sharing all of each other’s daily routines settled in smoothly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo was a decent housemate. He was also quite good at housekeeping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He always woke up early at the same time every morning, and had enough leisure to prepare breakfast for Cheon Gang-hyeon every day. He always scrubbed clean the house where two people lived with his surplus energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And even during the time Cheon Gang-hyeon washed dishes or cooked, he couldn’t stand it and often clung to him from the side. It was a bit annoying, but thanks to that, Cheon Gang-hyeon had no time to feel lonely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was a decent boyfriend.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The days had gotten a bit longer compared to when they first started living together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo, who woke up early every morning to go exercise, raised the corners of his mouth as soon as he opened his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The happiness he felt in his recent daily life was at the level where his eyes softened just from waking up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even more so because of the warm and soft body he felt under his arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buried deep in the blanket so his face wasn’t visible, only his slightly grown hair peeked out. Cheon Gang-hyeon was embracing Han Hyeong-woo’s bare upper body with both arms, with one leg wrapped around his waist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I not go exercise?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He soon shook off the temptation and gently freed himself from Cheon Gang-hyeon’s arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cheon Gang-hyeon doesn’t embrace him like this when it hasn’t been long since he was stripped naked and thoroughly taken. He might curl up defensively with his back against the wall while sleeping instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, he’s not heartless enough to suggest separate rooms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a day or two of that, when time passes and his wariness softens again, then he sleeps limply embraced like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Cute.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he comes back from exercise, he strokes Gang-hyeon who is still sleeping, then prepares breakfast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A day he wishes would last forever begins.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I set exactly three rules as conditions for Han Hyeong-woo. For living together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, don’t walk around naked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With this rule, I can also change clothes where Han Hyeong-woo can’t see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Second, don’t come out naked after washing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I get too flustered seeing everything below exposed, it’s a preventive measure to avoid unnecessarily blushing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Last, no touching while I’m sleeping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the number one rule because there’s a prior offense. If broken, we break up that day. When I threatened him, Han Hyeong-woo is doing his best to follow it for now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But what’s the point of not touching while sleeping……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He just has to touch when I’m awake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sluggishly crawled out of bed at 9 AM, just washed my face and went outside the room to find delicious smells spread throughout the house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What the hell did that bastard make for breakfast?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I went to the kitchen, well, it was as expected. A wooden cutting board and dedicated knife were out, and the oven and blender were running simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you sleep well?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo turned to look at me with a bright smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Han Hyeong-woo was holding a small mortar in his hands. Since the pestle he was holding was green, he was probably grinding herbs or something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know. Even when I ask him to keep breakfast simple, he always puts effort into making it like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s also for certification preparation, so I can’t say anything about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
