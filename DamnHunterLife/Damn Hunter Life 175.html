  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 175
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When more than half of Hunter School’s students had gone out, returned exhausted, and were repeatedly alternating with other waiting teams.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong was holed up in his room, trembling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘T-thank goodness. I didn’t get matched…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though more than half a day had passed since the clearing began, there had been no gate notifications looking for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hunters under Gyeon Gang-hyeon who had entered after him were all currently out in the field. Yet he alone remained, just shaking his head frantically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Mom and Dad told me not to do it too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every time he turned on the news, chaotic scenes passed across the screen. He could also see hunters busily moving around sites in disheveled states from handling gates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s not my business, it’s not my business.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He tried hard to believe that. From when he first awakened, he’d continued with the same thought never going out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was peace chosen with an uncomfortable heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If contact with his parents hadn’t suddenly been cut off an hour ago, he would have continued to settle for peace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mom, Dad!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They clearly said they’d safely arrived at the shelter… Kwak Ji-hong’s heart pounded and shook.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both parents’ phones had only been giving dial tones without connecting since earlier. Did they drop their phones? Both of them?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until about 30 minutes later, when he learned that a monster had attacked the phone company, temporarily cutting off that carrier’s service.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For Kwak Ji-hong, it was hellish time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huuk… huff.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong, who had been sniffling and crying, raised his head and wiped his tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the worry filling his head had finally subsided, something stirred in his heart. The muscles that had only been used for trembling somehow twitched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Pathetic. Really pathetic.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also have two legs and arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In his inventory was a short spear used for training that he’d approached like studying—something he didn’t want to do but had to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a spear that looked shabby at first glance and frail like its creator…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But strangely, this spear seemed alive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than the user taming the weapon, the weapon flexibly moved on its own to match the user’s habits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the first time he swung it, the spear gently absorbed Kwak Ji-hong’s clumsy earth energy and regulated it so the power wouldn’t flow backward. Even when Kwak Ji-hong swung it clumsily, it didn’t make even one wrist sore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What abilities would this mysterious spear display if it stabbed monsters in real combat?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Why did you contact me. If you called a busy person, there should be a good enough reason.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh, Kwak Ji-hong gasped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to have unknowingly made a subordinate hunter communication call to the weapon creator. And it was the first time he’d initiated contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His teeth chattered from tension. However, this time Kwak Ji-hong didn’t apologize submissively and hang up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the call had already connected, then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m really lacking, aren’t I? I’ve never been gate matched anyway…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if it originated from a mistake, he spoke the words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person on the other end of the communication was silent for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon guessed Kwak Ji-hong’s confusion. He soon made a decision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It’s not that you didn’t get matched.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He decided to tell him the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I blocked it with my authority.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as those words fell, an unlocked status window appeared above Kwak Ji-hong’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Traces of gate matchings that had been made then canceled, traces of rejected personnel assistance requests… besides that, countless notifications were there. Matching, matching, matching. Past notifications poured out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong looked at his blinking status window with a dumbfounded face. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s voice continued to reach his ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even if your will is tiny as a bean, you have good motor skills and decent learning ability. Most importantly, you’re my direct disciple, though you don’t know it. There’s no other kid I’ve personally looked after for affinity as intensively as you.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gate situation that occurred throughout Korea still hadn’t been completely resolved. Ding, another new matching notification appeared on Kwak Ji-hong’s status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon read that in the other person’s silence, anxiety was decreasing and hesitation was filling its place instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What will you do? Want to go out?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The answer from the person with the most timid personality he’d ever seen was:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Could I… do it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The answer to that question was actually already being given by the system first. The automatic matching system’s notification sound rang noisily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“If you can’t do it, say so.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To Kwak Ji-hong’s ears, that sounded exactly like Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t care at all what he did or didn’t do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“But once you go out, you can’t return until your assigned gate is cleared. I won’t tolerate going there and doing nothing while dragging down other hunters either. If you’re going to disgrace my face, give up.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, an emotion he’d never felt before colored Kwak Ji-hong’s five senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s light tone stirred up resentment. He felt sorry toward him who had no expectations of him, but on the other hand, he was angry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had been sharply awakening him to reality, exhaled once then suddenly changed his tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I got cursed out like hell a year ago too. No matter what you do, you’ll be better than I was. And even if things go wrong, I’ll cover for you.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong wanted to ask him at this moment:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How did you climb from a year ago to the current Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t voice the question. That would really look stupid. Kwak Ji-hong took a deep breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just once, let me break away from being a foolish person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Simulation… I did it every week. I want to try going. I want to try doing it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the other end of the communication, a clear, cool smile appeared at Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although right now he was even getting Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s permission for ‘matching consent’ that he could accept by his own will.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong would change even more in the future.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep—Suddenly alarm sounds overlapped from Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A comment appeared before his eyes. Slightly tired eyes quickly read through the sentences.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Immediately the fatigue completely disappeared from his pupils. Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had suddenly become alert, unconsciously patted Hae Mi-jun’s arm beside him. He connected communication with someone through his status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Myo Cho-hui. Please return. You’ll switch places with me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprised Hae Mi-jun looked at Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Even in the midst of this, he couldn’t do things like holding the palm that had been placed on his arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry. You stay for now. The boss monster’s location is a bit screwed up. I think we’ll have to drill through the ground to get there. Yang Pyo and I will go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang! Bang! Outside, the monster’s grotesque arm pounded on the basement level 1 storage room door. The iron door bulged out according to the monster’s arm marks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “P-please save me. Please save me…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong, who had nowhere to go with the only escape route blocked, cried under the desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He shouldn’t have come to school today. Dormitory life was over and it was vacation, so why did he show off saying he’d meet up with classmates at school?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He resented the dean who had stuck the art college up on a mountain. He also resented that the storage room was underground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among them, he resented even more that monster that had dug through the ground like a mole, discovered underground prey, and even broke through the wall to enter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And most of all, he resented the hunters who hadn’t come to help yet more than anything in the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something came halfway through the iron door. Park Ho-gyeong made a “hyaak!” sound and collapsed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the monster’s arm had finally broken through the door. He squeezed his eyes shut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But… suddenly the surroundings became quiet. Unbelievably quiet for a monster having squeezed its body into the storage room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong gulped. He stealthily looked over the desk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What had come through the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That was… a small but sharp arrowhead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the locked door burst open. Not because all the hinges were torn off, but through the fairly normal method of breaking the door handle to enter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why is this building so deep in the mountains? Are you crazy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A loud grumbling voice came inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Two earth-covered successors. One was Yang Pyo. And next to him, the other white successor who was quite tall but skinny…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-gyeong covered his mouth and listened to their conversation without tension.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, what do we do about this water pipe and everything? We came through digging ground because it was an emergency. Do we have to pay for this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “T-that’s why we came through the path the monster took, right? Then it’s the monster’s fault so it’ll be handled with national funds, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “As expected, we’re a crime combo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh, I don’t like it! I forgot about that incident, okay? And someone’s listening over there!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know too, man.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if the joking was just over, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s expression became serious again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon approached him closely. Park Ho-gyeong barely faced him while supporting himself on the desk with trembling arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you injured anywhere?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “N-n-no…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then I’ll guide you to the shelter. Are you alone?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon speaking familiarly according to rescue manual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t look ridiculous like Park Ho-gyeong had always thought, nor did he look like an unqualified person wearing a position he didn’t deserve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had repelled the boss monster with an arrow and walked in unharmed to save Park Ho-gyeong.
 </span>
</p>
