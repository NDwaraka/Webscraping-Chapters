  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 35
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hiss! At that moment, a snake that wasn’t completely dead raised its head again and tried to pounce on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri screamed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get away—!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As my body followed Won Ha-ri and I turned around, something burst through the head from behind the boss monster with a thud!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Monster bodily fluids dripped from the triangular-shaped blade with a curved tip.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui, who had flown up into the air and pierced the magic stone in the forehead with her spear in one strike, fell down along with the monster’s head with a thump.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the dust settled, Myo Cho-hui had landed lightly on top with her small body. She smoothly pulled the spear out of the head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Phew…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A genuinely relieved sigh escaped me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui asked me from afar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. You’re not badly hurt, are you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Probably not.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then wait just a bit? Hyeong-woo will come running up soon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hoodie I was wearing had become a rag, but fortunately I hadn’t sustained any particular injuries. I only had a few scratches from flying stone fragments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri quickly came to her senses. As if feeling ashamed, she vigorously rubbed away her tears and turned away from me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How heartless, when I just happened to see it by chance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why go that far? What’s wrong with a fifteen-year-old kid getting scared seeing a big monster for the first time?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if she didn’t want to hear it, Won Ha-ri quickly ran off to Myo Cho-hui, who was extracting magic stones from the corpse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Myo Cho-hui has a rabbit familiar, she probably came flying on her familiar, but Ja Hyeong-woo, who doesn’t have a familiar, had no choice but to run up on his own feet. The rabbit familiar is too small to carry someone as large as Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Ja Hyeong-woo, who had just now come running up hurriedly, stopped when he saw me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My completely exposed bare back was fully visible to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come here. …No, you wouldn’t come if I told you to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What am I supposed to do about that? After talking nonsense, Ja Hyeong-woo walked over himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he had a staff, he deliberately placed his palm on my back. I could see blue light emanating from beside my ribs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s this? This is an intermediate skill that can save even people on the verge of death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why waste a skill? Did you use up all your low-grade skills? Or was it a mistake?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo silently healed my back completely with his healing skill and draped his jacket over me as I crouched there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared at Ja Hyeong-woo. Then Ja Hyeong-woo also sent me an unfriendly look.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The leader of the Twelve Zodiac, Woo Sae-geon, was already pressing his brow in anger from the moment the four people entered the meeting room doorway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In order, Ja Hyeong-woo, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Won Ha-ri, and Myo Cho-hui stood in a line of four before him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a space not exposed to the outside, Woo Sae-geon’s fury mercilessly berated them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A D-grade regular gate, and one that other students had already cleared more than half of. Even if it was newcomer training, Ja Hyeong-woo, Myo Cho-hui. You two were there.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t understand how you could mess up a conquest so badly that a boss grade elevation message appears and citizen evacuation orders are issued near the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s anger was considerable, having had to handle the aftermath after receiving contacts from three places: the Association, government committee, and broadcasting station.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he soon stopped the rebuke. He interrogated those before him to learn what happened inside the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Speak. What caused the boss’s grade elevation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s face, who had been the only one trembling nervously, turned pale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Determined not to cry, Won Ha-ri hung her head low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I wanted to do well. I only caused trouble for Cho-hui eonni, Ja Hyeong-woo-nim, and…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was exactly one cause. Herself, who had been holding the boss monster’s egg.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other three people had done nothing wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri pressed down her desire not to be scolded by the leader and steeled herself before honestly confessing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The snake egg was the boss’s reverse scale, and it got broken, you see?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A light-toned voice beat her to it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon rambled while ruffling his hair with his hand. Won Ha-ri and Ja Hyeong-woo, who were standing on either side, looked at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s cold gaze swept over Gyeon Gang-hyeon, not Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did it break?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, she was holding it fine, but I was fooling around beside her and broke it. Gyeon Gang-hyeon did what Gyeon Gang-hyeon does.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More than the mistake itself, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s irreverent attitude of speaking about it as if it were nothing further provoked Woo Sae-geon’s mood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you have any attitude of reflecting on what you’ve done?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Gyeon Gang-hyeon responded readily, there was no way it would satisfy Woo Sae-geon. Woo Sae-geon closed his eyes tightly as if suppressing his anger, then opened them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You and Won Ha-ri, get out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while receiving the order to leave, Won Ha-ri absolutely couldn’t believe what Gyeon Gang-hyeon had done for her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had come outside, didn’t particularly care about Won Ha-ri. As if it were natural for him to show loyalty before Woo Sae-geon, as if he didn’t care at all that his charges had increased by one more, he walked away without regret.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That retreating figure was especially deeply etched in Won Ha-ri’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The harsh words she had said until now came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you can’t even run two laps, just stay quiet instead of making noise.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Try having some sense of shame.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When would I train separately with you? I’m getting annoyed just listening to your panting sounds now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s expression didn’t change even when receiving such treatment from a middle schooler 7 years younger than him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather, he would properly respond and sit there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just wait and see. I’ll run three laps in a week.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know what shame is.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Once you master the curriculum and escape beginner level, you’ll say bye to me too. Do well until that day. I’m probably hopeless anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the gap in abilities was so clear, when the boss monster struck, it wasn’t Won Ha-ri who picked up the bow and shot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s stopped legs soon began moving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri hurried her feet to catch up with Gyeon Gang-hyeon. When she grabbed his sleeve, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s body stopped abruptly and he turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Look at me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She whispered quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, back in the meeting room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon focused on the two remaining founding successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, these two were the ones who should be scolded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter what, Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Won Ha-ri were just newcomers who had recently awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between those two… Woo Sae-geon didn’t even give Ja Hyeong-woo a glance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Gyeon Gang-hyeon said earlier that he had broken the egg without a word, Woo Sae-geon knew the truth. He could clearly see the hidden circumstances.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The snake egg with a hard shell that doesn’t break easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Myo Cho-hui who entrusted it to Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…You deliberately tested them. Their abilities.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui didn’t deny it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With clear, round pupils without a trace of light, she faced Woo Sae-geon with a calm and composed expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui had deliberately made the boss monster head in that direction. And in a way that made Won Ha-ri think she had made a mistake herself. She escaped the situation with clever methods that prevented her from even thinking it was a senior’s doing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, Woo Sae-geon regretted it. From the beginning, he should have entered the gate as Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s training supervisor himself, not accepting Ja Hyeong-woo’s volunteer offer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he had, he would have restrained Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “To make you come to your senses, Myo Cho-hui, you must run through 3 stages without missing any from now on. Even if external gate support requests come in, I’ll give them all to you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui responded obediently with a face showing she wasn’t particularly affected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Making up for her arbitrary actions with labor was ridiculous. She was somewhat different from others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She felt no burden about saving people in external gates, and even if someone died because she couldn’t reach everyone… she felt no particular emotion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, she also possessed the acting skills to put on a bright and gentle image inside the stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s hair swayed as she was the first to leave the meeting room. When Myo Cho-hui left, Ja Hyeong-woo followed behind her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A blood vessel bulged prominently on the left temple of Woo Sae-geon, who was left alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He and Myo Cho-hui were in a kind of truce relationship.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two, who had recognized early in the gate outbreak that they couldn’t control each other according to their will, had been drawing appropriate lines and maintaining each other’s territories since then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An implicit deal where occasionally the awl called Myo Cho-hui would pop out of Woo Sae-geon’s pocket, but in stage conquests, Myo Cho-hui would unconditionally follow Woo Sae-geon’s opinions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui roughly untied her hair tie as she walked down the corridor. Light brown hair cascaded down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She was mulling over the results she had obtained by luring the boss monster this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Won Ha-ri is ordinary. At best, a talent above average. Gyeon Gang-hyeon is unexpected.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t about Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s tendency to suddenly be filled with heroic spirit the moment he recognized a truly dangerous situation. That was content she had already confirmed at the Busan Gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, Gyeon Gang-hyeon had definitely picked up Won Ha-ri’s bow and shot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The bow itself was earth attribute made by Woo Sae-geon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the arrow was Won Ha-ri’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That is, it was metal attribute. Completely unconnected to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Gyeon Gang-hyeon had used it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Attacks of other attributes have been impossible until now. There has never been such a case.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The attack that went out from Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s hand wasn’t his earth attribute, but the original metal attribute. When the arrowhead lodged in the magic stone, it was certain because it wasn’t the bronze glow of earth but the silver glow of metal that leaked out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s how he could produce such power even with that terrible durability.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The one and only successor who exhibits affinity for other attributes too…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What a shame that only I saw this major discovery and Woo Sae-geon doesn’t know. Myo Cho-hui muttered monotonously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The more interesting fact is that Ja Hyeong-woo, who was in the gate together, also doesn’t know this fact like Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the two left the meeting room earlier, I thought Ja Hyeong-woo would talk about this when he called me to stop, but… what did he say again?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Myo Cho-hui. Overlooking you doing such things to newcomers is only this once. Don’t think you can continue receiving my healing after doing such things twice. I’m not as upright a person as people think.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Getting distracted by Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Losing the eye to see what’s actually needed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon saved one healer and ruined another.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon. For you to make a proper contribution to the Twelve Zodiac, you’ll need to produce even more outstanding results, taking into account that you’ve clouded Ja Hyeong-woo’s reason.
 </span>
