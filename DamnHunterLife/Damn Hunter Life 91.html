  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 91

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fusion? What does that mean…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo repeated my words in a daze with an even more stupid-looking expression. He seemed to have no understanding at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I guess you could say it’s fusing parts of the body. Just, well, holding hands.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I lifted both my hands and showed him the motion of clasping them together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes return to normal. He also looked somewhat deflated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Now do you understand? What were you thinking about, twisting it all around? You’re not even that smart.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could introduce the breathing method I used with Hae Mi-jun before here too, but that requires concentration and is troublesome. So I settled on the simplified ‘hand-holding’ method for now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even successors with low attribute affinity should be able to channel their own energy through their hands. When you think about it, it’s similar to the principle of weapon crafting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I can do it, why couldn’t someone else?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then, that thing we tried when we ate together last time wasn’t…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That was just skills attached to my stealth skill. This requires direct contact too, you know?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the part about ‘direct contact,’ Ja Hyeong-woo furrowed his brow even more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s looking at me like I’m completely shameless.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering how dignified the original Ja Hyeong-woo’s character was, maybe it’s natural for him to react like this? Come to think of it, if someone told me that touching people was related to skills…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was pretty puzzled when I first realized it too. It’s just holding hands, isn’t it? Yet just by receiving fire energy directly from Sa Ye-ho like that, the attack power of the fusion skill increased dramatically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Rather than mixing two skills, it’s better for the other person to just transfer their energy while I create the skill alone.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In short, the fluctuating power wasn’t related to attributes but to which successor the partner was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other person and I need to match as ‘yin and yang’ and be harmonious individuals for the skill compatibility to improve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘In that case, well, I’ll have to try fusing with everyone for the greater good.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m a bit worried that my skills might become too strong and I might become too competent… But I concluded that I need to go this far to impress Woo Sae-geon and get that hunter pension.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I haven’t told the others yet. I wanted to try it with you first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I called him aside separately to tell him first as soon as I realized it, Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t seem to be listening properly for some reason. He was spacing out as if his mind was elsewhere, then suddenly said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then, besides me, you’re going to do it with other people too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. As long as the conditions are right, I plan to do it with everyone in turn—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I flinched before I could even finish speaking. This bastard can raise his voice like that too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Absolutely… absolutely don’t tell anyone else besides me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes were filled with intensity. This guy is serious. But what the hell is the problem?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, if I don’t tell them, how am I supposed to receive their energy? Should I steal it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I couldn’t speak nicely either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know who the real troublemaker is here. Look at him setting up the situation. I don’t even need to get rough first anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Stealing is even more out of the question.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s impossible anyway, you bastard. And Sa Ye-ho already knows about this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ja Hyeong-woo made an extremely menacing face and trembled with anger. Is he finding it so filthy just because it’s a skill made through contact?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wait a minute…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think there’s a small misunderstanding. I straightened my upper body from where I was sitting to explain again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t think I’d expose this to the media, do you? I won’t talk about the method to outsiders. Also, well… I’ll avoid doing it with women if possible. It’s a bit awkward between men and women.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although my words sound a bit strange, I’m being sincere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stages are videos that all citizens can watch. No matter how much I try to deceive them, if there’s suspicious touching, I could get caught.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If a female successor did this and ended up being paired with me as a couple, it wouldn’t just end at being troublesome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But with fellow men… I’m already weak and getting hugged here and there a lot. Slipping in some energy transfer in between is nothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So, will you do it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Yeah. Do the experiment with me. So don’t ask other people to do it. The successors’ combat power isn’t lacking enough for you to have to do such things. Got it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He spoke in a suppressed voice as if making some great sacrifice, but his voice trembled at the end. I was really annoyed. I slammed my fist on the table and finally confronted him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I that hideous to you? Embarrassing enough not to be seen by others? How many times do I have to say it’s because of the skill?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If you’re going to be that uncomfortable about just holding hands, then how did you hug me before?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was strangely irritated and brushing off my shoulders when Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly stood up and left the conference room without a word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, aren’t we doing it now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My voice didn’t reach him either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sigh, fine. There’s afternoon training too, so I’ll call him again after it’s over. If I’m still alive and haven’t collapsed from exhaustion by then…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had barely managed to storm out of the conference room, looked up at the clear sky of the Hunter School gate while organizing his confused feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fusion didn’t mean something else.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The process of getting his mind straight again took a long time. It was fortunate that there was no one around to see his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon probably really didn’t have the kind of impure thoughts I was thinking about.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At most, skin contact with others, exchanging saliva… even that was terrifyingly impure to Ja Hyeong-woo. His jaw tensed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …This wasn’t the time to space out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who else among the Twelve Zodiac are yang? Since Gang-hyeon would be yin, he needed to investigate who the yang people were.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need to know who Gang-hyeon is doing what with… that’s all.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He clumsily typed ‘twelve zodiac animals’ into a portal site search bar. Due to the influence of the Twelve Zodiac successors, Korea was overflowing with zodiac information. All sorts of information poured out, but Ja Hyeong-woo only looked for encyclopedias.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He read through the yin and yang of the twelve animals from the beginning. He picked out only the animals belonging to ‘yang.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, the mouse – himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dragon Jin Seol-woon. However, since Jin Seol-woon has the same earth attribute, there’s no concern about Gyeon Gang-hyeon attempting fusion with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And then Horse Ma Cheon-ah, Monkey Won Ha-ri…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next after monkey was dog. Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze, which was about to naturally skip over Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s, froze solid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His heart sank. Dog was also ‘yang.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon wasn’t looking for yang as an experiment partner – he was looking for yin!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of his belief that Gang-hyeon would naturally be yin, he had been completely wrong from the premise. It was dizzying enough to make his head spin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t need Ja Hyeong-woo. The two didn’t match.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then why did he ask me to experiment?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a moment of silence, Ja Hyeong-woo realized. He was the control group. For comparison with all the ‘yin’ people he would experiment with from now on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…That’s ridiculous. How can someone so sickly be the same ‘yang’ as me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was burning with anger inside. Ja Hyeong-woo was so flustered that he mentally spat out words that would make the person in question jump up and down if they heard them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The same Ja Hyeong-woo who usually let things slide calmly even when things went wrong and he suffered losses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Always like that… he seemed to become anxious only when standing in front of Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was no way Gyeon Gang-hyeon would listen to Ja Hyeong-woo’s words about absolutely not telling anyone else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he ignores even reasonable words, there’s no way he’d listen to such unreasonable tantrums.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Theoretically, if you match yin and yang and channel energy, the power of fusion skills should become stronger.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He went straight to the leader and made his report.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…But I really have to save it like a final ultimate skill. My health being what it is. If I take in other attributes, my body gets strained.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon listened to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s explanation with shadows cast around his eyes. His expression suggested he was listening to something completely useless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not that fusion skills were useless, but because the person who possessed that skill was useless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Include Hae Mi-jun. I’ll permit the use of Hae Mi-jun’s skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The main healer was still Ja Hyeong-woo, and Hae Mi-jun was still a sub-healer who hadn’t been given major responsibilities yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon gave permission to receive Hae Mi-jun’s support when conducting skill experiments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All successors had their skill usage controlled by the leader. Although Ja Hyeong-woo often used heal skills at will, that was only because Ja Hyeong-woo’s skill recharge was fast and he had some surplus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I try it in a Stage? It’s too valuable to just practice with in the training ground.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon was full of ulterior motives. Since Woo Sae-geon probably wouldn’t deploy him in normal situations, he was forcing a reason to participate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need to show people on a large scale that even a glass cannon deserves a hunter pension.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon flipped through the documents he was holding and found the page labeled ‘STAGE 36 Roster.’ It seemed he had been seriously deciding on the roster while taking notes, as there were scribbles all over it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon lowered his eyes and stole a glance, but he couldn’t make it out. It was seriously bad handwriting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But somehow, he had the reasonable suspicion that this might be intentionally bad handwriting to prevent people from peeking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Woo Sae-geon’s voice was heard, Gyeon Gang-hyeon raised his head again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You said physical contact. The other party might find it unpleasant, so coordinate with your target beforehand before entering the Stage.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thanks for the unnecessary advice.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you have someone picked for the first partner?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, Sa Ye-ho.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the middle of the conversation, Woo Sae-geon turned his head away from Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tell other targets about your condition in advance and get their consent too. Even if you won’t use it right away. And one more thing. You tell them yourself. I have no intention of adding my words.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What? Ah, come on… that’s too much.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon glared at Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mouth. Gyeon Gang-hyeon chewed on the piercing stare and turned around.
 </span>
