  Damn Hunter Life 1

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I woke up in bed, everything was bewildering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was wearing what looked like a white jeogori that you’d only wear during the Joseon Dynasty and pants that seemed to be made of silk. I could see a wooden bed with antique patterns, a wooden mother-of-pearl chest that you’d find in old houses, and windows made of hanji paper.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My pale bare feet and wrists where bones were visible felt unfamiliar. I had a strong conviction that this wasn’t my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Did I possess someone?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It took a few minutes to accept the situation, but there was only one conclusion. I had possessed someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, I urgently needed to figure out what novel this was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I sat up, I felt something with a familiar shape in my thigh. There was a flat object in my pocket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This, if I’m thinking correctly, could it be…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, inside these mourning clothes pants that had modern-style pockets, a phone came out just as I expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A work featuring modern people wearing hanbok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I got it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thanks to the unique setting, I immediately caught on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then next, I needed to figure out who I was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I happened to see a small mirror on the desk. The desk wasn’t too far from the bed, so when I reached out, I could touch it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man in the mirror looked quite protagonist-like. His jet-black hair reaching his shoulders suited him quite well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he was excessively gaunt. No wonder I could see his wrist bones – he was such a frail guy that I could feel his ribs under his jeogori.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t have high expectations, but it was an unfamiliar face. I couldn’t remember seeing it on the cover, let alone recalling any character descriptions from the work. Therefore, he was neither the protagonist nor a supporting character.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who the hell is this really? Maybe if I search through the phone, I’ll find some information about this guy. Just as I was about to turn on the power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ping. A translucent window appeared before my eyes.
 </span>
</p>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A Korean hunter organization with twelve successors based on the twelve zodiac animals, and among them, the growth story of Ja Hyeong-woo, the mouse successor who becomes the second-generation leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I also knew very well that I wasn’t that protagonist.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So I’m Gyeon Gang-hyeon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m pretty good at remembering the contents of books I’ve read. But even someone like me had no idea about Gang-hyeon’s appearance or distinctive features. And for good reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That guy was an extra who died in episode 1.

  STAGE 25. The monster wave that appears in episode 1, which becomes the beginning of the work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then Ja Hyeong-woo is probably heading out to conquer that right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s exactly following the flow of episode 1. Various other minor settings that appeared in the work came flooding back to my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, all of this has nothing to do with Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though this bastard is technically a successor too.
 </span>

  /How unusual for you to mention another successor out loud?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I unconsciously responded to the words that appeared in the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, right. In this world, the status window has its own consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Aside from occasionally picking fights, it doesn’t really contribute to the story, so I can just think of it as someone who adds commentary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But the status window made a good point. I was forgetting.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The character I possessed, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, isn’t someone who would casually mention other colleagues. But it wasn’t because Gang-hyeon had a serious personality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy was jealous of the other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he was the only one among the twelve zodiac successors who couldn’t awaken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The STAGE messages that automatically went to successors were meaningless to only one person – Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon couldn’t join the party even once while the STAGE waves reached 25, and instead of self-reflection, he caused trouble, so his image was already rock bottom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Always getting drunk and picking fights with passing regular hunters. Acting like he’s someone special because he’s a successor, abusing his power over the younger ones. Even though he’d immediately get knocked flat when fighting regular hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially to the original protagonist, Ja Hyeong-woo, he poured out vicious words every time they met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why when Ja Hyeong-woo recalls ‘dead Gang-hyeon’ in the work, what he mainly remembers are just the harsh words that guy, consumed by his inferiority complex, used to spew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Dead Gang-hyeon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right. According to the original work, I’m destined to die exactly today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the time when Ja Hyeong-woo is busy conquering STAGE 25.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As for the cause of death—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —He died suddenly while drinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An extra who was a nuisance with an equally pathetic reason for death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It meant I would die sometime today, but I didn’t feel that much of a crisis. Because, well, the method to avoid death was simple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I swear to heaven. From today, I’m going alcohol-free.”

  That status window is already getting on my nerves. It wasn’t for nothing that there was an episode in the original where the kids researched ‘how to make the status window shut up.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got up from the bed. But as soon as I stood up, my body swayed dramatically and I collapsed again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This piece of trash body.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The extra from &lt;Hunters Who Achieve Harmony&gt;, Gyeon Gang-hyeon, was supposed to die of sudden death while lying at home drunk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Acute heart failure… I think it was.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It might seem somewhat absurd for a twenty-two-year-old young man to die of ‘heart failure,’ but there was actually some basis for it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this work, being a twelve zodiac successor meant you were born to be a hunter. So when such a person couldn’t awaken for some reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The body of an unawakened successor was extremely weak because their ki couldn’t circulate properly. Now I understand it firsthand. Just standing up made my legs tremble.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this really the default body condition? I can’t even walk properly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There should be a function in the status window to briefly check body condition.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah shit, so I was passed out drunk?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought I was feeling weak because the power of the twelve zodiac was tangled up in my body. But it turns out it was just a hangover.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was speechless. And when I stood up, I felt nauseous. This is really something else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I didn’t drink the alcohol myself, but I need to cure this hangover.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hangover aside, I felt like I was dying of hunger. I had to do something about my stomach making such loud noises. Let me eat something while thinking carefully about future countermeasures.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see a purple silk robe and belt hanging on the coat rack by the door. It’s strange, but that seems to be the outdoor clothing. Well, what I’m wearing now is mourning clothes too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But could my current body handle that heavy, flowing outer garment?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, even with these mourning clothes, I’m covered from top to bottom.”

  Then the status window interjected. At the firm correction I could sense from the text, I momentarily thought I was naked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Underwear refers to just boxers. If the body is fully covered, this is clothing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gave the status window a sharp rebuke to get it together.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to the status window’s standards, wearing underwear, I crossed the garden outside the hanok. While heading to the communal dining hall, I had one thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just how ridiculous Gyeon Gang-hyeon is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp, Gang-hyeon…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come this way! Stay out of sight.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt more like they were avoiding me out of disgust rather than fear. Students who appeared to be the same age as Gang-hyeon or younger fled in horror.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were all dressed in hanbok too. I thought this was Gyeongbokgung Palace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Surely they’re not cooking rice over a fire pit in the dining hall too?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the inside of the building was modern. It’s just that the tables were low and the bowls were wooden.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a breakfast schedule posted in front of the dining hall door. Fortunately, I barely made it during breakfast time. I’d already gotten used to the sight of students I encountered recoiling in disgust and scattering in all directions as if they’d seen something they shouldn’t have.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ‘Hunter School,’ a separate space for training hunters, operates all facilities through an unmanned system, or more precisely, through magic. When I sat at an empty table, a meal automatically appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was my first meal, but seeing food like clam soup and tteok-galbi made my appetite return immediately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The meal was very satisfying, except for the inconvenience of the baggy mourning clothes sleeves touching the bowls.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Except for all the staring?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The way students kept glancing over here or whispering among themselves was unusual. I guess you could call it a somewhat suspicious feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t like “that troublemaker came again,” but more like they were curious, wondering “why did that person come here?” So Gang-hyeon doesn’t even eat meals?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since most people had finished eating, it should get better once some people leave.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How unusual that he’s just quietly eating.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t let your guard down. You never know when he’ll throw a bowl. Look at his face. He’s been drinking.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s a rumor that our tableware changed to wooden because Gang-hyeon kept throwing them around.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They probably thought they were speaking quietly, but I could hear all the murmuring behind me. The food went down fine, but the back of my head felt itchy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Do I have to live like this for the rest of my life…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beep—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An ear-splitting alarm sound came from somewhere. It seemed like a text message came to my phone.

  Seeing the conquest success notification that I’d only read in text was quite different. It really hit me that I’d fallen into the world of a novel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The conquest is over!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Starting with one student shouting loudly, cheers spread throughout the dining hall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To the regular hunters here, the successors were heroes, idols, and wannabes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were responsible for conquering the large-scale waves called ‘stages’ at the Hunter School, not the small regular gates that appeared randomly. Having protected Korea, they became Korea’s heroes and stars, combining chemistry and looks of peers aged 15-24.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dining hall resonated with cheering sounds. It was natural since everyone here was either regular hunters or student hunter trainees. The surroundings were full of excitement, heat, and elated voices.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, all of this was completely removed from Gyeon Gang-hyeon.

  Soon, commotion spread from the dining hall entrance behind me. He’s here.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Following some student’s words, the surroundings suddenly became quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could tell without looking back. The student who spoke was pointing at the back of my head, telling Ja Hyeong-woo to look at that guy, that there’s a troublemaker here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just pretended to slowly continue eating. I’d already lost my appetite anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Yes. I know. It shows up in the status window. When there’s a successor nearby.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah! Ah…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d bet that among the students here, no one remembered that I was also a successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was natural. Gang-hyeon was more famous for being a troublemaker than for being a successor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was keeping my gaze fixed forward as much as possible and stabbing at my rice, Ja Hyeong-woo’s blue hwarang outfit briefly flashed in my peripheral vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why did he have to sit at the table right next to mine?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly my seat became like sitting on pins and needles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo sat at any table without even looking at Gang-hyeon and ordered a meal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The other colleagues who had conquered together scattered, saying they’d sleep first, but Ja Hyeong-woo’s stomach situation was more urgent. So as soon as the conquest ended, he headed straight to the communal dining hall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Putting up with the annoyance of it being crowded with students.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And also putting up with that black head visible in the distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  /Aren’t you going to give Gang-hyeon successor a lecture?

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window prodded him familiarly. Ja Hyeong-woo answered curtly in his mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t want to waste energy when I’m tired.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, it was noisy with people crowding around. The students who had been gathered only in the back so as not to disturb Ja Hyeong-woo’s meal gradually raised their voices.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The people who had gathered in a buzz all made a fuss about Ja Hyeong-woo’s performance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Breaking through in just 6 hours is amazing!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Damn… I mean, sorry for the slip. Anyway, isn’t this crazy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You devoured those monsters!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why does everyone think what successors naturally should do is amazing? Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t understand. So he didn’t respond to anything and just silently ate his rice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyeong-woo Hunter-nim! Can we play the conquest video here? Please?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One large male student finally activated the big screen attached to the front of the dining hall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right now, here? Ja Hyeong-woo lowered his head a bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The male student, feeling the gaze of other students gathered around him, played the video himself. Then he glanced back at Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m a bit scared Gang-hyeon might flip out, but it’d actually be good if he caused a scene. He’s been quietly eating since earlier, so I was wondering why that troublemaker was acting like that.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the students had similar thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Gang-hyeon gets jealous watching the performance video and throws a fit, Successor Ja Hyeong-woo will drive him out, right? Then we can kick him out of the dining hall with this!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage waves are automatically recorded from the individual perspectives of all successors participating in the conquest through the gate system. It was a kind of special service that only stage waves had.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And if you wanted to see the overall conquest flow from a broad perspective, you could play Ja Hyeong-woo’s cam.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was a healer, and healers don’t run off on their own but support everyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one and only guardian deity of the successors, the sacred water healer Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the screen, hideous dark monsters drooled as they charged forward. Against them, the earth shook. It was the earth attribute successor’s performance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The students watched the battle as if enchanted. Several kept glancing at the silent figure’s back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon will definitely have an outburst. Three, two, one…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there was no particular reaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was watching the screen, but from behind, it looked like he was just calmly continuing to put spoonfuls of rice in his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang—! At that moment, the dragon successor’s summon heavily rammed into a large monster. The horse successor broke through that gap, swinging a greatsword. The monster’s black body was sliced away with a scraping sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It seems like the successors have become complete veterans now! Your teamwork is so good.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah… really fucking cool.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It was wise to compose the team with one each of fire, water, earth, and wood attributes. Cap× Plan×t meta—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Several students praised the successors, even using profanity. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, praising Ja Hyeong-woo to the skies. It was a festival among festivals.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then, a voice with completely different emotions suddenly popped out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No way, they did that with that combination?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that one remark, the dining hall became impossibly quiet. Everyone’s attention focused on that back of the head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why it took 6 hours. There’s a long way to go, but if you spend several hours on just stage 25…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The troublemaker Gang-hyeon, who had been muttering while looking at the screen as if he were alone, deliberately trailed off and naturally turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh, did I say that out loud?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, that boldness didn’t last long either. Cold sweat trickled down Gang-hyeon’s back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of the momentum of the original protagonist glaring at him with piercing eyes.
 </span>
