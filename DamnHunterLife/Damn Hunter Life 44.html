  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 44
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This damn Hunter School store. If it’s not daily necessities, it’s ridiculously expensive.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at my point balance that had become empty, I hugged the items I’d purchased and called someone on the phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes, hyung! What did you call me for?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still taking less than 5 seconds to answer my calls…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, Hae Mi-jun had become genuinely fascinating to me, and I’d reached the point where I wanted to experiment by calling him randomly several times to see if he really answered that fast every time. Does he answer other people’s numbers this quickly too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My curiosity was piqued, but I didn’t actually plan to put it into practice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But why haven’t you been calling me first lately?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was just asking out of curiosity, definitely not interrogating him. Even if he said he was busy, I would have accepted it. Though Hae Mi-jun isn’t the type to say something like that outright.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Did I… upset you…?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m not telling you to deliberately call me. I might be being overly self-conscious, but every time I call, your voice brightens and you seem happy, so I was wondering why you don’t call first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was a sound of him choking on his breath from the other end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I li-like, no! I, well.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you stuttering? I don’t think I said anything weird.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Of course not! I, I like phone calls! Phone calls! But I was worried I might disturb you while you’re working…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Hae Mi-jun was always the one chattering while I was the one listening, honestly I had the mindset that I wouldn’t be the one feeling disappointed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That thought wasn’t wrong – Hae Mi-jun spoke as if there were times he wanted to call me but held back out of consideration for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I have nothing to do, man. Just call if you want to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Really?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was overjoyed as if he’d received some great gift. You shouldn’t be happy yet though?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, right now, if you have something you want to talk about, let’s meet in person and discuss it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Huh, what?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I come give you something? It’s something you really need.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What?! What kind of thing? Is it something that helps with training? Thank you!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll know when you see it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s he thanking me for when I haven’t even given it yet? As if he knows what this is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’ll come pick it up!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No need. Where are you now? Can I teleport to your coordinates?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes, that’s fine!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he said it was fine, I waited about a minute first. I remembered the mishap that happened when I teleported to Jin Seol-woon carelessly last time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The place where Hae Mi-jun was turned out to be his house’s yard. There shouldn’t be any civilian surveillance cameras here. I felt relieved and handed him the large paper box I’d been holding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s eyes became completely round. I secretly massaged my hand that had gone numb from carrying the box behind my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What did I do well to deserve this…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re always doing well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Hae Mi-jun’s cheeks turned red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I knew Hae Mi-jun was shy and weak to compliments, but at that level, shouldn’t I suspect some kind of blushing syndrome?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I open it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, I wasn’t confident this item would really hit Hae Mi-jun’s heart, so I had to rely on the significance of the gift. Therefore, I quickly spoke before Hae Mi-jun opened the box.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tomorrow is your birthday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When have I ever given anyone a birthday present? Having no choice, I searched on the crappy internet, but even that process wasn’t smooth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How am I supposed to get name brands at Hunter School! Even if I could get them, where would I use them!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I had been completely unaware and passed by, that would be one thing, but the original work gave me the exact date. It bothered me to just pass by when I knew exactly when it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s just a kid. Isn’t he at an age where he’d want to be looked after? His skills have been steadily improving lately too, which is admirable.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s the only one who’s completely opened his heart to me, so I want to do something for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun opened his mouth. Since he’d never told anyone about his birthday, it was natural.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His face full of anticipation made the giver feel rewarded. Hae Mi-jun was about to open the box, then suddenly closed it again and sent me an earnest look.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t I open it somewhere else?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s your birthday present, so it’s up to you where you open it… Where?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking puzzled, Hae Mi-jun dragged me outside the house. We didn’t go far. Just to the street right in front.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can see right through you, I can see it all.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s scheme – hoping that the scene of me giving him a birthday present would be caught on CCTV, and through this, the citizens would think a little better of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll let it slide since it’s his birthday. Hae Mi-jun carefully examined the diffuser, hat, mood lamp, and other items that filled the box without context, like he was encountering objects he’d never seen in his life. I didn’t really know what would be most useful, so I just randomly swept everything in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I can’t do this kind of thing twice. It’s burdensome when the other person’s face shows excessive joy. What if from now on, every time Hae Mi-jun calls or I see his face, he constantly says thank you?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Hae Mi-jun suddenly made an unexpected request.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I hug you just once, just once?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hmm, that’s better than hearing thanks a hundred times. I roughly nodded and spread my arms. Hae Mi-jun set the box down on a bench.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite me being much taller, Hae Mi-jun hugged me with his arms up high, as if trapping me. The subtly annoying point was that this was possible because Hae Mi-jun had a bigger chest than me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Is this okay to broadcast live to Korea?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you sniffing? Do I smell like something?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No! No!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had been chattering excitedly about when he’d wear these shoes and when he’d light this candle, suddenly looked up with a bright face and asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When is your birthday, hyung?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I don’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you ask why I can’t just look at my ID, when I first possessed this body, I searched the entire house but couldn’t find it. The setting must be that I left it outside when I was kicked out of Hunter School!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In front of Hae Mi-jun’s earnest eyes, I faced the biggest crisis of my life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Where in the world is there someone who doesn’t know their own birthday?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a secret, man—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “December 6th.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A quiet voice popped out from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had appeared from somewhere, walked toward me but didn’t give me a single glance. He conversed with Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t know it was your birthday. You should have told me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No! I didn’t want to burden you…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s hastily put together, but take this at least. Sell it and buy what you want.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo handed over a small magic stone the size of a finger. Hae Mi-jun strongly declined, saying he couldn’t accept it, but Ja Hyeong-woo’s stern face was stronger, so he eventually accepted it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still not making eye contact with me, Ja Hyeong-woo’s movement came to a complete stop at my voice. Only silence flowed until I continued speaking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you also know my resident registration number?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to ask him to tell me, but fortunately it only stayed in my thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who dismissed my question with silence, showed me his back and left. Why does that guy deliberately come out to ruin the mood and then leave?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I realized something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had been eavesdropping from behind for quite a while, from the part about today being Hae Mi-jun’s birthday.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day the D-rank maze gate was conquered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo went on his own to find the conference room where Woo Sae-geon was. Even though he hadn’t specifically ordered it, Yang Pyo reported in detail every move of the raid team members in the gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Yang Pyo began to relay details down to the raid members’ casual clothes, Woo Sae-geon drummed his fingers on the table to give him a hint.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you not to ramble on without focus.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gate that was settled smoothly without incident. It was different from when he’d sent in Myo Cho-hui and the two newcomers last time. Perhaps because of this, Woo Sae-geon showed interest in something other than the gate itself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The gist is that Gyeon Gang-hyeon made a bet and fooled around, caused confusion with unrelated chatter, acted pretentious toward Ma Cheon-ah and gave unwanted advice, plus contributed nothing to the raid?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But the magic stone from the boss monster has Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s energy on it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s… Cheon-ah killed it all and he just delivered the final blow…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The advice the dog successor had given outside the gate, or the fact that he’d shot his arrow faster than even Ma Cheon-ah – these facts disappeared into Yang Pyo’s mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get out.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The leader didn’t probe further. Yang Pyo inwardly sighed in relief and timidly closed the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sound of scratching paper with a pen echoed in the conference room. He was filling out paperwork to hand over the magic stones from this gate to the association and receive them back as school assets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then suddenly Woo Sae-geon’s lips moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The atmosphere is… loosening up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hands were still working and not a single facial muscle had changed, but there was one subject he’d been thinking about all along.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How should I crush that bastard?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, Yang Pyo was walking down a slope, as if taking a light stroll.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hands clasped behind his back trembled lightly. Woo Sae-geon, who was imprinted on all hunters with such a fierce image, was still a source of tension for Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then his phone rang. Yang Pyo checked the text message.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Hey come right now]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Need to talk]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sender was an actual friend who had come to Hunter School with him. Among Yang Pyo’s friends, the person he’d known the longest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The trembling that had stopped started up again with a flutter. Yang Pyo bit his lip. It was a reaction far from joy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while making a face like he wanted to abandon everything and run away, his feet hurriedly went down the hill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
