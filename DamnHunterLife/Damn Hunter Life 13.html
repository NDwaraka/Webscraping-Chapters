  Jin Seol-woon lifted his shadowed eyelids from the status window. He placed his bare arm on a modern marble table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His arm, which looked mature for his age with prominent veins, was visible. Jin Seol-woon spent the 5-minute break he had before going to the training ground with his long legs propped up on a footrest, looking down at his arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He remembered how much he used to care about evening out his skin tone and the muscles visible on the surface to beautifully maintain his bare skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now his arm had ugly purple blotchy marks blooming on it. It was because he’d been bitten by a viper monster. The bite marks had been resolved with Ja Hyeong-woo’s heal, but the Twelve Zodiac’s only healer didn’t yet have a skill to cure poison.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t have scars.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While he was somewhat glad it wasn’t on his face, it still stung inside that the marks had appeared in a spot that would be revealed with just rolling up his shirt sleeves a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally, his hobby was browsing his SNS account that had millions of subscribers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon glanced once at the phone on the table, then picked it up, put it in a drawer within reach, and closed it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The successors would handle important contact through the status window anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Now, the only important contact for me should be from this side.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It still didn’t feel real.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That unused new cleansing tissues had been sitting in the same spot in the bathroom for weeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shock that he had to show his bare face on the Hunter School broadcast that the entire nation watched, with just sunscreen applied at most.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A few months ago, young people had fallen into Hunter School, the first gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They were fated to work as hunters unconditionally until they turned 24.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The resulting misfortune threw Korea into chaos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The trapped youth couldn’t meet their families during that period. When going to external gates, they could only catch glimpses of their faces when their parents came to the areas blocked off by police lines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the government created the Hunter Association. Not only did they broadcast the inside of the school, but they somehow connected communications so they could see their families’ faces through video calls at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, for the youth who couldn’t even complete Korea’s mandatory education, the government hastily created hunter selection processes and all kinds of systems. They promised to take care of their lives after retirement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Jin Seol-woon’s case was so rare and unique that no solution could be found, nor could anyone else understand it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The case of a 20-year-old idol singer who couldn’t return to his group’s comeback.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……My eyes see past, when I was your man—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The song sliding across his lips stopped in the middle. As he closed his own mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he was afraid of being caught by someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The work given to him now wasn’t singing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was to immediately put his legs down, get up, and head to the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was the only successor among them who had built his residence with modern marble and glass to not forget who he originally was, but.
 </span>
</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The duty of a hunter who protects the nation from threats weighed on him more heavily than being an idol who entertained fans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes even humming songs felt like something he shouldn’t be doing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the world tore him away from music, Jin Seol-woon received warm comfort from countless people. His members and the agency president repeated many words to reassure him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Male idols inevitably have to go through military service gaps, isn’t it good that hunters get military exemption privileges, Seol-woon, the group’s recognition went up thanks to you, fans will never forget you and we can’t do our best without you either, stay healthy and don’t get hurt, let’s definitely get back on stage together again……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Even so, 4 years is.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The agency promised that another member would also enlist in the military in about 2 years, and they would adjust the enlistment timing to match Jin Seol-woon’s return with the complete group period.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even if everyone gathered together again like that, and Jin Seol-woon got back the spotlight on stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if we get the nickname of 7-year long-running idols, that’s not now. Even when I go back then…… it won’t be able to compare to the current peak.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today, he didn’t feel like looking at his SNS account. On this good day, there would be lines of fandom comments lamenting the absence of lead vocalist ‘Esi’ from the group.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today was the comeback day of Korea’s top idol group, Innate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Esi’s parts were divided among other vocalists. His spot on today’s stage would be filled, and the new song would be released.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While his colleagues who had shared joys and sorrows would be holding microphones and smiling brightly amid fans’ bittersweet cheers—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon took out his S-rank weapon, a thin blade, inspected it once, and walked down the quiet stairs where not even a creaking sound could be heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Similarly, while passing through the empty first-floor hallway where there should be no people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Be your star! Hello, we are Innate!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He heard the members’ greeting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did I hear an auditory hallucination? Jin Seol-woon stopped in the empty hallway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the sound didn’t end there, and what seemed like the members’ conversation continued to be heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From inside the guest room prepared on the first floor of his residence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Jin Seol-woon finally turned direction and pushed open the guest room door, what first caught his eye was the screen on the wall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The title song cheer is a bit difficult! A little bit. But our Gifts! We believe you can do it!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Uh…… we’re informing our Gifts. This cheer was created by Yuhan hyung. That is all.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Wow, you’re passing this to me?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Below the members on screen who were bursting into laughter and lightly pushing each other, Jin Seol-woon discovered a figure sitting with his arm draped over the sofa backrest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you…… here?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon first recalled recent rumors. Reflexively, he first checked whether there was a liquor bottle in that guy’s hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sober Gyeon Gang-hyeon leisurely turned around without even pausing the video he had playing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I had quite a hard time sneaking in.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Innate’s new song flowed from the screen. A melody without Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The scoundrel’s eyes, pointedly gripping the remote control, flashed toward Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A quite intentionally orchestrated first meeting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Gyeon Gang-hyeon didn’t bother to hide this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I watched Jin Seol-woon’s face intently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……His heart must be shaken by the music that had taken over his hearing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘In the original work, around this time Jin Seol-woon was secretly hit by the comeback he was absent from and was taking a break from the internet.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, as expected, no emotional change was visible from the 3-year veteran idol specialized in poker faces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, there was one kind of agitation I could recognize.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sneaking, you said you came in.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. Literally without even an ant knowing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So no one would know the fact that I was alone with you, I told him again, but Jin Seol-woon glared at me with suspicious eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering that bastard Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s usual behavior, it wasn’t strange……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let me briefly touch on the outside situation here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You’ll remember that common areas are broadcast in real time. Viewers would be waiting on surveillance broadcast standby like a fandom wanting to see a celebrity’s commute, wanting to see Jin Seol-woon leave his residence and go to the training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But if Jin Seol-woon’s appearance leaving his house wasn’t shown, and instead the unprecedented trash Gyeon Gang-hyeon was caught entering Jin Seol-woon’s residence?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <b>
  —Are they close?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —Normal idol level;;; His quality dropped after becoming a hunter.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —Seol-woon, choose your friends carefully.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  —Please stay away from our Esi.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can already see the state of the comments.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And Jin Seol-woon is probably imagining the same thing as me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Original protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo and supporting character Jin Seol-woon. Both guys are blunt and indifferent, so their characters seem similar at first glance. However.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To Ja Hyeong-woo, you add ‘more naive than he looks,’ and to Jin Seol-woon, you add ‘more sensitive than he looks.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That bastard Ja Hyeong-woo might not even know internet communities exist.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ignorance is courage, so Ja Hyeong-woo lives his fucking own way. Original protagonists are sometimes scary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before too, if I hadn’t covered for him, rumors would have spread about Ja Hyeong-woo coming and going from Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s house.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, Jin Seol-woon, unlike his cold-blooded face that seems like he wouldn’t care what anyone says—like an idol-origin person, he cares about civilian communities and public opinion and is sometimes swayed by them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For instance, even at this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t worry. I can guarantee no one knows. Do you know how hard it was to come here hiding?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, if I turn on the Boundary Between Life and Death skill, I’d be fine strutting around confidently in broad daylight, but why not show off a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re seen with a bastard like me, it’ll damage your image, but I won’t do anything that would harm you.”
 </span>
