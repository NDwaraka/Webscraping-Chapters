 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I spent a busy day from the first day of possession.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, it wasn’t so much that I was busy, but rather this body was the problem – it accumulated extreme fatigue just from looking at the status window screen for a bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threw my body onto the bed and fell into a dead sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Late at night.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, I woke up in the middle of it. Even though I was covered with blankets, I could feel the cool temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I lifted my eyelids, I saw someone standing on my stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A white, hazy ghostly figure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a spirit monster from the gates that I’d seen in the original work. I don’t know how it got here, but—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A chill suddenly strangled my neck. My breath was completely cut off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk! Its claws struck right next to my head. Feathers flew from the torn pillow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cut black hair scattered along with them. Come to think of it, my hair is long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right. I’m Gyeon Gang-hyeon now. I possessed someone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s someone who wouldn’t have anything to say even if he died, but still, being alive is slightly more helpful than being dead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I absolutely won’t die.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d bragged loudly to Ja Hyeong-woo that I wouldn’t die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I were to die like this now, what could be more embarrassing than that?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When my thoughts reached that point, the paralysis in my arms and legs was released.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as my body could move, I slid down from the bed. I kicked the door with all my strength. I don’t know where such strength came from in this frail body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I ran down the corridor, a giant’s massive hand that appeared from somewhere suddenly wrapped around me from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Splash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I barely dodged it, there was a sloshing sound from the hand that touched the floor. As if it were made of liquid. Blue light rippled in my vision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Water…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is a very familiar setting. I definitely remember seeing this in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What this was—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash—! The translucent hand devastated the surrounding walls like a storm. Broken wood fragments flew to both sides.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crazy, why does a ghost monster have physical power! If it’s a ghost, it should act like a ghost and pass through walls!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was startled by the white thing with disheveled hair reflected in the wall mirror in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But looking closely, it was Gyeon Gang-hyeon – me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A thin body with a pale face, white clothes, and long black hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the ghost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there’s nothing behind me in the mirror?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I turned around with a puzzled thought, a white fluid was flickering and approaching in the wide-open corridor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s not reflected in the mirror, that thing really is a ghost!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huff, huff.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I ran, I glanced and saw it floating leisurely, slowly chasing me. It didn’t seem to be narrowing the distance, as if it thought I was a toy in its hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A spirit with water properties. I know what that is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one exception that exists in Hunter School where monsters cannot exist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I do know what that exception is—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But so what if I know! I can’t catch it!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I ran so hard, I was soon surrounded by the grasp that thing extended. I was caught between a rock and a hard place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gritted my teeth hard enough to make a grinding sound. I glared at the monster approaching with rippling movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t have awakening skills or a body good for escaping. Even facing a life-threatening situation, there was nothing I could do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All I had was information from the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s not an ordinary monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s Ja Hyeong-woo’s familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While other Twelve Zodiac familiars are animal-shaped, the mouse successor Ja Hyeong-woo’s familiar could change its appearance according to the folktale that ‘mice eat fingernails and transform into humans.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hiding its mouse form and chasing me, it’s more like an assassin than an open attack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo send it to kill me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …No. Ja Hyeong-woo also didn’t know of this spirit’s existence in the very early part of the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What is this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait! Don’t kill me!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work too, he recognized it as just a monster from the gate and immediately tried to kill it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally, this familiar should be following the original protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo around…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow the original work got twisted, and now it’s attached to an innocent guy causing havoc.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bang! The large pillar behind me snapped like a wooden doll. Goosebumps rose all over me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to call up the status window as a last resort and press ‘Hunter Emergency Call’—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ping!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A clear sound rang in my head.

  A new skill development window. This one appeared in the original work too. Seeing the exact same text that appeared in the original work made my heart pound.

  When even awakening scraps are precious, there’s no way I’d refuse this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, I thought that if I chose ‘Yes’ here, there would be no turning back, but I couldn’t delay any longer.

  Black light surrounded my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the work &lt;Hunters Who Achieve Harmony&gt;, the only guidebook leading hunters was the ‘status window.’ It was useful because it had various functions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, it quantifies awakened individuals’ physical abilities to help development so they can train lacking stats.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Second, it can express the power of the Five Elements (attributes) according to the Twelve Zodiac as skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Most importantly, it connects the awakened individuals. Especially the successors deeply intertwined by the Five Elements could not only know each other’s life status but even teleport to each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what about me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if saying ‘Someone like you doesn’t deserve to be a successor,’ there was no mention of successors anywhere in the status window no matter how hard I looked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  All that was visible was one skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, isn’t the skill name suspicious? Does using this mean I’ll be at the boundary between life and death? Won’t I die from using it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash—! The watery hand struck right in front of me, snapping me back to attention.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m already at the boundary between life and death anyway, aren’t I?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then is this a special skill that only appears during crises?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being grateful for whatever’s given, I swallowed a sigh and just activated the skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [‘Boundary Between Life and Death’ skill is being activated.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing the skill voice that I’d only seen as text in the original work was strangely unfamiliar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two hands visible in my vision became translucent like a ghost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hair fluttering in the wind and white clothing were the same. My body seemed to have melted into the background.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everything about my body that had been fluttering gradually settled down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t that the wind had stopped. The leaves of the half-broken flowerpot around me were still scattering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was ignoring all external physical laws.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s familiar that had been sliding closer stopped for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The palm that had been striking the ground wildly like catching mosquitoes came to a complete halt. It was natural since it was just hitting empty space repeatedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m saved with this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got one hit in. The exhilarating feeling was brief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s a problem. My body was already creaking from the long-distance sprint. But now it won’t move at all. It’s like gravity is acting twice as strong on me alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I use this for too long, I’ll really roll from the boundary between life and death to the death side.

  Origin: A body that became incomplete due to the condensed ki of the Twelve Zodiac came to straddle the boundary between the afterlife and this world.

  Description: Temporarily cuts off vital signs and hides.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So it’s just a half-dead state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems like an ability optimized for escape. It would have various uses, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What do I do from here now…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t move at all right now. I thought it was remarkable that I wasn’t fainting. My body naturally slumped down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I barely managed to lift my gaze and made eye contact with the familiar looking for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The grayish specter seemed to finally realize that it couldn’t inflict physical damage on me in my current state.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It became slightly more distinct in form, and finally revealed its true appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was human-sized, with a white shadow-like appearance with only two ears and a mouse tail sticking out prominently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was definitely Ja Hyeong-woo’s familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {You little rat bastard.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The eerie sound that pierced my eardrums made me instinctively shrink, but I sat facing it, trusting in my skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who’s calling whom a little rat bastard?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I succeeded in buying time for now, but there was no chance of winning like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {When that skill wears off, you’re finished too.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And it seems to have guessed its own advantage too.
 </span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I have no choice but to make a Hunter call after all? Just when I thought I’d gotten a skill, how embarrassing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But wait.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Could that familiar possibly not know that I can call other hunters? It probably wouldn’t have attacked like this without knowing that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘For instance, hiding when other hunters come and trying to kill me again later.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then even if I press the Hunter call, I can only get through the current situation, but the danger won’t disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And if it’s a successor’s familiar… wouldn’t it be stronger than regular hunters?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ultimately reached the conclusion that I had to solve this situation myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Let’s change tactics.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I lifted my head and sparkled my eyes while looking as pitiful as possible. I’m about to die, so what’s pride worth?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you doing this to me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, I need to know that thing’s purpose to make negotiation possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That ghost seemed to have a young mental age. If the prey acts scared, it would get excited and babble on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {A troublemaker bastard. Unlike your pretty exterior, you’re filled with nothing but filth inside.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What, it attacked me because I’m a troublemaker?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {A successor who’s only a successor in name and can’t even awaken is unnecessary to the master.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got it. That was the familiar’s real intention. The reason it wants to kill me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because it thinks I’m holding Ja Hyeong-woo back.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That familiar sees everything in the world as less than bugs, but it was different only toward its master. It cherished and served only its master, Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But through episodes, it comes to suppress that violent nature to follow its master, and ultimately becomes a reliable companion standing by Ja Hyeong-woo’s side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wait, then?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought of a clever move.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A way to make that familiar give up attacking me on its own.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One fact I can deduce from the situation because I know the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that mouse ghost had already come under Ja Hyeong-woo’s command, it would have been impossible for it to come kill me of its own accord like now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because the protagonist of this work is an extreme pacifist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I were a worse troublemaker or criminal, he’s not someone who would leave me to die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So if it were under Ja Hyeong-woo’s command, that monster would have followed Ja Hyeong-woo’s values too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But right now it came to kill me. That means Ja Hyeong-woo and that ghost currently have no relationship.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Really trying to kill someone at all costs.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who would have thought that Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who avoided sudden death, would be selected as a target that the mouse familiar wants to kill to prove its loyalty to Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I’m going to survive this time too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re Ja Hyeong-woo’s familiar, right? You want to kill me to get Ja Hyeong-woo’s favor?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar flinched for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t miss the chance and delivered a sharp blow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But do you know this? Your thinking is completely wrong. If you kill me, Ja Hyeong-woo won’t forgive you. That bastard Ja Hyeong-woo terribly hates people dying.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if mulling over my words, the mouse familiar didn’t say anything for a while. I guess it sounds plausible when you think about it?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re going to suck up, you should at least understand your master’s tendencies.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon a completely agitated voice came thundering to my ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Believing in Ja Hyeong-woo’s favoritism to pull such a move—!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Favoritism, what bullshit is that? He and I fucking hate each other.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It worked. This time I smiled faintly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, I couldn’t lift the corners of my mouth as much as I wanted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was really at my limit now. This damn skill was weighing heavily on my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud, my exhausted body collapsed onto the grass.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt the skill wearing off. I closed my eyes with some anxiety.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beyond my fading consciousness, another voice approached.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My mind snapped awake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The owner of the voice was Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his cotton t-shirt and pants, and his hair loose and disheveled, anyone could see he’d rushed over after waking up.
 </span>
