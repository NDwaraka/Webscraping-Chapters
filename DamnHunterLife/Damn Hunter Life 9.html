  Damn Hunter Life 9
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after meeting the troublemaker who was dragging down their successor’s status, Hae Mi-jun showed no signs of disgust or even disappointment like Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry if I disturbed you. It’s just, I wanted to tell you that you were cool in that video! Just because of that…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His clear voice trembled nervously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t even need to recall the personality of the ‘pig’ successor I knew from the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the face of the person in front of me, I could tell he was sincere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Um, and! I actually saw it. The 25 Stage feedback video from a while ago! Gang-hyeon hyung— no, G-Gang-hyeon-nim watching it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t know who had caught me doing that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was the one who got caught, but Hae Mi-jun’s face turned red as if he was the one who got caught.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or he was probably worried about whether I’d get angry, whether he had made me feel bad.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stared blankly at the little kid who was just fidgeting with his hands. Then Hae Mi-jun’s face became even redder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we go somewhere to talk?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was planning to meet you once anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We moved locations to have a proper conversation. Hae Mi-jun followed along well, seemingly without any wariness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m not in a position to go to a cafe or anything, so let’s just make do.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind the gym building. I found a blind spot where [Public] wouldn’t appear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I secretly lifted the front of my mourning clothes and whispered inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Squeaky. Keep watch to see if anyone’s eavesdropping.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky cursed something from inside my clothes, but I pretended not to hear and played dumb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, I have no strength in my body, so if I get startled by someone eavesdropping, I might die of a heart attack. Then what would I tell Ja Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {…}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned around pretending nothing happened, and Hae Mi-jun was staring at me with wide eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you staring at?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Oh, s-sorry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I look a bit rough from exercising.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, that’s not it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun turned red and waved his hands frantically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, I should have gotten angry here to maintain my image, but the kid was too pure so I held back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why were you looking for me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Another mistake. I spoke too gently. It’s too much for dealing with a seventeen-year-old guy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But looking at the face in front of me, I couldn’t help but do so…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was clearly the one who came looking for me saying he had business, but he was floundering like a little kid dragged away by a delinquent. His fingers started fidgeting with the hem of his clothes again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Whatever I say here, I’ll become the trash.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A feeling crept up that I’d become the bad guy even though I hadn’t done anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not just me, but anyone who had seen even a little of Hae Mi-jun’s story in the original work would feel the same way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s the kind of person he is. Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just imagining cursing at this bastard and that bastard like I do to Ja Hyeong-woo for motivation feels like committing a sin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was curious… I was curious. It was the first time I saw you watching feedback videos, and you came out to exercise today too. So…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wondered if you had changed your mind…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Changed my mind about quitting the human trash lifestyle?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, no—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun turned bright red and shook his head vigorously. What do you mean no?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, it seems kind of fun to tease him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a moment of silence, Hae Mi-jun cautiously opened his tightly shut eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And his mouth fell slightly open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is it because the troublemaker has a less vicious expression than expected?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I failed to act according to my existing image this time too, but I don’t particularly regret it. I had a good idea.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun at this point in time is a loner left out among the successors, just like me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It might be worth taking a risk here.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Enough about me… I’m more curious about you. Hae Mi-jun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I crossed my arms and tilted my head down to glare at Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that Hae Mi-jun would feel intimidated by my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that each of my words would work more effectively.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I know you also don’t use the successor training ground and go to the regular gym instead.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun’s situation is different from mine. The successors didn’t kick Hae Mi-jun out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun chooses not to go there himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know what the students say about you? A guy consumed by inferiority complex. A guy who makes himself an outcast out of jealousy toward his hyungs and noonas.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s eyes wavered. The gentle aura around his mouth disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pressed him further.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They say your power is even more pathetic than regular hunters’ despite being a successor. All the students in Hunter School know this. They whisper behind you every time you pass by. How useless the pig successor is. They say they’d rather be successors themselves. You’re not unaware that you’re hearing such things, right? But you persistently go to the regular gym while being ridiculed? What’s the reason for that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun bows his head. I quietly looked down at his trembling hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hm? What’s the reason?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Drop, Hae Mi-jun’s tears fell at my feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Hae Mi-jun doesn’t have the courage to open his tightly shut mouth and confront me, he has no choice but to keep listening to whatever I say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t want to say? Then should I tell you what I think?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I let out a quiet sigh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With this breath, I clear away the torrent of criticism I’d been pouring on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I reached out and placed my hand on top of Hae Mi-jun’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because you, Hae Mi-jun, are driving yourself into hell.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that, Hae Mi-jun slowly raised his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His large eyes, filled with tears, stared at me as if he’d heard something completely unexpected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The second healer of the Twelve Zodiac, overshadowed by Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was different from Ja Hyeong-woo, who was born a genius. Despite being the same successor and awakened individual as Ja Hyeong-woo, Hae Mi-jun couldn’t do everything that Ja Hyeong-woo could do naturally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sorry, but the word “loser” fits perfectly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original Gang-hyeon despaired in a similar situation and gave up, relying on alcohol.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can say with certainty that he was the most virtuous and strong character among the supporting characters in the original work.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’s only seventeen years old, and moreover, he doesn’t receive comfort or attention from other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only one who could be his mentor, Ja Hyeong-woo, is essentially neglecting Hae Mi-jun due to his busy schedule.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that the Korean people don’t openly criticize him because they can see he’s making an effort can’t package up Hae Mi-jun’s few months.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that thing even a successor?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gwon-yeong, it would be better if you were the successor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while hearing unpleasant words, Hae Mi-jun continued using the public gym, censoring and driving himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right. I don’t deserve to be a successor.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I deserve to hear such words.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need to hear harsh words. That’s how I’ll come to my senses.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he always walked with his head down, Hae Mi-jun was completely marked as a pushover even by regular hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shouldn’t he just die and have a new successor chosen?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey hey, that’s a bit too harsh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even as the level of their snickering remarks meant for him to hear escalated, Hae Mi-jun had tolerated all that criticism.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because even he thought it was all because of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because he was someone who deserved to hear such things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time, the sigh that came from my mouth was genuinely deflating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Facing Hae Mi-jun’s tears flowing down his cheeks directly, I was deeply moved as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, come out of hell. Cherish yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I poured out words from my heart, I found myself unconsciously gripping Hae Mi-jun’s shoulders tightly and looking into his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re too precious to hear such words. You’re not someone who deserves that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is the early part of the original work. If I don’t intervene, it will take until the middle part for Hae Mi-jun to overcome his self-esteem issues.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, if I leave it like this, Hae Mi-jun will gnaw at himself for another whole season.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s why there was actually a dark turn foreshadowing for Hae Mi-jun in the work. It wasn’t resolved by the mid-to-late parts I read.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then here, let’s guess the reason why Hae Mi-jun wanted to meet me, Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The surface reason would be that he was curious about me suddenly showing a different side, and came despite the risk of getting beaten up by the troublemaker Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But on the other hand, since another incompetent successor seemed to be making some effort, didn’t he feel sympathy for a fellow sufferer?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He needed someone who understood, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hueong…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tears spilled past his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun buried his face in my shoulder as if collapsing. I staggered for a moment then barely managed to stand firm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My clothes became damp with his flowing tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I didn’t intend to go this far…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An unfamiliar feeling. I was about to put my hand on Hae Mi-jun’s heaving back but stopped, waiting in an awkward position. Until Hae Mi-jun came to his senses and looked up with his tear-and-snot-covered face in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hic, s-sorry, hic! Sob.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cry it all out before you talk.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun seemed more worried about my clothes than his own face, not knowing what to do. That sight made me feel more embarrassed, and an atmosphere-breaking comment came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Didn’t I smell like sweat?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You smell good though… Hup!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was that something he said without thinking? Hae Mi-jun covered his mouth and looked at me carefully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look at you being flattering.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, now that the crying stopped, I can finally say what I really came for.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, would you believe me if I said I could help improve your abilities?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun looked even more surprised than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I have a method in mind. Even though in principle, different attributes can’t teach each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ve decided to thoroughly exploit the water attribute familiar I accidentally obtained, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There wasn’t just one dangerous gate in the original work. In this situation, it’s nerve-wracking to only focus on that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Originally, the foundation of all conquests is the healer’s healing skills.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let me try raising a relief pitcher, a relief healer with my own hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re probably wondering inside how someone who can’t even awaken could do anything. It’s hard to explain, but I’d like you to trust me for now. I won’t disappoint you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I believe you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His clearly sparkling eyes captured me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was a bit flustered by the trust toward me that quickly settled in those eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even though I’m not the same attribute?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just because.”
 </span>
