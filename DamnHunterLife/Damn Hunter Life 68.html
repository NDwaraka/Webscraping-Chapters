</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A towel?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It took some time for Yoon Cha-on to recall something from long ago that even he had forgotten.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on’s gaze became distant for a moment, then he soon nodded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Gyeon Gang-hyeon hadn’t said anything at the gym and didn’t separately look for the towel’s owner, he thought it had just been used and thrown away or forgotten.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon made a languid expression as if relieved. The mystery that had lasted for months was finally solved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Changing his attitude completely over just that one thing, he casually covered Yoon Cha-on’s shoulder with his hand as if they were close friends.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good thing we met. Take that towel with you. It was really annoying being a different color by itself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on let out a small laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Strange. What’s so special about him remembering just one towel that makes it feel meaningful? Really, what is this… why does the Dog Successor seem like an even more peculiar person?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yoon Cha-on slightly twisted his body, smoothly slipping his shoulder from his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just keep being annoyed by it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why are you talking so cheekily?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, thank you, Gyeon Gang-hyeon Successor-nim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Kids these days are really bold, just like they say.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without giving Gyeon Gang-hyeon a chance to grab him, Yoon Cha-on ran straight outside. Even forgetting to greet Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

  &lt;Investigation of school violence ringleaders… one of them was friends with the Sheep Successor&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the article first went up, Yang Pyo couldn’t bring himself to click or read it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Gyeon Gang-hyeon read through all the uploaded articles and summarized the public opinion for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Earth attribute hunter Kim XX admitted to his crimes, but simultaneously caused a big stir by pointing to the Sheep Successor as an accomplice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, this was revealed to be false. The Sheep Successor had never agreed with Kim XX’s actions, and it was discovered that he had actually been continuously warning his friend Kim XX to stop the violent behavior.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Additionally, the Sheep Successor revealed in his video call statement with police that Kim XX had been threatening him for a long time. When asked if his recent sluggish stage performance was related to discord with Kim XX, he also answered positively to that question.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ====
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The article came out well. There are no articles suspecting you as a perpetrator. I can’t stop the comments from being crazy, but… just ignore those bastards. They’ll die down after you fight magnificently a few times.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yes, I know. That’s what Gyeon Gang-hyeon hyung kept saying. Don’t get too distracted by comments and public opinion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo recalled the words he had said while lost in thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, the leader of the Twelve Zodiac, collected points from the successors and built a separate small dormitory behind his quarters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was essentially an isolation facility.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A space created to confine and monitor the perpetrators of this incident. Kim Sang-ju also packed his belongings from the regular dormitory he’d been staying in and moved there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, he was said to be stripped of his hunter position for a certain period.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo watched his friend, whom he would never see again, from a distance. It felt like something he had to do one last time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To wrap up his long suffering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kim Sang-ju spotted Yang Pyo and approached. Thanks to Woo Sae-geon personally escorting him, Kim Sang-ju was grumbling but didn’t throw punches.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fuck, only I’m screwed like this…? How much did you pay the reporters? Did Ja Hyeong-woo exclude just you when filing the complaint? Fucking powerful bastards…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo calmly faced his ruined friend. Now, even looking at Kim Sang-ju didn’t make his heart turbulent at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re going into isolation because you did wrong. I didn’t do it, you did it all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kim Sang-ju, who had been giggling like he’d lost his mind, soon looked up at Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stupid bastard only lived through luck… The guy who used to beg to sleep together because he couldn’t sleep at night with that big build… Should I spread all this around?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo didn’t bat an eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kim Sang-ju’s words couldn’t affect the current Yang Pyo at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It already came out in some articles. That I developed monster phobia. I said it myself, with my own mouth.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo was okay. He could confidently tell himself. I’ve gotten better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m actually improving. But do you think it’s thanks to you? No. It’s not you—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo was about to carelessly say it was thanks to Gyeon Gang-hyeon hyung but stopped with an internal gasp. Because Woo Sae-geon behind him was scary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I did well on my own!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was something he blurted out in confusion trying to cover up, but looking at it, it seemed like something he could say to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right. I worked hard too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sky he looked up at after sending Kim Sang-ju away was refreshing. Yang Pyo unconsciously thought to himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That he felt like he could live now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;All successors have been directly resolving misconduct and mediating conflicts within Hunter School, but this time they decided to publicize the problematic hunters after much deliberation&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, since Hunter School was a special space, police couldn’t directly search it. Because of this, the question arose: ‘Are the materials provided by successors sufficient as legal evidence?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Can evidence transmitted through the Gate System be trusted? Can it be proven that the data wasn’t altered or manipulated? If this can’t be proven, wouldn’t only student testimonies be effective in the end?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, since dispatching investigative personnel to the gate where Hunter School is located was impossible, these were natural questions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, there were initial difficulties in the investigation. This was a topic that would have had to be addressed someday once Hunter School entered our society.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the National Assembly passed the relevant bill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Around that time, Woo Sae-geon, the president of Hunter School and leader of the successors, announced Hunter School’s official position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;While we have been resolving issues internally within the Hunter Association until now, we will now leave judgment and sanctions to the law. Additionally, Hunter School has decided to form a separate team among regular hunters who will not enter gates but solely maintain security and order within the school.&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Hunter School security guards introduced this way would later have their name changed to ‘Student Council.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But as if this was the right time, netizen interference poured down. ‘Increase surveillance cameras,’ ‘Investigate all hunters’ past records and expose those unqualified to the media,’ etc…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hostile opinions gained strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Therefore, we believe it’s inevitable to increase the number and range of surveillance cameras following public opinion. However, additionally installed cameras will not be disclosed to citizens, and only our Association will monitor them.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Association President Kim Jae-moon conveyed his opinion to Woo Sae-geon through video call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Veins bulged at the twenty-four-year-old’s temples. Nevertheless, his expression remained surprisingly calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you know what privacy protection laws are? Are you thinking before you speak?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard and Gyeon Gang-hyeon both. Kim Jae-moon hid curses behind his eye smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Even knowing how much the Association has been stirred up by a successor’s internal expose, you still say that?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So, are you going to make me take responsibility for this too? Is there anything to catch students while only taking responsibility? I didn’t hear the surveillance camera talk.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…Understood. If you insist, we’ll go with Woo Sae-geon Successor’s opinion.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But suddenly Kim Jae-moon’s eye whites flashed. His mouth whispered poison-like words to Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Words he wouldn’t say to other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The world is made of responsibility. I’m also taking responsibility, which is why I’m saying this to Woo Sae-geon Successor. When you come out of that school, you’ll understand then.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  BANG! As soon as the call ended, Woo Sae-geon kicked over the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting that table back up became the job of Sa Ye-ho, who came to sneak a peek at him shortly after.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The chaotic school atmosphere was gradually being restored.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, your insomnia got much better, right? The professor looking after you said so.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was a bit late in submitting a request to the system to change my sobok to summer fabric. While doing so, I had my phone by my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person on the call was Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“What? Confidentiality of counseling content is prohibited! Why did the professor…!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t I even hear whether it got better or not? I’m your guardian.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Guardian…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seems to be clearly showing that he doesn’t want someone like me as a guardian, but I ignored it. I had something else to say.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then now you can sleep well without me, right? Even after going to gates. Is that right or not?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It is, but… uh, yes.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice doesn’t sound refreshed. He seems regretful too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He doesn’t have to stick next to an annoying hyung to sleep anymore. He should be dancing with joy, so why?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, is he still anxious?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I’ll provide one last service.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, just come visit my house sometimes even if nothing’s wrong. If you want to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who hadn’t answered for a while, said after a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Are you saying this because hyung misses me?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you talking about? I’m doing this for whose sake. This bastard doesn’t even know gratitude.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was kind of warm when sleeping though.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, this concludes the publicity incident. However, one question remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How did Ja Hyeong-woo continue to not know about such things in the original work? Even until the middle part I read.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I guess.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Woo Sae-geon handled everything alone from start to finish.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I had just left it alone, it would have been a bit later, but Woo Sae-geon might have eventually caught both Ha Gwon-yeong and Kim Sang-ju.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, if that had happened, there would have been more victim students in the meantime. I can’t estimate how much more suffering those students would have endured.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I wasn’t wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Come to think of it, I increased Ja Hyeong-woo’s workload and reduced Woo Sae-geon’s work.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, since it’s a beneficial result for Woo Sae-geon, maybe Woo Sae-geon won’t torment me for disobeying his words…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hope I had just in case completely disappeared due to a communication from Woo Sae-geon that evening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You made the report, but Ja Hyeong-woo held the press conference… I see.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I made him do it because it was bothersome. Why?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His sudden mention of Ja Hyeong-woo was ominous, but I responded as lightly as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, there was no escape route.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I noticed Ja Hyeong-woo looks after you quite a bit.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wonder? I don’t really know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“If rumors spread that the Mouse Successor would prioritize Gyeon Gang-hyeon over citizens, that guy’s image would be concerning too. Moreover, since you’re weak, such a moment might actually occur.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouldn’t show silence here. I hid my emotions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ve got the wrong person. Ja Hyeong-woo would naturally save citizens.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though I argued against it, Woo Sae-geon seemed already convinced. Instead, he let out a scornful laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I was just saying. Handle it yourself.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t threaten me with some pretext either. He just reminded me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the Dog among successors is too self-assertive, he wants to put on an appropriate leash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Things were going well, then I got completely caught. My throat was parched, so I gulped down cold water.
 </span>
