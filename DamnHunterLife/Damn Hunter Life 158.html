  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 158
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d seen a similar scene before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Back then it was just a measly D-rank, an ogre monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that time, I was an incompetent who couldn’t even awaken, completely ostracized with the label of delinquent. I only watched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, it wasn’t complete watching.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Hae Mi-jun’s debut battle. Since that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo collapsed from overwork, I was the one who encouraged and sent him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I chuckled as I remembered myself confidently sending Hae Mi-jun saying he could do it, while actually biting my nails the whole time waiting for the results.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t an expression to make while looking at a hellish crimson scene, so several people glanced back at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Compared to then, many things had changed now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d thought about it hundreds of times, but I never knew that becoming leader would get me promised the second-highest retirement compensation after Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun had become a proper healer with his own techniques.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Ja Hyeong-woo… had become a crazy pervert.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I thought of him, the sentimental thoughts that had briefly taken hold of me completely cooled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then it was D-rank. Now it’s A-rank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That dream, …though the background differs from the original’s final stage, I can’t completely rule out the possibility that this is that place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Clunk*, a hard stone hit my feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just because the person who became leader kicked one stone, half the successors flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What scaredy-cats.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hot, dry air. If you breathe wrong, it feels like sparks entered your lungs, causing pain. The scene before my eyes was so red that tears would stream down if I didn’t consciously blink.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In such a place, while casually throwing out nonsense, I examined the stone closely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this place where flames lurked everywhere, a stone glowing with cool blue light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>

  “This is a soul stone.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A legendary stone from old tales that would revive the dead if kept in one’s bosom.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the A-rank monster called ‘Soul Stone’ was first mentioned in stage information several days ago, experts concluded it was essentially the same as magic stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Originally a parasitic monster that would attach to other monsters and revive them when they died.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But the monsters in this place are only ghosts.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The soul stones also had no targets to attach to, so they could only roll around everywhere like common stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The stone emitted a gentle blue light in my hand. I swallowed hard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I guess I really can’t break old habits.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly crouched down and picked up the soul stones scattered together. At least until the fire ghosts appeared in earnest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing that they went into my inventory, these soul stones were perfectly magic stones – that is, items.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How much is all this worth? If I sell them, the school’s finances…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Team members burst into light laughter one by one. Sa Ye-ho, who had been grinning beside me, also bent his waist and joined in. He reached for a blue stone that was near him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ahhh!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A scream rang out. Sa Ye-ho clutched the hand that had just touched the stone and shot up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What, is it hot? I’m fine though.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was still holding a handful of soul stones at this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But no matter how much of a fire hell this place was, would a fire attribute guy find an ordinarily heated stone hot…?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It fucking hurts? What is this? It’s like I got electrocuted.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho rotated his wrist, puzzled as his hand was still tingling. Then he stared at my hand gripping the soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An eerie silence flowed. Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been looking at me with agitation, hurriedly placed his palm over my hand. Precisely over the soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if hitting something, Ja Hyeong-woo also grimaced and pulled his hand away. Even though he was quite insensitive to pain, the shock of being repelled by the soul stones seemed unbearable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked around at the others blankly in the middle of the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No one except me could touch the soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not magic stones that had already attached to some monster and lost their power, but the original form itself that no one had touched. Soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soul stones only attach to targets they can exert their effect on – dead beings…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Don’t worry about it. There must be some secret.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ended the magic stone collection with just what I had in my hand. I struggled quite hard to finish the situation without showing my chilling feelings.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the fire ghosts hadn’t recognized the living and revealed themselves just then, that awkward state might have lasted quite long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course there were no footstep sounds. The things covered in fire slithered smoothly, bringing death. Their feet silently passed over the rolling soul stones.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ominous killing intent that couldn’t be seen in low-intelligence monsters flowed thickly from them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo. Hae Mi-jun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pushed soul stones and everything else to the back of my consciousness. Surveying the monsters’ energy, I called the two water attribute users.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What you need to do today isn’t healing your teammates.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We couldn’t get through this fire pit by caring for each person like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This stage was designed from the start to place an enormous burden on these two people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Any skill is fine. Spread water’s domain far. That way, secure the temperature.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Temperature that living people could maintain life at. So we wouldn’t all suffocate to death in agony as our lungs burned first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun answered with a stern face and immediately summoned his pig familiar. *Kuwoong*. A wild boar appeared and stood tall in the fire hell, emitting fresh water energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s mouse familiar quickly circled nearby. Though the mouse familiar was too small for Ja Hyeong-woo to even ride, its cool energy alone was overwhelmingly strong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared intently at the ghosts. I read and understood the surrounding energy and flow. And I told them everything I could see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ghosts don’t charge like monsters. They try to control the air around us. So watch the air flow.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We’d done enough group training preparing for this fight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Simply preventing the fire ghosts from infiltrating our midst wasn’t enough. The four attributes in this place needed to achieve harmony and completely block their energy itself from entering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If we couldn’t do that, our entire bodies would melt horribly from burns.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Earth attribute, keep ramming into fire ghosts with familiars and skills to break their flow. Wood attribute, continuously bloom vines to secure oxygen from plants and contribute to maintaining proper temperature.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo and Jin Seol-woon quietly nodded. Myo Cho-hui was probably listening nearby too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fire attribute needs to move more carefully. Remember the backfire principle? Burn your own fire first to control the other side’s fire from growing stronger. In that process, you can’t affect team members. Position yourself well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Okay.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know all my team members are capable of executing this order.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A mountain goat boasting huge horns scattered the fire ghosts. Yang Pyo, the successor’s outstanding main tanker, bravely charged with his whole body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Beside him, a dragon soared into the sky, spreading an intense dragon’s roar throughout the area.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon sat on the dragon’s head with his upper body lowered like a mounted rider. He mercilessly spent the stamina he usually saved to support team members on attack skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Mountains Reaching the Sky (Earth Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As rare as the skill was, its power was also strong. Mountains rose beside the dragon’s body and earth overturned. The flames were extinguished by the pouring dirt, reducing their momentum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While shooting arrows imbued with water attribute between the fire ghosts, I noticed a strange phenomenon occurring around me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Again…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ghosts are oddly avoiding only me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the water ghost looked at me, I thought it was just a happening and passed it by, but when coincidences pile up, it’s no longer ordinary.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While soot stained my teammates’ faces and collars, and their skin reddened from contact with hot fire, I maintained a clean face and white clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fire ghosts didn’t directly attack me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If the original Gang-hyeon had awakened… would that Gang-hyeon have experienced the same thing as me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without a single hair damaged, I feel like I’ve pushed only my teammates into the fire. Though that’s different from the truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But my teammates don’t seem to suspect me at all, paying no attention to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, I should say they don’t have the leisure for that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A battle against intangible disaster. The war situation kept reversing. Each time the fire ghosts’ influence grew uncontrollably, I ordered my teammates to consume intermediate skills one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That way we broke the massive fire demons that approached within arm’s reach. But each time, disastrous flames struck again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huff…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Yang Pyo let out labored breath as if the heat was becoming unbearable. The surroundings rippled wildly in the hot air. Everyone’s movement visibly slowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How do I find the boss? Since it’s a being without life or body temperature, detection skills are impossible, so I came thinking I’d have to find it vaguely…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then suddenly, as if oil had been poured, flames spread across the floor ahead. Hot energy surged right before my nose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The wind that swept over my entire body was too hot. Having kept my eyes open, the world went black as if I’d gone blind for a while. Even my eardrums were blocked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Reality returned slowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s face was the first thing I saw.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was pushing me back to safety while shouting something. Sa Ye-ho’s left shoulder and upper body were sizzling and smoking as they cooked. This meant even Sa Ye-ho, who was strong against fire, had found that moment fatal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then what about the others?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
