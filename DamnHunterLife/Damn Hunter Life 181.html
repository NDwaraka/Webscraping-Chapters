  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 181
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo endured nearly succumbing to temptation several times, wanting to climax, and stubbornly continued the act for a long time. There were too many things that excited Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Things like the face wet with saliva and tears, the high and delicate moaning sounds, the stimulating lewd smell that rose without even burying his nose, and the soft skin. The flesh with good texture brought sticky pleasure just from kneading it with his hands, like rubbing a cock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he finally couldn’t hold back anymore, Hyeong-woo couldn’t even pull out his cock and ejaculated inside. A considerable amount of semen filled the inner walls that Hyeong-woo had stirred up, enough to slosh around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the same time, Gang-hyeon also climaxed for who knows what number of times. From his reddened cock, liquid that had become diluted to the extreme spurted out in drops.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ahh… moans flowed from his mouth that couldn’t even close. His eyes wandered out of focus from the afterglow and exhaustion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t even properly caressed him, showing his amateur side by frantically thrusting his cock in the same position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, it seemed like Gang-hyeon had felt it just as much as him, so Hyeong-woo felt an elation that filled his heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hip movements that tormented him were finally over. Gang-hyeon trembled and occasionally let out thin nasal sounds. Now drowsiness took precedence and his eyes closed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the receiving person becomes a mess. Hyeong-woo looked down at Gang-hyeon’s disheveled state that he had created, somewhat flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hair was matted with sweat. Even though nothing was penetrating him anymore, his limbs hung limp without even the spirit to cover his body. Both outside and inside were soaked with Hyeong-woo’s semen. His balls that had been full were now shriveled from how much he had ejaculated, and his overworked cock was also pitifully limp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That appearance was both pitiful and exciting. He looked so pretty for having done this much for him. Hyeong-woo slowly kissed and sucked the lips that had no strength to move, savoring the afterglow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They say you shouldn’t leave semen inside.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, contrary to his thoughts, he didn’t want to leave the soft, hot interior and kept his cock inserted. Staying like that, it quickly swelled and grew in size again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s lower body flinched. Only then did his eyes regain some focus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He tried to bring together his widely spread thighs, but couldn’t because his cock was blocking them. He lifted his head and showed Hyeong-woo his half-tearful eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo’s vision spun for a moment. He fell into contemplation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I restore his stamina with a skill, couldn’t we do it again?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, looking into eyes that seemed ready to shed tears and fall asleep at any moment, he calmed his impulse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Stamina recovery skills should only be used for treatment when Gang-hyeon can’t regain his strength.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The cock wet with white fluid came out of the hole with a pop. White foam, a byproduct of rough thrusting, flowed down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Gang-hyeon was freed from the penetrating object, he tried to force himself to sit up. However, his arms couldn’t properly gain strength, and only his upper body moved pathetically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s wet…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  White semen overflowed from the hole that gaped and closed again. Gang-hyeon felt around his back hole with his hand. His face, which had become innocent again, looked tearful as if he didn’t know what this was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo’s wide-open eyes persistently watched that scene that looked like ejaculating liquid from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Noticing his gaze, Gang-hyeon swallowed empty air and covered the entrance with his hand. His lost pupils kept looking at the bathroom door over there. He struggled to raise his upper body with his elbows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo carefully laid him back down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just lie down and sleep. I’ll wash you. I can also take out what’s below.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon was in a state where all thinking had stopped and he was confused, so he couldn’t properly grasp Hyeong-woo’s intentions. He only thought his suggestion was simple consideration.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, he was so eager to wash naked Gang-hyeon and take care of the aftermath that his eyes were spinning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon fell asleep unable to shake off his fatigue. His breathing was still fast and labored until then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But on one side of his face, there was also definite satisfaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my eyes in coziness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I woke up, I encountered a muscular, dark-colored arm under my head. Both I and Hyeong-woo, who had fallen asleep holding me, were completely naked without a thread on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is really what people who are dating do.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Memories from before falling asleep immediately began to compete in coming back to me. Deep heat rose to my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I really lost my virginity to Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yesterday was just a complete mess. I showed every unsightly sight. Screaming, crying, clinging…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I really need to kill this bastard. I wanted to slap a handprint on his sleeping face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even though I thought it was terrible enough to die, the current cozy feeling didn’t disappear. I waved away the suffocating memories in my head like wielding a feather duster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than jumping up and awkwardly greeting Hyeong-woo, it would be better not to wake him. I quietly looked at his peacefully closed eyelids while being held in his arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He must be tired.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not just because Hyeong-woo had driven me to the brink of death…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had woken up several times while deeply asleep. Each time, I remember seeing Hyeong-woo who kept staying awake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first, I woke up startled by the feeling of falling into water. Hyeong-woo soothed me as I was startled, pressing his lips to my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s okay. I’m holding you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo hugged my body closer and slowly lowered me into the water. When I was submerged up to my chest in the bathtub, the tension gradually eased in the warmth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m giving you a half-body bath in case you get body aches. Sleep again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Closing my eyes in the water felt endlessly anxious, so I wriggled my body around and put my arms up around him. When I directly embraced something, a stable feeling washed over me like waves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking about it now, I seemed to have fallen back asleep with my arms around Hyeong-woo’s neck and my face buried in his collarbone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sound of Hyeong-woo suppressing a low moan resonated in the neck where my forehead was pressed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is the water temperature okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before long, Hyeong-woo asked, but I was almost asleep then so I couldn’t answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I woke up again to a whirring sound by my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I felt a large towel wrapped around my body. I was sitting on Hyeong-woo’s lap facing him. He was drying my hair with a hair dryer while resting my cheek on his bulging chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know how Hyeong-woo managed it, but my arms were still around Hyeong-woo’s neck as before. Hyeong-woo must have really not wanted to let that go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t remember the process in between in detail. I just remember there was a time when Hyeong-woo put me down and got up, probably because he got aroused by himself while washing me and stepped away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So he barely got any sleep. Did I not let him sleep? He didn’t sleep on his own. Really crazy bastard, perverted bastard, lunatic bastard…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, the corners of sleeping Hyeong-woo’s mouth slowly rose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, really. I’m still not used to him smiling like that. That’s probably why my heart is fluttering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after smiling foolishly did black irises appear beyond Hyeong-woo’s eyelids.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you sleep well?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice was sweet as if coated with honey. I scowled deeply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Now it’s certain. Gang-hyeon, you’re different when doing lewd things than usual. Both are cute.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re exactly the same. Crazy mouse bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I punched Hyeong-woo’s chest and got up. I hit him so sincerely that it made a thud sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was obvious that Hyeong-woo was waiting expectantly for my naked body to be revealed as the blanket slid down. So I stole all the blankets Hyeong-woo was covered with and quickly covered my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let him show his naked body instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The vacation was over. All the successors and students returned to school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We made final preparations until Stage 11.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I… decided to spend the night before the stage with Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t touch me. I’m not saying let’s do something. Understand?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you say that, it makes me want to do it more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quickly raised a pillow and pretended to hit Hyeong-woo with it. Hyeong-woo hurriedly raised both arms and acted dramatically as if surrendering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s for sleep quality. You’re good at playing the role of a useless heater.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was petulant until I fell asleep, and Hyeong-woo smiled and countered with even more nonsense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After a moment of quiet, Hyeong-woo suddenly said.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We were in such a cold war state until now, I don’t think we’ll fight in the future. We’ve fought all the fighting we’ll do for a lifetime.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glared for a moment at the guy who put the word “lifetime” too easily in his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if you stay for just one year, you’ll get sick of me. Don’t you know my temper?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I blabbered coldly in rebuttal, then belatedly flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo was looking at me with eyes full of laughter. Regret came belatedly that I should have kept my mouth shut there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After silence wrapped around me once, I also muttered without context.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Will there really be a Stage 0?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stage 11 that we’ll face tomorrow, and then after that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think 11 is the last one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow I had a feeling that would be the case. This was closer to some kind of conviction rather than simple speculation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If so, what I’ll face tomorrow is the final chapter of the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tomorrow will be the day when both my life and all the successors’ lives will be decided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you say so, then it will be.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyeong-woo cupped my cheek with his hand. He lightly pressed the corner of my eye to make me open my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. You are you. The fact that you’re alive can’t be a problem. Even if it were, then that world is wrong, so I think such a world deserves to perish.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Hyeong-woo spoke with emphasis, I had the illusion that the world was spinning around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in the strange dizziness, only Hyeong-woo’s face didn’t turn and remained clearly in place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you understand what I’m saying? You must survive. Don’t listen to what the monsters say, or what the status window says.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I chuckled. I felt Hyeong-woo raise his eyes slightly and examine my expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I raised my hand and grabbed a bit of Hyeong-woo’s hair. Holding it like a handle, I closed my eyes just like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while puzzled, Hyeong-woo, who had tilted his head so I could hold it, secretly followed my lead. My hair rustled softly between Hyeong-woo’s fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Gang-hyeon. You didn’t answer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I fell asleep just like that.
 </span>
</p>
