</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who had been reading community posts on her phone, suddenly looked up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Rabbit unni, won’t you be leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was lunchtime with a little time left, and the three girls—Myo Cho-hui, Won Ha-ri, and Ma Cheon-ah—had gathered for tea. The location was Ma Cheon-ah’s backyard decorated like a cafe. It was a men-forbidden zone that absolutely never allowed male entry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the time Woo Sae-geon first became leader, Myo Cho-hui had clearly stated that she had ‘no interest in leading a team.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing this, people would argue between two opinions: ‘Myo Cho-hui is too tender-hearted to do work that would corner someone’ or ‘She gave up because she was overshadowed by Woo Sae-geon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah already knew the former was definitely not true. But what about the latter? If it were the latter, wouldn’t Woo Sae-geon be stepping down soon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s eyes sparkled. But Myo Cho-hui shook her head with a leisurely attitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When I lost to General Manager Woo Sae-geon once, I decided not to do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This referred to the first vote in the early days of Hunter School that Ma Cheon-ah and Won Ha-ri hadn’t witnessed directly. At that time, Woo Sae-geon had overwhelmed the students with his charisma, making them depend on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually, I’m small and look easy-going, so if I became general manager, the Association might handle things carelessly. That’s also part of why I stepped back.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah stuffed gangjeong into her mouth and pouted. Myo Cho-hui’s reasoning made sense. It was just disappointing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then who will be the next leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Won Ha-ri, who was stirring the rice grains in her sikhye with a straw, asked the question, Ma Cheon-ah turned around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mouse oppa will probably do it. Mouse oppa gave stage orders last time too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What about Woo Sae-geon-nim taking Sa Ye-ho sunbae around? Maybe he’s training him to be leader?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Snake oppa as leader? That’s a bit…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Myo Cho-hui moved her brown rice tea cup away from her lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho can’t give orders in battle, so he won’t work.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her consistent, clear voice was persuasive. Won Ha-ri looked at Myo Cho-hui with eyes full of admiration and trust.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Who do you think it is, Cho-hui unni?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo has the flaw of Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Myo Cho-hui didn’t say this. She just pushed a plate of cookies toward her two juniors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But how did you get these snacks? They’re not from school meals. The store doesn’t sell them either…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Five-colored dasik and yakgwa among other freshly baked warm traditional sweets filled the table. They were things Myo Cho-hui had brought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah answered that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “She extorted them from the store, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that possible?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri still didn’t know much about Hunter School. Ma Cheon-ah got proud every time she explained things to the newbie and raised her shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You could say the school store is a bit lenient with the founding members. Like sometimes they’ll listen if you whine about selling items they don’t have? I know Mouse oppa was the first to do it. Anyway, the guys are veterans at extorting food from school.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Founding members?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The nine of us Successors weren’t all together from the beginning—five came first with a one-month gap, then the other four joined. The five are the founding members. Rabbit unni is also a founding member!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri counted the five oldest Successors one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon oppa must be a founding member too…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why he’s a blemish. The other four all awakened properly but he’s the only defective one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When talking about Gyeon Gang-hyeon, Ma Cheon-ah somehow always overdid it while making her voice cold. Won Ha-ri tilted her head. She felt déjà vu.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That exact behavior was the pattern she’d shown when she first met Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A state where she could only become cold by deliberately trying to hate the other person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Cho-hui unni, can I wrap some of this to take?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sure.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri packed some Korean sweets in a bag.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should take some to Gang-hyeon oppa… I have to serve it to him or he won’t eat it. He always says it’s bothersome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As always, I arrived at the earth attribute joint training ground. What else is there for a Successor to do besides this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll have fun tormenting Yang Pyo again today.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the place decorated like a martial arts master training ground from a comic, I saw familiar faces. Yang Pyo, who’d been a training ground fixture from the start, and Jin Seol-woon, who’d been sticking to the group training ground lately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But today there was one additional person I didn’t want to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit, I came to the wrong place.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as I saw the scholar in the light brown dopo, I naturally spun around. I was about to leave when Woo Sae-geon’s voice grabbed the back of my neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop, Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Come here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ugh, don’t tell me he’s going to make me do training guidance too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I don’t even report my training records to Woo Sae-geon…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he’d already caught on to a lot. My precious stealth skill had also entered that bastard’s head, so there wasn’t much left for me now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Sigh, fine. Let’s not rebel and follow the old man’s words. He doesn’t have much retirement time left anyway.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I trudged to the center of the training ground. Woo Sae-geon immediately threw me into attribute enhancement training as if he’d been waiting for this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I saw it clearly. While I stood there blankly facing hell training, Woo Sae-geon’s eyes shone with satisfaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’d bet Squeaky that Woo Sae-geon enjoys my suffering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, I had to listen to Woo Sae-geon’s shouting the entire time I was sweating and gripping my bow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo! Gather your energy more densely! How many times do I have to say it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon, you need to increase your output more. You could increase it 150% more from your current range without problems.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least I didn’t have to do skill training, so I didn’t have to listen to Woo Sae-geon’s nagging like the other guys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s not because my skills are good, it’s just that practice is impossible for me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t have any low-level skills worth using in training. I only have intermediate or higher skills with limited uses, and even those damage my body every time I use them, so they’re only practically usable in real combat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “30-minute break.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon rolled us until even the stamina king Yang Pyo was panting, then recited that so disappointingly and fluttered his dopo as he quickly left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah, ha.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I sat slumped, just gasping for breath, something cold and damp suddenly touched my cheek. I trembled in surprise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was ice water that Jin Seol-woon held out. It was the most welcome thing all day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I hesitated to immediately open my throat and chug it down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo, keep watch at the door.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? Why? In case the leader comes?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s part of it, but I wonder if Won Ha-ri’s coming. If she sees me drinking cold water, she’ll nag me all day.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo clicked his tongue and walked toward the door. Trusting Yang Pyo, I immediately put the bottle to my lips. The water mixed with ice chips went down my throat. It was so good I couldn’t help but groan.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon wiped the sweat from his forehead and sat next to me, then spread his empty palm toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give it to me when you’re done.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What, don’t you have your own water? There’s not even half left.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fine.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon tilted his head and drank the remaining water. His sweat-soaked bangs hung messily over Jin Seol-woon’s forehead, unusually disheveled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Woo Sae-geon’s lackey Yang Pyo had also left the training ground, all I had to do after catching my breath was trash-talk Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I really want to spy on Woo Sae-geon training. I want to trip that bastard when he’s running… no, I want to see if that bastard pants too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is there any point in correcting your words?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon looked at me with a small smile hanging on his lips. This guy must have a lot built up against Woo Sae-geon too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you ask why I don’t just turn on my stealth skill and spy, that’s also a waste of time. Why would I look at Woo Sae-geon? It’s disgusting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What should we do? It seems like the leader really wants to continue training Gang-hyeon-ssi directly. He seems to want to polish the earth attribute Successors as much as possible before he leaves.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right, there’s nothing I can do about it. I have to accept my share of trials.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because I looked obviously upset, Jin Seol-woon added as consolation:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “There’s really less than 50 days left now. Until the leader loses his abilities.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right. Time has already come to that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s exit is in a way both a crisis in the original work and Ja Hyeong-woo’s crisis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I erased my thoughts appropriately so I wouldn’t get too lost in contemplation. I focused on Jin Seol-woon instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The communities are all talking about the 2nd leader too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop looking at communities. You need to meet people.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m meeting Gang-hyeon-ssi.”
 </span>
