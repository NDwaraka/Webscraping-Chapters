  [“Hi hi~ Ye-ho is here.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the Snake successor, who was the fourth among successors to successfully awaken, first revealed his face, people speculated he was an idol trainee based on his appearance with red-dyed hair covering the back of his neck.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The same speculation had occurred with the previous three’s appearances, and even though they all ended with the bland conclusion that they were all ordinary people, everyone was unanimous that this time wouldn’t be wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Due to his flashy delinquent-like appearance and his glistening eyes looking straight at the camera.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  People’s guess that he wasn’t an ordinary person was both wrong and somewhat right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Information that emerged from another community sometime later helped clarify his identity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice matched that of a game streamer with 500,000 subscribers, and that first greeting was exactly the same as the greeting the streamer gave to viewers when starting broadcasts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shortly after, a brief notice was posted on the streaming account of ‘GO Ye-ho,’ who had been silent for several days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Snake successor Sa Ye-ho. This is a hunter activity name taken from the Twelve Zodiac animal surnames, so his real name is Go Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since high school, unable to control his overflowing attention-seeking nature and nonsense that burst out even during class time, he started broadcasting half as a joke, and after working as a content partner for other famous streamers he was friendly with, he also succeeded as an individual streamer. That income was enough that he didn’t need to think about college or getting a job. (But since he was also good at studying, he did go to college.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t reveal his face during broadcasts. So only when he became a successor was the face of streamer ‘GO Ye-ho’ revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Appearing with a confident attitude, he declared that if not now then when would he try it, asking if it didn’t suit him well, and that he would wear sleek modified hanbok as hunter clothes and grow out his hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It’s not cross-dressing, I’m just wearing women’s clothes. This is pretty.”]

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since he had revealed his face anyway, he could have continued his broadcasting life backed by viewers who kept growing through word of mouth. The reason he couldn’t was purely the Association’s fault. After becoming a successor, the Association put restrictions on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it was frustrating, since he wasn’t a rotten person who acted selfishly without just cause, he had been following those instructions well until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, in recent weeks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, Seol-woon. Your voice is fucking amazing. It doesn’t get rusty even after resting for months.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching Jin Seol-woon occasionally promise fans to upload song cover videos, Sa Ye-ho’s thoughts also changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On an evening when Hunter School’s sky was as black as ink, he was with Woo Sae-geon in the office. It was a workspace where the successor leader handled external affairs and had discussions with the Association.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Regarding the transfer of Gate 382-88 magic stones&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Please review the broadcast order for the 8th ‘The Hero’ show.&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon was sitting at his desk with his hair down, skimming through documents. Sa Ye-ho, who had come on his own and settled in, put his feet up on the sofa and watched Woo Sae-geon. Sa Ye-ho’s hands held neither a phone nor any other objects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, can I broadcast?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon only glanced at him briefly but didn’t give any particular answer. Originally, when Sa Ye-ho said something, he ignored over 70% of it and gave short answers of five characters or less to 20%.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If hyung says no, I won’t do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The tone that had sunk like the night sky rang out again. Sa Ye-ho saying this had an expression that wasn’t excessive and eyes that were calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon looked back at the documents and muttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll probably ask again in about 3 days if you can do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Aw.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon let Sa Ye-ho’s sudden change to acting cute go in one ear and out the other. He turned the page of the document.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  If Jin Seol-woon was able to upload song videos faster than in the original, even while being a hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Would Sa Ye-ho resuming streaming also… naturally be moved up?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s going to do that first stream while putting his arm around my shoulders at first meeting, showing both our faces together without my consent?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m being chased. Just pretend to be my companion for a moment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho spoke dramatically while pressing his body closer to me and walked in step with me like we were doing a three-legged race. My steps that were about to stop also moved along.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who’s chasing you? A successor needs to run away from someone inside Hunter School? Who would Sa Ye-ho be running from in the first place?

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Comments streamed down. Among the chats saying ‘Gyeon Gang-hyeon?’ and such, I occasionally saw the word ‘role-playing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is role-playing?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought what a boring role-play this was, but if the opponent is the crazy mouth Gyeon Gang-hyeon, maybe it’s different. I relaxed my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I help more?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I completely changed my expression and brought my nose tip closer. It was an excessively close distance even for people who were flirting, not just between guys.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But as expected, Sa Ye-ho didn’t panic but rather lit up his eyes as if it was interesting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re scared, you could kiss. Then the person chasing won’t know and will pass by.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s broadcast is a clean zone without explicit content. I threw it hard as a gamble.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I turned the attack back on him, Sa Ye-ho’s lips curved up wickedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s a total win?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Apparently, this is a game where whoever panics first and breaks the role-play loses.

  ‘Since the situation is already set, let me just go along with Sa Ye-ho’s mood.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reasons I think I should become friends with Sa Ye-ho are as follows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll have to appear in front of people in earnest soon, and probably countless malicious attacks will come flooding in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’d be fine alone, but… if Hae Mi-jun or Jin Seol-woon are next to me and see the dirty mess together?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I’m looking for elements that could neutralize my image somewhere. That’s Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Speaking of Sa Ye-ho, he’s crafty, a slacker who whines about not liking monster blood splashing, but a guy who instinctively catches the delicate boundary of not being hated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his experience from doing personal broadcasts since high school, he’s currently hard-carrying the official successor talk shows too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If Sa Ye-ho becomes my ally, the official broadcasts where many stories are created won’t be entirely disadvantageous to me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the role-playing went a bit too far. I don’t want to see the chat window filled with ‘ㅗㅜㅑ’… (though it seems like it already happened) so let me crush it with a different topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But you’re standing on your tiptoes?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pointed out Sa Ye-ho’s invisible effort and snatched away the camera stick. The screen shook once, then followed my white clothes down to my feet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Look at this. Does it show in the camera?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I showed it for a few seconds then raised the screen again.
 </span>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been persistently trying to put his arm around my shoulder by standing on his tiptoes and putting his weight on me, stopped when I stopped walking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But aside from everything else, I have something to say.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re heavy.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My legs that had been shaking continuously finally gave out completely with those words as a warning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crash, we fell and both hanbok hems fluttered before settling down. The camera also rolled on the ground. It was a perfect broadcast accident that needed a ‘camera adjustment in progress’ message.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oh my, Gang-hyeon. What if I can’t hold on either? Geez, look, you don’t have an ounce of flesh. You’re walking around on your arms. Didn’t your dad tell you not to leave food?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Where are you touching?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I said it in a way that could be misunderstood, but he was just touching my ankle. My exposed ankle fit completely in Sa Ye-ho’s grasp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before getting up from on top of me, Sa Ye-ho glanced at the camera. He definitely confirmed that the screen direction wasn’t toward our faces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then he put his hand next to my ear and lowered his face. A very small sound made of wind tickled my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small whisper that definitely couldn’t be heard by the camera.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why don’t you call me ‘bastard’?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you want to improve your image? In front of the camera?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then follow me around for today’s entire broadcast.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It sounded like a kind of trade proposal. Sa Ye-ho’s red hair that had received plenty of sunlight was particularly bright. White teeth showed between his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You do everything the streamer tells you to do. Whatever it is. Want to try?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His hand immediately found and grabbed the camera.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought he’d make me do something really weird. But the place Sa Ye-ho dragged me to was the cafeteria.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he just bought convenience store snacks. The world’s first ‘Hunter School branch.’ Convenience store snack mukbang or something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Snake successor-nim…? Next to—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hi hi—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The students in the cafeteria covered their mouths and backed away. A circular space instantly formed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Confirming Sa Ye-ho’s attention-seeking power anew, I sat next to him. The camera was across from us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is Jeonju bibim flavor. Of course there’s no brand name! Can Nong× O×gi move into gates? This is just Hunter School-made food. If the food goes bad, do you report it to the consumer protection center? What would happen. Just eat it and die. Or use it as a chemical weapon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He held up what we bought to show the camera, and spread his palm behind it to make it clearly visible. It was a practiced attitude if you could call it that, having done cam broadcasts many times. His commentary didn’t stop either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I wasn’t hungry, I naturally took on the role of a light eater next to him, and just needed to keep the audio from being empty appropriately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah shit, the bag won’t open.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Oppa will do it for you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Short oppa, open it for me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m confident that I’m a calmer person than Sa Ye-ho, but somehow we got along well as if we’d known each other.
