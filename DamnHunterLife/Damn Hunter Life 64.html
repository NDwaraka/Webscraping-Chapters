</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun and Yang Pyo. I found these two myself without having Ja Hyeong-woo do it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those two already knew about my plan for the upcoming chaos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kids who were victims just like the regular hunter victims, who had been suffering together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m worried people will talk about you a lot. Don’t look at communities and stuff for a while.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. I’m fine! I’m confident I’ll be fine in the future too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at his cheerfully laughing innocent face, Hae Mi-jun seemed different somehow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you grow taller?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, a little.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s only been one season since I first saw him, but somehow his eye level seems to have risen a bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When did this kid get so big? His height and his mentality too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Lucky you, man. You’ve got a good body and you’ll end up taller than me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh… Th-that, Gang-hyeon hyung too…! No, that…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you can’t find anything to compliment, don’t start. I’m sad.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not it, huh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if genuinely upset, Hae Mi-jun’s eyes quickly became moist and he made a tearful face. Anyway, Hae Mi-jun’s kindness is a disease, a disease.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly I became curious about what he would say about me if I pushed him further here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why, how are you going to compliment my body? Tell me what comes to mind.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What if it sounds like an evaluation and you get offended? Then I’d really be sorry…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you strategically laying groundwork? You won’t hurt my feelings with what you say, so speak up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun turned red from his cheeks to his ears, whether from embarrassment. Then he gulped and pronounced with difficulty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung is pr-pretty…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if he meant my face was pretty, that would be absurd, but surely not that my body is pretty?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is this an attack created by innocence? Or was it Hae Mi-jun’s effort to somehow be polite and say something complimentary?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t say things like that to other people. You’ll be misunderstood.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Y-yes…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I know you don’t mean it that way because it’s me, but if someone else heard that, you’d be a total pervert. Innocent guy.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, rather than worrying about himself, Hae Mi-jun was more concerned about me as I prepared for publicity and ran around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you get even slightly hurt or seem to be struggling, please stop… okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The words ‘stop what when we’ve come this far’ almost burst out, but I just raised the corners of my mouth meaninglessly. Hae Mi-jun’s eyes widened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, don’t you trust me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I want to avoid Hae Mi-jun’s bundle of worries, I just need to smile shamelessly. Then somehow it gets passed over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And Yang Pyo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ll probably have police collecting testimony from you as a victim too. The key is what that son of a bitch Kim Sang-ju will say when he’s cornered.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meaning Kim Sang-ju will struggle desperately, saying he can’t die alone and that successor Yang Pyo was an accomplice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though Yang Pyo was sitting with his butt perched on the island table, his eye level was higher than mine. Thanks to that, his completely visible face wasn’t distorted like I’d seen in the same position before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather, he looked comfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This was going to happen anyway. I actually feel relieved. …People who don’t know me well might curse at me, but if I keep showing them me fighting hard, it’ll disappear someday.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo recently succeeded in summoning his Sheep Familiar again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether the familiar noticed Yang Pyo’s unstable mentality, he’d been struggling so much that he couldn’t even participate in battles for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy just told other successors it was burnout and bore the biggest problem – his worries about Kim Sang-ju – alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s large chest caught my eye anew. His height that was obviously around 190cm, and the overall attitude of his entire body that seemed like a different species from me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Sheep Successor who would someday become the Twelve Zodiac’s top tanker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was pleased with Yang Pyo’s change but didn’t show it. I crossed my arms with a crooked smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Acting cool. Just a month ago you were crying saying you couldn’t do it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…A bit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His solemn face immediately cooled and his thick hands twitched. He probably wanted to cover my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But he didn’t touch me. Yang Pyo, to put it bluntly, treats me like he would a woman. He tries not to touch me if possible, and even when he does touch me, I can see him being careful about controlling his strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Honestly, you’re someone who would collapse if I used my strength once.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is this bastard threatening me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So apart from being annoying, I have to protect you. As a tanker.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While considering himself an important combatant, he also thinks of me as a team member in his heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo revealed such thoughts with a gentle expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo, from now on always keep the Status Window recording function on. You never know when Kim Sang-ju might come find you and cause trouble.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was planning to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, the evidence videos and recordings I collected are so clear that no matter how those guys try to make excuses, there’s nowhere for them to hide.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whose voices are in the recordings can be analyzed by police through the Hunter School system. It’s certain the perpetrators will be revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the key is ‘how to punish them.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My purpose is to throw these bastards to the public for social criticism, but real punishment will be necessary too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But there are more minors among the perpetrators. Plus there’s precedent recognizing Hunter School as an official socialization institution.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kim Sang-ju is also still nineteen, a minor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then school-like disciplinary action, forced transfer?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But who exactly can arbitrarily leave and enter Hunter School? Is this some ordinary school?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this special space called Hunter School, they could somehow create something similar to ‘suspension’. But ‘forced transfer’ doesn’t work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At worst, Yang Pyo can’t kick Kim Sang-ju out of school and will have to attend the same school for about 5 years until retirement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…It’s fucked but there’s nothing we can do.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo hung his head and became gloomy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I found it awkward to comfort him, so I tried a light joke.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I wonder if I’ll get arrested by police too for this. My drunken behavior from before. It is my fault so I can’t say anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now that I said it, it wasn’t something to laugh about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What if I really do?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Yang Pyo, with that simple head of his, pondered deeply as if he really wanted to get me out of that situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung didn’t maliciously bully anyone specific, so if we’re being strict, it would be obstruction of official duties…? Something like that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cancel the simple head comment. He’s smarter than me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo narrowed his eyes mischievously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But if any of us reported it, you might become a suspect once.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please spare me, man. I really won’t drink anymore.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I put my hands together and groveled, wanting to play along once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But hyung. Did you tell the Leader…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Yang Pyo’s eyes changed. His expression froze completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I thought of the target Yang Pyo speaks of with excessive honorifics, my stomach naturally tightened too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, I should act calm in front of the kid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m going now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With that massive build, Yang Pyo got scared like a mouse. He looked down at me pitifully.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good luck.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The option of going with me to support me probably doesn’t exist in this guy’s head. Anyway, such a devoted subordinate to Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After getting a glass of water at Yang Pyo’s house, I went to find Woo Sae-geon, the final barrier, with a refreshed head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A scholar with a flawlessly intellectual impression sits hiding his muscular frame inside an elegant dopo, staring at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon already knew my plan and was waiting for me to come.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the moment I sent Ja Hyeong-woo to Sa Ye-ho, I’d expected Sa Ye-ho would leak information to Woo Sae-geon, so it wasn’t surprising.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather, it reduced what I had to explain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I talk with Woo Sae-geon for long, I’ll get dragged in. Let’s finish this quickly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But before I could even say a word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Drop it all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I encountered eyes that looked at me like I was a clueless child.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon put the gat that was on the table onto his head with a languid motion. The jade beads on the gat strings swayed faintly. But there was no sound of jade clinking at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A human who could split rocks with a sword, yet exercises quiet control in daily life as if even constraining sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t even think about informing the media.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, he tries to exert that pressure on me too. I faced the leader’s firm opposition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha Gwon-yeong from water attribute, Kim Sang-ju from earth attribute, was it? Give me that data and go. I’ll handle it through my channels.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shadows fell on his bluish face under the gat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I found and stared at the dark pupils hiding in the shadows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We need to publicize this to make an example. That’s the only way these kinds of bastards won’t appear again. It’s not something that can be solved by just catching one or two ringleaders.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Two pairs of eyes faced off tensely. Soon his lips, untouched by shadow, moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hunters are heroes. Korea barely overcame the despair created by Gates by looking up to heroes. Young hunters not yet twenty-five… people both care and don’t care about their age.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you trying to say?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hunters shouldn’t cause anxiety for people. Even when unpleasant incidents occur, they must be handled internally.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought of Hae Mi-jun. Yang Pyo too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I also thought of the middle school water attribute students who only came to the gym when I was there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  During that time, my throat naturally made a sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s the same for the Leader too. Always treating us like children while never considering that we’re young.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to leave the conference room just like that. If only Woo Sae-geon’s voice hadn’t pierced my ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What have you contributed to this school so far? I’m the one who’s maintained this school. You can’t suddenly appear and cause trouble as you please.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since I haven’t done anything so far, I should do it now. And sorry, but I originally have no shame.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you cross that door now, I’ll take it as a complete denial of me, who laid the foundation for hunters while you were wandering around drinking.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t expect Woo Sae-geon to go this far, so I paused for a moment too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems I—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Touched the pride of someone who only believes in himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t come to ask permission. I came to give advance notice so the Leader could prepare mentally too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In some ways, why am I doing something that seems completely unrelated to my retirement compensation, something that only provokes Woo Sae-geon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even so, it’s a righteous thing, so surely you’re not going to interfere.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I guess I want Hae Mi-jun and Yang Pyo to be people rather than heroes.
 </span>
