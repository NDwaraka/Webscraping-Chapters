<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was late for the appointment. On top of that, I got even later waiting for the elevator to save energy for climbing stairs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Did this kid already bail?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, he doesn’t seem like the type who’d have the guts for that. I recalled Kwak Ji-hong’s dopey face that I’d only seen once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the kid was waiting properly inside the training room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry I’m late.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong was sitting alone in the empty room. He was already small in build, but trembling by himself made him look even more pitiful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s warm inside, so why are you shaking?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah, I’m one to talk.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My complexion reflected in the attribute training room mirror was pale as a corpse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong stood up stiffly like a robot and bowed to me. He hesitantly followed me to sit in the chair across from him. He kept avoiding eye contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong probably didn’t know. He never imagined that I, of all people, would actually come to look after a mere regular hunter like him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My hunters are mine to manage. That’s what being a successor means.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You wrote in your weekly training record that you’re having trouble with attribute operation, right? That’s why I called you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, yes…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I spoke, I raised my right hand, but my fingertips were trembling slightly. I quietly lowered my hand. I closed my eyes tightly for a moment, then opened them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If it’s okay, take off your shirt. Turn around.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong hesitantly removed his t-shirt and showed his bare back. I pulled my chair over and sat down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I placed my palm on the center of his back, Kwak Ji-hong’s body flinched and contracted. It seemed to be because my palm was cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong probably doesn’t know right now. Just by placing my hand on him, how much information I can see through.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason why someone as weak as me could rise to leader position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘His energy is all tangled up. A typical beginner with no talent. But it doesn’t look like he’s even tried to do anything himself… I don’t see any traces. Has this kid been training at all?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced at Kwak Ji-hong’s profile. He doesn’t look like someone who’d slack off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It doesn’t matter. Once he’s in my hands, he won’t fall behind in attribute affinity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After taking a deep breath, I turned Kwak Ji-hong’s insides over once, like kneading dough in my hands. Even though I was being gentle, Kwak Ji-hong convulsed weakly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s okay. Just bear with it a little.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I patted Kwak Ji-hong’s shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After exhaling deeply, I began earnestly correcting the earth energy flowing through Kwak Ji-hong, strand by strand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong trembled. No matter how clumsy he was at handling energy, since he’d become an awakened one, he should be able to feel it. The sensation of energy gradually finding its proper place, of his body seemingly growing stronger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But gradually his writhing increased and the movement shook my body along with his, until finally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t want to do this! Please don’t make me do this…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time, the timid kid raised his voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stopped the work for now. I controlled my own ragged breathing first, and composed my expression that was undoubtedly gritting teeth from exhaustion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I faced Kwak Ji-hong, whose eyes were welling up with tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we take a break?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I just, I just don’t want to do this. My parents told me not to do anything either…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My eyes must have tilted at an angle. Kwak Ji-hong flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kid is so fearful, and since he’s not even a fellow successor, it’s hard to know what to say. I tried to have a conversation slowly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that your parents’ opinion, or your opinion?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I don’t want to do it either.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I was quickly blocked. Kwak Ji-hong rapidly spat out his words and hung his head low. He seemed to not want to talk anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is this happening because I don’t have as much leadership as Woo Sae-geon?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …No, Woo Sae-geon wouldn’t have been any better. Whatever he said would have been threatening to Kwak Ji-hong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why don’t you want to do it? I’m not scolding you, so tell me. You have to tell me so I’ll know.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m scared. Pe-people have freedom, right? I just want to receive a little money for not training as much. That’s not wrong either, right? I’m scared, I don’t like it. Someone like me can’t be a hunter…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong sniffled a little while hugging his discarded clothes. That made him look even smaller and younger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though this could be considered a frustrating situation, strangely I don’t feel that way. I just have a vague and uncomfortable sense of déjà vu.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So you have been slacking off.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I’m sorry. Are you angry?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, I’m not angry. You could think that way. I understand.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can’t reach a conclusion about this problem either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Awakened Law does have content about awakened ones’ training and gate clearing obligations. However, the problem was that some hunters were too young.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, the mandatory training stipulated by law starts from high school level.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The middle school section runs like a normal middle school. Kids like Yoon Cha-on who are passionate despite their young age are unusual.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But since they have to stay here until age 24, Kwak Ji-hong will have to work as a hunter someday too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you train early, you can become stronger in the future. Like how Yoon Cha-on is called a promising prospect, despite missing the early period due to Hae Mi-jun’s sluggishness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, this wasn’t something I should force.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover… I finally realized the identity of the strange déjà vu I’d been feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s me. Me right after I possessed this body.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That guy who wanted to work just a little, receive only the minimum money and retire— and he was even a successor. Really, how complacent and grandiose his dreams were. Wasn’t he lacking?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The more I chew over the past, the more reality hits me. I should stop thinking about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to wrap up the conversation with Kwak Ji-hong in front of me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m tired, so let’s talk about this again next time. In the meantime, train however you want to.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I got up from the chair, my legs gave out completely. I staggered severely and grabbed the back of Kwak Ji-hong’s chair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah. I was trying to use strength to avoid swaying…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kwak Ji-hong’s surprised gaze followed me. I hurriedly left the training room before any more words could come out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Wait, ah.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was so dizzy I couldn’t go on. I changed direction from heading to my office and entered the nearest training room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a deserted place with no one around. I saw a long bench and resting blanket in one corner. I went there and lay down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head was spinning. My skin all over ached as if someone was stabbing me with glass shards. With my insides turned upside down, it was hard to think about anything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like my body had instantly broken down. The impact from yesterday’s stage must have been significant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The chest where the mouse familiar had left felt hollow. It felt empty as if I’d lost a rib. It was close to a psychological feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly nausea surged up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh, urk…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My vision swayed dizzily. I retched for a while looking at the floor. I didn’t have the strength to go to the bathroom. Fortunately, nothing came up so I didn’t dirty the floor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even covered with the blanket, I felt chilly. But harder to bear than that was the suffocating silence that filled the empty room. For some reason, an impulse to scream came over me. But I didn’t even have the strength for that, so I covered both ears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I have just accepted treatment when Ja Hyeong-woo clung to me yesterday…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In my hazy consciousness, uncomfortable thoughts rose like foreign objects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On my phone were texts marked from yesterday. Traces of Ja Hyeong-woo persistently messaging me multiple times even after I rejected him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [You need treatment right now.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Tell me if you feel even a little unwell.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Annoyed by the constantly buzzing phone, I had sent this reply:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [I called Hae Mi-jun]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t like Ja Hyeong-woo. I didn’t want to see Ja Hyeong-woo. I didn’t want to show Ja Hyeong-woo how I looked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whenever I saw Hae Mi-jun’s eyes welling up with worry, it made me feel bad. So seeing calm Ja Hyeong-woo should be better… but why do I hate seeing Ja Hyeong-woo more?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Last night, Hae Mi-jun devoted the healing skills he’d been faithfully accumulating to me. Both the muscle pain and mild fever went away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So when I lifted my head, I thought I’d surely see a face smiling proudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun’s expression was rigidly frozen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It feels like the fundamental problem isn’t getting better. Something’s strange. I guess it’s because I’m lacking. I was happy thinking I could finally be helpful to Gang-hyeon hyung…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should have called Ja Hyeong-woo right then, but I stupidly hesitated and let the situation worsen to this point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I was afraid Ja Hyeong-woo might say something crazy like:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Stay attached to me all the time from now on.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Let’s just live in the same house. I can’t stand being anxious.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My imagination branches out. For me to think this way about the original protagonist, to have conviction close to fear…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boundaries of thought blurred and split. Like gentle waves layering over other waves, until finally the surface became calm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My consciousness was sucked somewhere. My head was dizzy and my body had no strength, so it felt exactly like dying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought I was falling deeply into slumber like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Mm, mmph.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only strange sounds hadn’t been mumbling in my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body that hadn’t been moving now moves. I tilted my head back slightly while sinking deeper into drowsiness. But the mysterious moaning sound didn’t subside; instead it grew louder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My lips felt hot and I seemed to taste something sweet in my mouth. Without realizing it, I licked my lips. Smooch—a sound like something being sucked came from my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then my eyes snapped open. My blurry vision returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was there. Closer than I’d ever seen him. Closer than right in front of my nose.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Close enough that I could feel our nose tips crushing against each other.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…What are you doing?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I spoke, my lips brushed against his. I could clearly feel the soft textures overlapping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did I realize that strange moaning had been my own voice flowing from me.
 </span>
</p>
