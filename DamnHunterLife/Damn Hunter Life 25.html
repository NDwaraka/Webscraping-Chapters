  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 25
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment the shock penetrated his entire body, Gyeon Gang-hyeon heard rushing footsteps through the ringing tinnitus that buzzed through his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Feeling someone’s warm embrace instead of the hard ground, Gang-hyeon drowsily lifted his gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, breathe. You have to breathe.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had collapsed to his knees, pleaded with a trembling voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon hadn’t even realized he had stopped breathing. When he finally tried to draw air into his mouth, he coughed up the blood that remained in his throat with a “kheuk—” sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though his shoulder became damp from the blood that burst forth, Hae Mi-jun seemed oblivious as he cupped Gang-hyeon’s cheeks and jaw with his palms, choking back tears. Even while Hae Mi-jun kept wiping his lips, Gang-hyeon could only stare blankly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Are you okay?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That question came not from Hae Mi-jun, but from the gasping Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, what about you…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine since this is routine for me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How can that be routine!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun embraced Gang-hyeon tightly while crying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From a healer’s perspective, Gang-hyeon’s symptoms were qi backflow from sudden and excessive use of awakening abilities. The only treatments were absolute rest and a healer’s healing skills… but currently both Hae Mi-jun and Ja Hyeong-woo had exhausted all their skill uses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon was flustered by his situation of being nestled in the kid’s embrace. However, since he couldn’t move even a finger, all he could do was become conscious of Hae Mi-jun’s pounding heartbeat through their touching chests.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Gang-hyeon’s field of vision, with his chin resting on Hae Mi-jun’s shoulder, the original protagonist standing alone came into view.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was empty-handed. That was strange. Why?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, because he doesn’t have a weapon in his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s staff was lying some distance away. Where Ja Hyeong-woo had been standing just moments ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the disheveled Gang-hyeon looked at him weakly, Ja Hyeong-woo’s mind had literally gone completely blank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment he saw the blood, all thought became paralyzed. His body moved with only the thought that he had to catch Gang-hyeon. That’s when his S-grade staff fell and rolled on the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He ran fiercely like a sprinter, but since Hae Mi-jun had been closer, he stopped at the midpoint and lost his way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The staff, far from its master’s hand, glowed blue even in this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s blankly outstretched hand overlapped due to perspective, as if he were caressing the distant Gang-hyeon’s cheek.
 </span>

  Soon Ja Hyeong-woo stopped these meaningless attempts. Gang-hyeon’s weak voice could be heard as his lips moved feebly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine… this is that thing, you know. Backflow. It’s not a fatal illness… and it doesn’t hurt that much…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His small face contorted, telling such a good lie about not being in pain. To comfort Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Those weren’t words meant for Ja Hyeong-woo to hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo stared persistently at the two who somehow seemed intimate, unconsciously thinking something.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I cry too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He deliberately made heavy footsteps. Only then did Gang-hyeon’s attention become divided. His drained pupils looked at Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What a strange thing. Even in this shocked and dazed state, the very fact that Gang-hyeon was focusing on him brought an odd satisfaction.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ve changed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It became clear with that sword you’re holding that you helped Jin Seol-woon last time, but even so, that incident was honestly…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I thought it was just a whim.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why did he only realize it now? Why could he only see all of it clearly after Gang-hyeon threw his whole body into it and coughed up blood? Ja Hyeong-woo resented the time when he hadn’t noticed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The scene visible now was the same. In Ja Hyeong-woo’s mind, Gang-hyeon and Hae Mi-jun should have no connection.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Hae Mi-jun doesn’t have the unhesitating temperament to embrace a complete stranger so tightly, does he?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You were the one who encouraged Mi-jun. Mi-jun’s courage was thanks to you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s eyes narrowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wished Gang-hyeon would either admit it honestly, or at least stay silent since he was in pain, but as always, he wouldn’t give in easily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I did that to make you look ridiculous, Ja Hyeong-woo. Because it’s annoying how everyone lifts you up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun momentarily doubted his ears upon hearing Gang-hyeon’s sharp words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t shaken. He didn’t stop there and continued to provoke Gang-hyeon with words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Helping Seol-woon too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I did that to make you Twelve Zodiac look like idiots.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, Hae Mi-jun tilted his head. Almost bumping noses with Gang-hyeon’s profile, he sent a pleading look.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, and Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When these two people he admired met, he was bewildered that Gang-hyeon hyung was being so sharp and confrontational.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Gang-hyeon hyung was the one acting strange. The cutting words hyung spat out couldn’t be sincere. He had been so good to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Gang-hyeon silenced Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Be quiet. Don’t say what you’re thinking right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the two were whispering about something, Ja Hyeong-woo frowned without knowing why. He thought he didn’t want to see it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had tried to lift his body slightly, rested his chin back on Hae Mi-jun’s shoulder and just panted. Ja Hyeong-woo flinched again and stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The attack Gang-hyeon had delivered to the boss monster was absurdly powerful for someone who had just awakened. Moreover, with that kind of body, a body that seemed like it would break.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, there was an entity that shared the shock that Gang-hyeon should have absorbed alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If that water energy I felt briefly wasn’t an illusion.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s gaze settled on one place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On Gang-hyeon’s limp hand, the character ‘子 (mouse)’ glowed faintly, then quickly disappeared as if caught.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Without even being surprised anymore, Ja Hyeong-woo spoke again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The mouse familiar, you made that your ally? Why did you do such a dangerous thing? I said I would eliminate it. …Were you trying to return it to me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon silently chewed the inside of his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…This is why I shouldn’t face Ja Hyeong-woo for long. He’ll catch on quickly.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah, take it back. I fucking hate being with this thing because it makes me feel connected to you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was aware that his words were becoming increasingly lame, but there was no better way to forcibly push Ja Hyeong-woo away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because the original Gang-hyeon didn’t die and is still alive, Ja Hyeong-woo has no opportunity to grow… What if it causes harm to others later?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So even if others didn’t know, at least to Ja Hyeong-woo… he had to remain a scoundrel who provoked anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even now, wasn’t it disturbing Gang-hyeon’s vision everywhere? The bloodstains spilled by civilians.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon didn’t want to accept someone’s death that would follow if Ja Hyeong-woo’s abilities fell even slightly short, and he especially didn’t want it to be because of himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I lied to the status window.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The truth was, he wasn’t prepared to become a hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was afraid of getting close to Ja Hyeong-woo and sharing responsibility for the number of lives that depended on the original protagonist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So Gang-hyeon desperately shattered Ja Hyeong-woo’s optimism.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo slowly took a deep breath, then exhaled long through his nose like a sigh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon. You just saved me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …I really can’t understand you, Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Setting everything else aside, this is something you could just take credit for, so why are you putting up thorns?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If you just hated me, you shouldn’t have come to this dangerous place at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t you have anything to say about this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon couldn’t find an effective rebuttal here and made a hastily improvised response. There was also the limit of holding onto his fading consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So what?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who couldn’t bear to look at Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes and snapped back, soon completely lost strength in his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hyung, hyung! Hae Mi-jun called urgently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo approached with large strides without a word.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if it were naturally his role, he inserted his hands between Hae Mi-jun and Gang-hyeon. He lifted him up almost as if stealing him away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Uh… Hae Mi-jun was flustered, then belatedly picked up Gang-hyeon’s sword that had been left on the ground and followed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The figure of Ja Hyeong-woo carrying Gang-hyeon and preparing to return to school gradually became smaller and zoomed out through the filming drone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The incident that occurred at the entrance of the gate, in the sea off Busan. Since only the drone remained among the broadcasting equipment, the conversation the three shared at this moment wasn’t heard by the citizens, and only the scene viewed from above remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire nation encountered that footage through numerous media outlets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This is breaking news. As of 4:55 AM today, the Busan Gate has been successfully conquered. Currently, civilian deaths number × people, injuries ×× people, of which serious injuries…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Currently, all successors are mourning the fallen hunters and have returned to school, and the funeral ceremony for the heroes who protected Korea will be held this coming Friday…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This is an official announcement from the Hunter Association. The final eliminator of the boss monster that appeared in the Busan Gate is… Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon.”]

  [“Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon is believed to have fully awakened. According to footage provided by the police, he appears to be able to fully handle earth abilities, which are the Dog successor’s attribute…”]

</p>
<p>

  [“The prevailing view is that the attack technique in the footage had similar power to an intermediate skill of Successor Woo Sae-geon, who is at the pinnacle of the same earth attribute.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Another hot topic is the identity of the weapon that Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon used to eliminate the boss monster. Currently, netizens are fiercely debating whether the weapon confirmed in the footage is the Dragon successor’s sword or a different sword with similar appearance.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The period when the delinquent successor’s awakening heated up the entire country, both in good and bad ways.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No one knew at this time that the day would come when everyone would acknowledge the era of Gang-hyeon’s presence as the golden age of successors.
