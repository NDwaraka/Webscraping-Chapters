</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The shocking article that first appeared on internet portal sites was finally reported on cable news as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  These past few days, the atmosphere at Hunter School has been uncontrollably turbulent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having learned about another side of their stern leader, whom they had feared yet followed, in the worst possible way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kind of material that could make even a successful celebrity fall into ruin in an instant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kind of material that could completely destroy all reputation in one blow, no matter how sincere and good a person had been evaluated to be until then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Taking a half-bath, I crossed my feet the opposite way in the steaming bathtub.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I recalled the American news I had frantically searched as soon as I learned about Woo Sae-geon’s allegations.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reporting had been mixed over there too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Articles claiming Woo Sae-geon isn’t Korea’s #1 but an American hunter.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The claim that if Woo Sae-geon hadn’t happened to be visiting Korea and ended up at Korean Hunter School, he would have been an American awakener. It seemed like a scheme to steal Korea’s #1 position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And the other side—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Provocative articles claiming Woo Sae-geon is indeed a Korean hunter, but might be a criminal who previously dealt drugs. Articles that excitedly wrote gossip saying he wasn’t their country’s hunter even before investigation results came out.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it’s not true anyway, Woo Sae-geon just needs to quickly undergo police investigation and be cleared of charges…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem is that Korean hunters trapped in Hunter School can’t contact outside people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This incident turned what should have been the tragedy of Korea’s #1 disappearing in just 2 weeks into the disaster of still having to wait 2 whole weeks for Woo Sae-geon to undergo investigation and clear his name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, since it’s a case reported from a foreign country rather than mainland Korea, it’s difficult to immediately receive updates on the investigation status of the drug trafficking organization that fingered Woo Sae-geon. Therefore, results and explanations continue to be delayed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It seems the American friendship match broadcast became the root of trouble. I heard Successor Woo Sae-geon proceeded knowing there might be people who would recognize him, but to get involved in such an unsavory matter…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s what Manager Park Yoon-seok told me in a subdued voice when I called him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On one hand, I can finally understand Woo Sae-geon’s behavior now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason the former tattooist deliberately adopted a concept with the image most opposite to himself, and absolutely never showed his hair untied.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It must have been to prevent acquaintances in America from recognizing him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Honestly, the past photos in the articles were startling. I really thought he was a gang member.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like photos taken by tattooist colleagues in back alleys, where Woo Sae-geon appeared only as a distant side profile showing his back, as if he hadn’t wanted to be photographed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Long black hair loosely tied in one, with a strangely exotic feel. Muscular shoulders coolly revealed by a sleeveless shirt. Chaotic tattoos densely covering his neck and arms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s radical, really. Isn’t this the scholar’s shocking past?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, the people standing in front of him added to that shock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though their faces were covered, they all basically had menacing tattoos on their bodies, and were either more burly than Woo Sae-geon or American women dressed provocatively, so it was natural if you think about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, this is Woo Sae-geon’s first past photo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No wonder the broadcast PDs couldn’t get any. He was someone who lived in America.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But then, if he also grew up in America, why was he so hostile during the friendship match? Was it all acting? Or does he not like where he grew up…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, this is why people’s opinions were divided from the very early days of the successors’ appearance. About Woo Sae-geon and Ja Hyeong-woo’s pasts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And among them, Woo Sae-geon’s secret has been revealed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Rather than revealed… it was exposed. Against his will.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At an official press conference a few days ago, Woo Sae-geon only briefly stated, ‘Everything except the drug matter is true,’ and immediately cut off the video call screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only I was frustrated watching it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is his way of speaking like that? He should say it backwards! He should emphasize that while he is Korean-American and a tattooist, he was absolutely never involved with drugs!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s still frustrating to think about. I got angry and moved my body, causing the bathwater to splash.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually I got tired and leaned back against the bathtub again, sighing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t see this kind of thing in the original work either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I realize that as my original work information reaches its end, more and more things I don’t know will happen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There’s nothing I can do to help either…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No wait. Even if there were something I could do, why should I do anything for Woo Sae-geon? I’m a delinquent, aren’t I? And what have I ever received from that guy?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned on my phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At some point, I had everyone’s phone numbers except Myo Cho-hui and Woo Sae-geon. I entered the group message window and typed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [You know that news is bullshit I wouldn’t even bother with, right?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Bastards with grudges are excited that Woo Sae-geon is retiring and acting up]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [You absolutely cannot show it]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [If you think you can’t manage your expressions in front of Woo Sae-geon, avoid him instead]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I almost dropped my phone in the water once, then carefully set it down safely near the bathtub edge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because I was angry, even though the water had cooled, I felt too hot instead of cold. I fanned my face with my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So there are bastards who don’t care that they’ll get cursed at in reverse when he’s cleared, and just decided to drag someone down.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I’ve been cursed at for until now was just because I deserved to be cursed at…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I was about to slowly pull the bathtub drain and get out before my hands and feet got wrinkled, my phone rang.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a call from Sa Ye-ho. I was too lazy to dry my hands again so I ignored the call and asked via chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: Why?

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor&gt;Me: Can I come to your house now?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: I’m bathing

</p>
<p>

  Snake Successor&gt;Me: Fuck it I’ll just teleport

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  20 minutes later, Sa Ye-ho who came to my house was dangling a bottle of alcohol in his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t even offer me a drink, then sprawled on my sofa and blew into the wine bottle. After gulping it down for a while, Sa Ye-ho went “Pah,” pulled his lips away and grinned at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A guy who’s such a heavy drinker he doesn’t even get drunk on stuff like that, why is he acting like this? Ah, he was always like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Or is he also troubled?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I plopped down next to him and cursed while checking the alcohol content of the wine bottle Sa Ye-ho was holding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You have a stage in three days, you crazy bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Our puppy is worried about oppa~.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, only the sound of Sa Ye-ho’s throat gurgling could be heard. In the rare silence, I quietly opened my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me some Woo Sae-geon TMI today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho answered as if he’d been waiting. As expected, without any trace of laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s in a bad mood. The worst I’ve seen.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that he won’t let me into his office means it’s really serious. Sa Ye-ho muttered unconsciously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence flowed again. We both sat side by side just staring straight ahead. Neither of us suggested turning on the TV.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Want me to tell you something interesting?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t react at all but Sa Ye-ho started rambling on and on. Drinking in between, with a dazed face like he was drunk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Remember what I told you before? When Sae-geon hyung first summoned his ox familiar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That incident I call the rodeo incident.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The incident where the ox familiar didn’t obey orders and went berserk, so Woo Sae-geon got beaten to a pulp for 3 hours while subduing his familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho stopped talking, took out a new bottle from inventory, and burned off the cork with his bare hands. After cleaning up the ash completely, he took several gulps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His eyes had sunk even deeper by then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The ox familiar was following Sae-geon hyung’s orders from the beginning.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first I didn’t understand, then I realized and got goosebumps all over my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What kind of person is Sae-geon hyung that some little thing wouldn’t follow him?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The rodeo incident was actually Woo Sae-geon’s self-directed play.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon ordered the ox familiar to rampage like a demon, then ordered it to attack him and fought it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He deliberately made his body bleed. And he made the students see that entire spectacle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …That’s how he instilled fear in the students and seized power.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No wonder controlling the ox familiar was easy for me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expected it might have been something he deliberately showed to students… but this isn’t something a normal person would do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Woo Sae-geon’s such behavior didn’t stem from malice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because that was the easiest way to control students. Because he thought only by controlling everything himself could the chaotic early Hunter School and hunters become stable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The confidence of someone who was a tattooist believing he should do something he’d never tried before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, in that process, he doesn’t consider at all that he might get hurt or suffer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why he makes people fucking worry.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing Sa Ye-ho’s muttering, I canceled my previous thought that Sa Ye-ho was the type to readily reveal his inner thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that weren’t the case, there’s no way Sa Ye-ho could have perfectly hidden it when he was capable of making such eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Sa Ye-ho’s pale irises glanced back at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you. That Sae-geon hyung and you are similar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t like a joke. So this time I tried to think about it as seriously as possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Don’t tell me that time I self-harmed saying I’d develop Ja Hyeong-woo’s abilities?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, is that the same level?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The mindset is similar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What Sa Ye-ho was worried about was Woo Sae-geon’s plan that had completely collapsed when his retirement was almost here. His plan to finish activities safely and return to America to live quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current Woo Sae-geon has had everything collapse. His plan, the impression he’d built up until now. …And probably his pride too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In such a situation, the day of his final stage battle had arrived.
 </span>
