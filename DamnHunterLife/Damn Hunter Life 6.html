 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bombshell statement from the Dog successor who had never shown his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This incident, which was no different from internal whistleblowing, created a controversy of considerable scale following ‘the chaos caused by the appearance of the first gate’, ‘Hunter School Stage 1 first strategy’, and ‘the first death among young hunters’.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was certainly good that public opinion gained strength calling for banning indiscriminate content creation attempts from outsiders for students’ convenience. However, this didn’t stop there and spread into a situation where all disputes surrounding the special space called Hunter School caught fire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What calmed the chaos was a single video directly delivered to the association by the Twelve Zodiac successors that same evening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Public]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Against a plain empty wall background, a black gat placed on a table appears on screen. Soon the video’s focus fixes on the face of the person sitting across from it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The man wearing a light purple dopo with his hair in a topknot looked elegant like a Joseon Dynasty scholar at first glance. His deeply set eye sockets and protruding brow bones evoked the image of a banker working in finance. From any angle, he looked like someone who would suit calculators or keyboards rather than physical combat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His identity was Woo Sae-geon, the ‘Ox’ successor, the eldest among successors and an irreplaceable leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Ja Hyeong-woo was called the guardian deity of successors, Woo Sae-geon was called their war god.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Student Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s statement was not discussed with us successors.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throughout the short announcement, his shadowed eyes didn’t blink.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“We gratefully accept the positive interest toward Hunter School and will repay it with efforts to become even stronger.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as it seemed the video would end there, Woo Sae-geon raised his eyebrows high and took a few more seconds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gyeon Gang-hyeon.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice calling the name without warning was extremely sharp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Do you think you’re qualified to say such things?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who watched the video to the end, smiled bitterly at home.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Oh my. He’s trying to kick me out.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what to do? I have no intention of being quietly cut out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Before long, the Twelve Zodiac will need me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I reread the text that came to Ja Hyeong-woo right after the video of me cursing in front of reporters aired.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Are you crazy?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, it’s too short to read anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My reply was also left below. It was already dated two days ago, and I hadn’t received a response to it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [ㅗㅗ The crazy one is you bastard texting during training time]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I first saw Woo Sae-geon’s video provoking me, I was definitely confident.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Based on the original work information I knew, I would use the current public fear-mongering controversy as a concept to get recruited into the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But I need to awaken to fight or do anything!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I knew other things, I didn’t know how to awaken. It wasn’t in the original work either. Well, all the original characters were already awakened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it’s a world inside a novel, maybe I’ll awaken if I receive hunter education.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They say excellent students get plenty of points? The more points the better, and according to the original work, there will be times when I need to use them in large quantities later. Anyway, since I had to receive education, I took a look at the general hunter education curriculum.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Korean, English, Math academic courses. Can’t take these after age 20.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Skill operation practice. Skipped because I’m unawakened and have no skills to practice. The stealth technique that others can’t see is useless here…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Five elements attribute understanding. Shouldn’t I be going in as a teacher for this? Still, if I say I want to take it, I’m a successor so I could probably squeeze in somehow.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to take at least five subjects. I looked at the remaining subjects.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Basic physical training.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Swordsmanship/Archery/Spearmanship basics.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Group combat practice.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘More training.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Anyway training.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Anyway physical work…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The trash who just collapsed and napped for 30 minutes after walking up 3 flights of stairs earlier gloriously fell to his knees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I want to take education to awaken, but what if the education requires awakened stamina?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll awaken even if it’s just out of spite.”

  Staring intently at the only text floating there, something occurred to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Maybe I can develop this skill.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Here’s one setting from the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the awakening skills appearing in the original work, there are no skills without attributes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So my skill is a type I’m seeing for the first time too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unawakened people don’t belong to any attribute, and since I failed to awaken, it was natural if you think about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original work was even titled &lt;Hunters Who Achieve Harmony&gt;. So having no attribute seems like a flaw at first glance. The same goes for the only skill being about cutting off vital signs and becoming half-dead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But thinking about it differently, having no attribute could mean being able to contain any attribute, right? Even though it shows as no attribute, my skill is ultimately a hunter’s power… So it might not be nothing (無) but empty (空).’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, hypothesis. Can’t skills marked as ‘no attribute’ be arbitrarily filled with attributes? If this is correct, ‘no attribute’ might become an opportunity to overcome the shortcomings of other skills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Of course, it’s not something I can do alone.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shifted my gaze to the gourd I’d received from Ja Hyeong-woo and set aside, now tied to the bedroom coat hanger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I flicked away Ja Hyeong-woo’s note tied together with the gourd string. Grabbing the gourd stopper, I opened it with a click. A pitch-black opening appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, squeaky.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I expected the Mouse Familiar to immediately jump out to strangle me, but it was quiet as a dead mouse. I became someone who just called a name into thin air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m calling you. Squeaky. You gonna keep ignoring me? You know what I’ll tell Ja Hyeong-woo?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bringing up Ja Hyeong-woo worked as expected. A blue figure the size of a person smoothly appeared on the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Disgusting bastard.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is that how you talk to your benefactor?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar trembled violently. I leaned my upper body away from the backrest and rested my chin on my arm placed on the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo abandoned you. You know, right? That bastard tried to eliminate you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {……}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The familiar fell silent for a moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Drip, drip. Soon translucent blue droplets fell from what was presumably its eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I quietly watched the tears that disappeared upon touching the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I shouldn’t say that it’s because Ja Hyeong-woo thinks you’re an ordinary familiar without speech or intelligence.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ve never lied. Right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, when the time comes, I planned to send it back to Ja Hyeong-woo’s side later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though its personality was shit, how long was I going to keep the Mouse Familiar that becomes Ja Hyeong-woo’s important weapon in the original work locked in a gourd?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should send it back to its original place. Of course, after sucking out all the sweet benefits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How about this?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar looked up at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stay by my side until this summer. Protect me when I’m in danger and cooperate with what I do. If you do well, I’ll speak well of you to Ja Hyeong-woo. Then maybe Ja Hyeong-woo will forgive you too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, Ja Hyeong-woo fucking hates me, so even if I speak well of you it might not work! And Ja Hyeong-woo doesn’t even know the Mouse Familiar has intelligence. But at least he’d listen if I told him this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Naturally, the Mouse Familiar got angry. It trembled so much it seemed like it would shatter into pieces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Why should I do your—}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You know Ja Hyeong-woo’s stubbornness, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s personality that both this ghost and I know well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even now, Ja Hyeong-woo and the familiar are at odds like this, so did they really immediately get along and join forces in the original work?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the original work, the Mouse Familiar realized that Ja Hyeong-woo misunderstood its intelligence and worked hard to prove its intelligence by hovering around him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, Ja Hyeong-woo wasn’t easy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Your attitude of prioritizing me alone over citizens’ lives is wrong. I won’t use you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The current standoff was essentially no different from the original work except for my interference.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, in the original work, then—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “—Servant of ‘Ja’. Come to me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Busan Gate Episode’. Among countless swarming monsters, bloodied Ja Hyeong-woo first calls his familiar and commands obedience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Mouse Familiar had also grown quite subdued by then, unable to bear the loneliness. Though angry at the master who had abandoned it until then, it was still its master. The familiar anxiously watched Ja Hyeong-woo’s miserable state and willingly threw itself at one call.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Say you protected and cared for someone you tried to kill before. Wouldn’t he find that admirable? Then Ja Hyeong-woo would acknowledge you, right?”
 </span>
