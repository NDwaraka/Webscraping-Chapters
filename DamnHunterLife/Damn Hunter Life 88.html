  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 88
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was just opening and closing his mouth, but when I put force in my eyes and stared at him, he took a bite of ice cream. The stick tip peeked out from where he bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s delicious. Thank you…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You took it out of your own fridge, you know?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, feeding him was effective. Once his tension was released, Hae Mi-jun watched the stage footage with a much more relaxed attitude from then on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, it didn’t last long. From the moment Yang Pyo in the lead charged at the first monster, his fists tensed up again and his back became overly stiff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yang Pyo-ssi, keep checking the distance with the dragon!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Yes!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both support-type tankers Jin Seol-woon and Yang Pyo entered this stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the sheep familiar and dragon familiar, both specialized in protecting allies, in one place, the will-o’-the-wisps that were this stage’s monsters couldn’t even approach the successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the giant sheep head stirred up wind once, they were pushed back that much, and when the dragon moved its body once, they tumbled away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the surface, it seemed like a combination that prioritized safety upon safety with no anxiety points at all, but that wasn’t quite right either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unlike before, the formation on screen was missing one crucial strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What was Woo Sae-geon thinking while waiting? That guy is also watching footage from his own home like me right now.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time, the Twelve Zodiac leader didn’t enter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because of this, the community was quite noisy. The news also expressed various concerns about this stage conquest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not just our successors, but the entire nation finds the strict leader Woo Sae-geon difficult yet trusts him that deeply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, he can’t stay at Hunter School forever, and the time will definitely come when he loses all his power and retires. At the close point of three months later, less than a hundred days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right now, Woo Sae-geon is nurturing the next leader.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If it follows the original work, the person who will become the next leader is…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh! Multiple talismans flew into the will-o’-the-wisps on screen as if piercing them all at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Myo Cho-hui successor! Start catching from where I attacked first.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo from the rear watched all directions while giving direct orders. Though his voice wasn’t as loud as Woo Sae-geon’s, it seemed to be delivered clearly enough when combined with communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Being fire attribute monsters, water attribute healer Ja Hyeong-woo’s attacks were particularly effective. Splash—! The will-o’-the-wisps’ light dimmed as if water had been poured on them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whoosh! The weakened will-o’-the-wisps were bound by Myo Cho-hui’s vines the next moment and dragged away. Ma Cheon-ah’s butcher knife fiercely cut through the wind, scattering the fire forms.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Cheon-ah! Don’t jump out, reposition yourself!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s loud voice rang out again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah looked displeased about receiving orders from a healer, but since it was the mouse oppa she trusted in her own way, she obediently followed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo will smoothly become the next leader.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo is a successor with rare skill controversies and a top-tier healer. He also has prudence no less than Woo Sae-geon, so it’s expected he can quell the anxiety after Woo Sae-geon’s retirement.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Above all, in the original work, Ja Hyeong-woo was also the leader. So this is an extremely natural flow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if he’s much more tender and emotional compared to the original.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even without Woo Sae-geon, Ja Hyeong-woo and the tankers continued the battle smoothly. Ma Cheon-ah still bounced around energetically, but hadn’t caused any accidents yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If there’s one strange thing…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I switched the cam to Myo Cho-hui’s perspective.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud thud, parts of vines that touched the will-o’-the-wisps burned and broke. However, Myo Cho-hui somehow steadily pulled the will-o’-the-wisps with quantity tactics and struck them with her glaive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first glance, it looked like she was fighting normally well. But.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The vine accuracy is dropping. And even considering they’re weak to fire, the durability is too weak today. Am I mistaken?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s what I think, but I don’t know how Woo Sae-geon would see it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll find out when I attend the feedback meeting later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unlike me, Hae Mi-jun had ordinary-level insight, so he didn’t notice that Myo Cho-hui’s performance was poor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But soon even Hae Mi-jun would notice an accident that occurred. Right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ah…!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They discovered the boss, and Yang Pyo and the sheep familiar charged once. Next should be Myo Cho-hui’s vine binding skill, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The skill didn’t come out properly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dozens of vine branches that were about to sprout from the ground withered and died as if drying up. Myo Cho-hui’s eyes widened and froze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Rabbit unni! What’s wrong? Are you okay?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ma Cheon-ah, focus!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quickly noticed Myo Cho-hui’s abnormality and dealt with the sudden variable. The boss was somehow smoothly subdued by the two tankers’ strength.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, that didn’t make Myo Cho-hui’s mistake disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, why is Myo Cho-hui-nim…? Didn’t her skill just fail to activate?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun panicked at main dealer Myo Cho-hui’s gap. He kept looking back at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I buried my chin in the cushion without taking my eyes off the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. Her skill didn’t activate.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s only one answer I can give.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If she staggered or collapsed, it would be poor condition like me, but that’s not it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Th-then what is it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What else? Her concentration plummeted so it didn’t activate.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I can be certain.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the very beginning of combat until now, Myo Cho-hui continuously couldn’t concentrate. Behind that peaceful face, she had other thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Somehow it’s familiar. Just the other day during training she was like that too, wasn’t she?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun and I arrived at the feedback meeting dead last. Hae Mi-jun bowed his head apologetically for being late, but I just shuffled in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The round table in the Twelve Zodiac meeting room. There were exactly 12 chairs. Since everyone was currently attending the meeting, exactly two seats were empty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You came? Sit down.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon deliberately acknowledged me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There happened to be two seats empty next to Jin Seol-woon. It seemed prepared so Hae Mi-jun and I, being close to the door, could sit right down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I seated Hae Mi-jun next to Jin Seol-woon, and I sat next to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Shortly after, Woo Sae-geon started the meeting. And as always, feedback disguised as a lecture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Detailed movement corrections later. General attitude assessment first.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What Woo Sae-geon values most and views most strictly is attitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, now is…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Group scolding time.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The footage we had been watching appeared on screen. It was conquest footage Woo Sae-geon had cut in several places for feedback.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo diligently stuck to the remote, advancing slides when Woo Sae-geon told him to advance and stopping when told to stop.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, in black martial clothes holding a great sword, was caught first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ma Cheon-ah, you should have realized that you showing off is always the problem. Today you acted even more foolishly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon was merciless even to Ma Cheon-ah, who practically had the highest monster kill contribution.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So this is how you’ll be in stages without me? Do I need to watch your training all day long from now on for you to act a little less stupidly?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No. I’ll be careful…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah was rarely dejected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From across the table, I lightly added words that could barely be heard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Still caught up in appearances. Wanting to stand out. There are unnecessary movements.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah glared at me sharply. Regardless, I was excited.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I should give lots of advice. This is when I diligently maintain my scoundrel image.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But since Woo Sae-geon also glared at me, I secretly chatted with the others from then on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yang Pyo. Your field of vision is still narrow. Do you need to crush a teammate once to come to your senses?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Sheep successor: Do you have vision problems?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Sheep successor: Well, at least your phobia improved
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Sheep successor: Now you just need to learn how to walk again, your tanking movement was inefficient
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Sheep successor&gt;Me: ;;;

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s next target for criticism was Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why don’t you know how to be bold when you need to be bold? How long will you pointlessly toy with the dragon? I told you that when there are two support-type tankers, you need to become the offensive type.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Dragon successor: Hey, the dragon is precious
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Dragon successor: You’re not a dragon, you’re a worm
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Dragon successor: Or are you a coward? Or are you half-assing it because it’s not a stage?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Dragon successor&gt;Me: Thank you for the advice. I’ll take it to heart.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, whose eyes met mine, shrugged his shoulders slightly while curling up the corners of his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That bastard is being sarcastic. Is this funny?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I moved on since the next feedback turn was Ja Hyeong-woo’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because of the next leader education purpose, Woo Sae-geon’s eyes were particularly ice-cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo, you played the leader role in the most pathetic way today. You know best what I mean.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Today Ja Hyeong-woo… definitely gave good orders. He took care of teammates well, and overall managed the conquest flow well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yet Woo Sae-geon only cursed because there’s a good reason for it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The idea of not stopping teammates from showing off and instead covering for them with preemptive healing is something you do when you’re a healer. Today you were the leader. If you do it that way, the leader will lose stamina first during conquest. Will you become a leader who collapses in the middle?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t abandon that damn healer overwork-type combat style.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Ja Hyeong-woo, though he spoke little, was far from being a pushover who couldn’t speak up. He immediately lifted his chin and looked straight at Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The mistake from before won’t happen again. Then and now are different. Now I’m watching what I can handle. Mi-jun is behind me too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was about to chat with him but stopped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Ja Hyeong-woo is particularly important, I should tell him directly with my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you that great? If you make one mistake, everyone dies, you mouse bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A gleam flashed in Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The clear gaze that hadn’t been there until just now crashed into me head-on. Ja Hyeong-woo lowered his body as if he might stand up from his chair and quickly spat out words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Healing in today’s stage was really easy. Because you weren’t there. It’s easy without just you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time since the hallucination gate, he also fought back. Instantly, a murderous atmosphere circulated over the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, really? Sorry for being weak, huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly something grabbed my sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was Hae Mi-jun’s hand. I noticed Hae Mi-jun, looking somewhat shrunk, wanting to stop this situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Sa Ye-ho from the seat next to him looked at Hae Mi-jun and pushed his head across the round table. Grinning while winking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey hey. Don’t be scared. Those bastards just said ‘Don’t overdo it.’ and ‘Don’t worry. You just need to be okay.’ in that shitty way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not it, so shut up, you snake bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah, I’ll shut up. Our Gang-mouse.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Be quiet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Woo Sae-geon’s low voice rang out, we all shut our mouths at once.
 </span>
