  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 100
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This hunter bastard seems to have just dissed me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My English is good enough to understand what they’re saying without an interpreter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The advantage is that I don’t have to stand there looking stupid like those guys because I don’t understand what the other side is saying, and the disadvantage is that I directly understand the content and nuance of what Agni is saying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni is a character who wasn’t in the original work, so I need to observe and figure out his characteristics and tendencies now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he just told me something like I should be lying in a hospital.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I fight back or not? Just ignore it?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No matter how much I hear this from other successors all the time, hearing it from a guy who’s not even Korean before a team competition was completely different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly I felt someone’s presence next to me. As soon as I realized who it was, I swiftly brushed away the sleeve that almost touched me as if I’d touched germs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether I did that or not, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes only glared at Agni. His gaze was so vicious it seemed like a fight would break out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did he just make sexual remarks to you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Huh. Ma Cheon-ah quietly gasped. Sa Ye-ho burst out laughing with a “Puhak!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah sorry. 「This guy doesn’t speak English well so he misunderstood the word. Don’t take it to heart」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho explained to the bewildered American hunters. He even used English directly for quick communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho may look like this but he’s from a prestigious university business department, so he speaks English fluently. Woo Sae-geon, who’s standing quietly beside him, probably understands perfectly too, but seems to deliberately only speak Korean.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, Ma Cheon-ah has never studied in her life so she can barely understand anything other than Korean. Ja Hyeong-woo is even worse. The level of Ja Hyeong-woo’s second foreign language that I saw in the original work was stuck at elementary school lower grades.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that didn’t seem to be a problem for Ja Hyeong-woo, at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whatever you said, apologize. If you can only open your eyes like that, keep them down. You know your gaze only gets dirty when you look at Gang-hyeon? Are you doing it on purpose?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why did Ja Hyeong-woo’s personality become so fucking awful?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard Ja Hyeong-woo got absorbed in his own world, clenched his molars tight and snapped, then even glared at the interpreter to urge them to translate quickly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It must have been such an overreaction that even Woo Sae-geon added a comment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ox Successor: Ja Hyeong-woo
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ox Successor: What are you doing?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ox Successor: Don’t act rashly. It’s true that blue-eyed bastard said something annoying. However, in a situation where it might just be a remark made to provoke, if you get worked up, only our side will look strange.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ox Successor: Set 1 is in just a few hours. Get your composure back. Do I have to tell you everything?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ox Successor: Don’t you know that you don’t have the brains to have made that reaction strategically just now?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah… the nagging is a bit long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t stupid either, so he would have gradually understood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’ll regret it in a bit too. That getting worked up actually ended up being for my sake.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Me: Hey leader
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Me: Just say he used a fake right now too
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Me: Ja Hyeong-woo will become a wooden statue again when we get to the actual match anyway
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Still, he did get angry on my behalf.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni finally gave a half-hearted apology. With eyes like a preschooler who doesn’t even know they did something wrong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Sorry. I guess I made you feel bad」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Horse Successor: That superficially slick bastard, I’ll bet my Chollima’s fur that he’s not sincere
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「We apologize for our team member’s rudeness. Shall we sit down for now」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bootsman’s polite suggestion overlaps with Ma Cheon-ah’s fuming chat window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, her actual face showed no sign of anger. Did Ma Cheon-ah know how to put on a poker face?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Thank you」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grinned and responded to Bootsman’s words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Snake Successor: Agni this little shit originally has a bad boy image in his own country too, just searched it up
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was at the level of having split personality between his outward appearance and inner thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ox Successor: Just sit down for now.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Horse Successor: Yes
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Maybe because we often chat even during battles, this level of multitasking is nothing to us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for one person, the technology-challenged computer illiterate Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who wasn’t used to chatting, was clumsy at handling his gaze going back and forth between the front and the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I glanced near Ja Hyeong-woo’s chin just to spy, I accidentally made eye contact again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ah shit…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My face rapidly heated up again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m going to die of embarrassment because of that damn dream. The strange sensation is still lingering.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since I can’t splash water twice, I sharply turned my head and focused on mind control.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The introductions took so long that we’re only now getting to sit down a bit. The American side sat in a long row across from us, so we just need to sit on this side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I should sit at the end.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when I lifted my head, Woo Sae-geon was already sitting at the left end and Ja Hyeong-woo at the right end at light speed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What is this déjà vu?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I hesitated, the remaining seats quickly disappeared. Sa Ye-ho went to sit next to Woo Sae-geon, and Ma Cheon-ah, perhaps wanting the center, didn’t hesitate to take the middle position.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then the remaining seat is…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fuck.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A curse I don’t usually use came out automatically at the feeling that the world was picking on me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouldn’t frown.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Conscious of Agni’s gaze following my face, I relaxed my eyes as much as possible. I pulled over the chair next to Ja Hyeong-woo and sat down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Flinch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand jerked greatly. His entire arm froze while pulling the soup the waiter (this person is also a hunter) had set down closer to him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why are you surprised?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon Ja Hyeong-woo’s arm smoothly brought the soup to the front of his torso. As Ja Hyeong-woo bent his arm joint, his elbow came close to below my chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gasp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This time I flinched my right arm. I folded my shoulder to avoid touching Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Did you two have a fight or something」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni interfered as expected. Still with that innocent face. I answered with complete disregard.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While the full course meal was being served, Sa Ye-ho showed his streamer experience by exclusively handling conversation with the American hunters while secretly chatting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Me: More info on Agni
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Me: This bastard won’t introduce himself to the end
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Snake Successor: Fire-type gunner, popular because he’s handsome
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Snake Successor: You know America has privatized gates, right? It’s a guild system there. There are many awakened so it feels like a red ocean
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Snake Successor: So competition among hunters is incredibly fierce. Agni’s role is provoking hunters from other guilds, but that’s also his charm to his guild fans
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Snake Successor: It doesn’t seem like it’s specifically because our Gang-jji looks like he’d fall over with one poke??? He’s just originally that kind of bastard
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The person in the original work was also the same fire-type gunner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So how is Agni different from the original… his personality is different. The original hunter had a stern feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right, since I’m a scoundrel, let’s say they balanced the personality.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems Agni is probably the American team’s Gyeon Gang-hyeon. Thinking of it that way, I could empathize and felt more comfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Come to think of it, it’s surprising that neither Woo Sae-geon nor Ma Cheon-ah are saying I deserved to get picked on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They’ll pick on me themselves, but they can’t let foreigners pick on me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The meal was extremely awkward. I thought it was a blind date. It would have been hopeless if Sa Ye-ho couldn’t speak English.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Taking advantage of the fact that most were teenage to 20-something hunters, insider Sa Ye-ho found topics on his own. He was worth a hundred in both conversation and reactions. Combined with Bootsman’s social skills, it was perfect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「I really like the traditional outfits you’re wearing. Did you design them yourself」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Try it on! I’ll specially lend it to you」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Oh my…」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho jokingly grabbed his skirt hem and stood up abruptly. Bootsman made a face like he’d been caught and slowly pulled his chair back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Ah, would Bootsman like to try it on once? Some people chose their clothes thinking for themselves, and some people had no ideas whatsoever so coordinators dressed them」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Haha, well… first, I think you chose yours directly」!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「How did you know」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then they talked about gate hardships and such. Mainly the American hunters, especially leader Bootsman and hot-blooded Buster, exploded with questions. Korea’s Hunter School and stage system would be fascinating to them too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho entertained the Americans appropriately without a single verbal mistake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <strong>
  Snake Successor: Hyung just do what hyung does well, I’ll handle the Americans myself

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What Woo Sae-geon does well? Sitting with arms crossed looking ominous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiche, whether he was like their Woo Sae-geon (personality-wise), didn’t speak. He just nibbled at his food silently, looking quite displeased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, his expression became considerably better after dessert came out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There was TMI in the original that he was a dessert maniac… Well, this isn’t information that helps in battle.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte had a fairly intimate conversation with Ma Cheon-ah, who was around her age, through the interpreter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Actually, I was hoping Innate’s Esi would come to the competition. Then I probably would have lost to the Korean team on purpose」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whoa, you like Innate?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Yeah. Seeing Esi gave me fantasies about Asian men」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uh… would you prefer getting Esi’s autograph, or touching an S-grade sword made by Esi? Should I ask this? Because the white kid next to me has Esi’s sword.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah said that while calling out me, who was quietly eating. She even pointed with her finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte’s gaze came to me once, then lingered on me for quite a while. Then she soon shrugged and dropped her gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Thanks. I’ll go with Esi’s autograph for now. I’d be jealous seeing a gift that Esi gave someone with his heart in it」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What do you mean.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though she was an American hunter I was meeting for the first time, I replied curtly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte just laughed lightly.
 </span>
