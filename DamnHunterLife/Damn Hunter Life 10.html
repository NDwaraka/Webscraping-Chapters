  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 10
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though it was just one word. And it came from the drunkard Gyeon Gang-hyeon at that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, Hae Mi-jun bowed his head and expressed his gratitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Thank you so much! Gang, Gang-hyeon-nim?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What’s with the nim.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Call me hyung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes… Yes! Hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I avoided his gaze because Hae Mi-jun’s stare was burdensome. Hae Mi-jun didn’t know this and just grinned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then, then it’s the last place alliance? Between us?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a ridiculous thing to say, but he wasn’t being sarcastic. He innocently thought that name was cool and was happy about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I let out a light laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sure, whatever.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was at it, I extended my right hand to the kid. It seemed like the right timing for a handshake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun brightened up as expected.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was quite short and his face still had baby fat. But I was surprised that the hand that firmly gripped mine was as big as mine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As much as his calloused fingertips showed, he must have been training with all his might.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in the hopeless darkness where no direction was visible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then we need a place to secretly meet…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “A secret place?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A bright face that might as well have ‘I’m excited!’ written on it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I just nodded roughly at his energy that was hard to keep up with.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I think it would be good to meet away from others’ eyes?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. But how?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There weren’t many places where we could meet while avoiding the eyes of other Twelve Zodiac members, students, and the world.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there was one certain thing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun. I don’t know if it’s an error or what, but even though I haven’t awakened, teleportation to me seems possible?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The point being that Hae Mi-jun would probably also be able to teleport to me. Just like Ja Hyeong-woo did before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Good thing. Both Ja Hyeong-woo and Hae Mi-jun are guys who don’t suspect this kind of bullshit…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You could come to my house. How about it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, Hae Mi-jun stuttered three times when answering that he understood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I’m tired from working out right now and my eyes are closing? Let me sleep for two hours and after dinner, let’s meet at my house at 7 PM.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That evening, Hae Mi-jun stood in front of his closet for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m going to train. Formal wear won’t do. Comfortable clothes, comfortable clothes. But isn’t there something comfortable that can still show respect—’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even dried his hair and used hair wax, then was nervous until the appointment time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I go 5 minutes early? No, that won’t do. It would be rude if he’s not ready.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right on time? But what if Gang-hyeon hyung isn’t ready yet?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I go 5 minutes late? But then that’s being late!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After agonizing over this once-in-a-lifetime dilemma, Hae Mi-jun’s choice was 1 minute before the appointment time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Moving to Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s location.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The air of an unfamiliar interior enveloped his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun looked around and quickly found the homeowner, and was startled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hy, hyung. What is that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, sitting on the sofa, answered nonchalantly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you tell by looking? I removed the oxygen tank from an oxygen breathing apparatus and left only the mask and hose.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes. But why did you connect masks to both sides?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun wasn’t asking because he didn’t know what the object Gyeon Gang-hyeon was holding with the long hose wrapped around his arm was. As he said, it was a configuration where the manufacturing process could be quickly inferred, but it was still such a strange form he’d never seen before that he asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A breathing apparatus is a tool for receiving air supply from an oxygen tank, but if there are masks on both ends of the hose like that, instead of an oxygen tank, would you receive breath from a person… Huh?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun froze stiff where he stood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He came here because Gyeon Gang-hyeon called him. Believing Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s words that he would somehow help raise his abilities.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then, could that possibly be?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. This is the training equipment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon calmly confirmed it. Hae Mi-jun’s mouth fell open with a face like he was about to collapse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, hyung and I will then, with that… really?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not joking.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s face turned red as if he’d heard something he shouldn’t have. Gyeon Gang-hyeon calmly began persuading him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You know our abilities follow the five elements, and the five elements are related to the qi and blood flow in the human body, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Actually, I don’t know much about traditional medicine either. I need to take classes. Anyway, there’s one thing you can know without knowing that stuff, right? The awakening abilities of successors are imbued in the breath going in and out of the lungs, in the blood flowing through blood vessels.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If awakening abilities were an area mastered through studying with letters or repeated body movements, Hae Mi-jun should have already surpassed Ja Hyeong-woo, beaten Woo Sae-geon, and even become a leader. Because he worked twice as hard as others.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the fact that he couldn’t meant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll be honest. Hae Mi-jun, you’re just clumsy at operating the energy in your body. You were born lacking control. In terms of dancing, you’re like someone with no sense of rhythm.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, I know. That’s why I should have worked harder—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It wasn’t something that could be done with effort. Anyway, now do you understand what I’m trying to do?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now. Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had pulled up the corners of his mouth, thrust one side of the breathing apparatus toward Hae Mi-jun.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun hesitantly took it. Then the two people’s bodies became connected by the hose linking the breathing apparatus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You just need to use this breathing apparatus and try breathing with my breath. My breathing will align the qi in your body. My hypothesis is that you’ll realize something at some point while doing this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was finally notified by Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s mouth of the purpose of this breathing apparatus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s hand holding the breathing apparatus trembled. He felt like he was going to die because his face was turning red and his heart was beating too fast, but it was hard to understand how Gang-hyeon hyung could propose this so calmly. His head felt dizzy. He thought he understood what it meant to say someone might faint from embarrassment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Really, it was difficult to manage his expression. Enough for Gyeon Gang-hyeon to notice his agitation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon uncrossed his right leg. Resting his elbow on his knee and bringing his upper body closer to Hae Mi-jun, he whispered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I brushed my teeth. You did too, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a joke to try to change Hae Mi-jun’s expression, but it only had the opposite effect. Because Hae Mi-jun started hiccupping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Gyeon Gang-hyeon get a sense of why Hae Mi-jun was acting like this. Could it be that this kid, at the height of his vigorous youth, was having improper thoughts? Between the same men, about something close to CPR?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun. Don’t think of this strangely. I’m 5 years older than you. Don’t touch what you shouldn’t.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes, yes. Hic!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He answered really well. Gyeon Gang-hyeon looked at him distrustfully then gestured. Hae Mi-jun creakily sat down beside the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s do it. Just breathe slowly and deeply. Precisely, you’ll be breathing the air that went in and out of my lungs… We’ll match the rhythm as we go. Don’t keep taking off the mask just because it’s not working well. We’ll suffocate to death.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s a method that never appeared in the original novel, but well, it would be no fun if the characters in the story suddenly grew through such tricks, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I even practiced earlier by summoning the Mouse Familiar to human size. The result was ‘effective.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Gyeon Gang-hyeon put on the breathing apparatus first and waited, Hae Mi-jun hurriedly put on his own. He was so flustered that he missed the timing to politely ask ‘But hyung isn’t an awakened person and has a different attribute, will it really work?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only regular breathing sounds remained in the quiet living room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun, who had been quietly breathing, naturally closed his eyes. Amazingly, when he did as Gang-hyeon hyung told him, the cool energy in his chest grew stronger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was real. Because of the other person’s breathing, his own breath was being interfered with in a way, but he felt good.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I just do this and the energy grows a little more… skill manifestation might be possible too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before he knew it, Hae Mi-jun was breathing deeply inside the breathing apparatus. Forgetting the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Gyeon Gang-hyeon removed the breathing apparatus and coughed. Hae Mi-jun’s eyes flew open.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m, I’m sorry!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fine. Ah, take off your shirt too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon, who had stopped coughing, suddenly pointed at Hae Mi-jun’s t-shirt. Hae Mi-jun jumped and unconsciously covered his chest with his hands. His face reddened again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I need to touch some bare skin. I think the connection will deepen that way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But, but.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hesitation was clearly evident in his words. Gyeon Gang-hyeon narrowed his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This appeared in the original work too, and Ja Hyeong-woo should be doing this right now too?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo also, as a teacher, places his hand on Hae Mi-jun’s bare back and helps control his energy. Since there were no immediate effects, Ja Hyeong-woo, for whom his own training was more important, probably put it on hold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hurry up. I said it’s good to do it together with the breathing apparatus.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun hesitantly undressed while watching Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s reaction. Immediately Gyeon Gang-hyeon placed his left palm over his heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gasp!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the cold hand touched his skin, his body almost jumped up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His heart was pounding too much. Hyung would feel it all, it was so embarrassing. Hae Mi-jun made a tearful face and used the breathing apparatus again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What’s with this high school freshman.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s upper body was quite broad and covered with even muscles. Gyeon Gang-hyeon thought of his own body that was nothing but bones and white skin and felt a deep reality check.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The unknown fluttering was brief, and Hae Mi-jun focused all his nerves on breathing again. Not forgetting this sensation of the power of water resonating within his body, he grasped and grasped the power so he could draw out energy on his own. Beads of sweat even formed on his forehead.
 </span>

  Hae Mi-jun’s eyes went round and he hurriedly removed the mask. He even pushed away Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s hand and placed his palm on his own heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the moment Hae Mi-jun obtained his first skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How much he had wanted to see this message, how much he had sat down in the training ground to catch his breath and hold back tears flashed through his mind like a panorama. Hae Mi-jun’s eyes grew moist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon smiled crookedly as if he knew all of Hae Mi-jun’s feelings.
 </span>

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It works, man.”
 </span>
</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The movement of vivid red lips even within the foggy breathing apparatus.

<p>

  Hae Mi-jun’s gaze was captivated by that red color for a while.
