<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just then, Agni butted in again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Mm, if Clyte were to try to steal Dog’s sword, Dog really wouldn’t even be able to resist! It’d be better not to take it out of inventory at all」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard, just when I’d forgotten about him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t particularly respond to that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: That Agni bastard is really being clingy with the puppy
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho must have heard even from that distance, as he badmouthed Agni in the chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Ja Hyeong-woo said another word to Agni.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t talk to Gang-hyeon from now on. I’m warning you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni really acted like a kid. He didn’t want to join Sa Ye-ho, Bootsman, and Buster’s lively conversation, but he also didn’t want to play alone like Quiche, so he kept bouncing around here and there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Always in a way that picked fights with Korean hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Is that person in a bad mood」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni pointed at Woo Sae-geon and asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With that pathetic face, either not knowing he’d touched a taboo or knowing but acting clueless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence spread.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Ma Cheon-ah and Clyte, who had been conversing a bit away, naturally stopped talking. Due to the wordless, chilling atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon surely could speak perfect English, he just chose not to. But that made it even more frightening that he said nothing at all. His pupils slowly rolled toward Agni, who was far across the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his torso and chin completely fixed, only blade-like light planted in his black, venomous pupils.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone at this table could tell that Woo Sae-geon had just dominated the table with his presence alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This wasn’t just about dropping some reckless spirit trying to climb onto the table back to the floor. It was pressure that could send them plummeting off a cliff and still have strength left over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What the hell is in that guy’s head?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How can someone just two years older than me have that kind of intimidating presence?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only now am I certain. Woo Sae-geon isn’t afraid or puzzled about being Korea’s number one hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even I, just watching, felt my whole body freeze and shiver, so what about Agni who was being directly stared down?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Agni, please…」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind Bootsman’s sigh, when no one could bring themselves to speak—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was one person who unfailingly stepped forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sound of Sa Ye-ho’s small chuckle broke the silence. Sa Ye-ho looked back at Agni with a bright smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Our leader is shy around strangers. Isn’t it cute」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Uh… yeah…」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni, who had been frozen stiff, trembled his eyes and agreed with difficulty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon didn’t stop Sa Ye-ho at all. He withdrew his gaze, letting the snow mountain-like atmosphere at the table melt away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…Are those two having a one-on-one chat right now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I think I understand. Why Woo Sae-geon always lets Sa Ye-ho be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in what seems like Sa Ye-ho being the only one who can manipulate Woo Sae-geon, Woo Sae-geon’s intentions have always existed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time, I’m making a judgment about the relationship between these two characters. It’s a hypothesis about content that didn’t appear in the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon and Sa Ye-ho are partners.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the meal reached its final stages, the original tension gradually returned. It was because they remembered that in a moment, they’d have to cross swords instead of water glasses with the opponents in front of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「The familiars seemed quite extraordinary. I would have liked to see them if given the chance」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Unfortunately, your side blocked it, didn’t you? Saying familiar summoning during matches is cheating.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was answering with a smile, but the confrontation had already begun from the moment he started answering in Korean instead of English.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「The match rules might be too disadvantageous for the Korean side」.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, we’ll know once we try, right? Some of us barely use familiars, or don’t use them at all.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first part refers to me, the latter to Ja Hyeong-woo. Someone who supposedly doesn’t have one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprisingly, even Woo Sae-geon still doesn’t know that Ja Hyeong-woo has manifested a familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know how Ja Hyeong-woo plans to handle the aftermath of this either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I need to somehow induce changes in my body to become independent from the mouse familiar.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’ll definitely accomplish it and return the mouse familiar to Ja Hyeong-woo before the latter half of the original story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I glanced sideways at Ja Hyeong-woo, whose eating pace had become vigorous since Agni quieted down. Fortunately, our eyes didn’t meet this time either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if Ja Hyeong-woo faces some crisis…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know he’ll think it’s right for his familiar to protect me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem is that I know this too well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was already uncomfortable, and now I felt even more awkward. My heart pounded anxiously inside my ribcage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I set down my utensils with a clatter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eat more.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s voice suddenly pierced my right ear. All the fine hairs on my body stood up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was the first words Ja Hyeong-woo had said to me today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I demonstrated the stamina to not say a single word until the end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Really, what’s wrong with you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, I had to deal with Ma Cheon-ah’s disgruntled tone with my back and shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I had sprung up and toppled over to the opposite side, Ma Cheon-ah had caught me in the confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For someone grumbling, she surprisingly didn’t drop me on the floor, so I thought she was managing her image too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A dry wind blows across the empty field.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even knowing it’s artificial wind, the first round arena where everything is as real as Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How much magic stone did America pour into this place?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if awakeners created the space, the operating energy needed to maintain it would have had to be supplied with magic stones. Magic stones by the crateful—they sure have a lot of money.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the 1st to 3rd set matches, the ‘Death Game’ has only one very simple rule.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Kill the entire opposing team starting now.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Five members from each camp line up facing each other. Just like they had at the dining table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, this time there’s quite a distance between them. The opposing team was as far as a soccer goal, and even among our own team members there was enough distance that we’d have to shout for our voices to be heard. Even Ja Hyeong-woo right next to me looks small.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The team with the last survivor wins.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Additionally, if multiple survivors remain after 10 minutes, victory is determined by calculating the number of eliminated team members and time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though the game rules were simple, actually putting real people into a game was never simple.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For example, to realize the HP bar function above our heads, the American Association would have gone through months of trial and error.
 </span>
</p>

  ‘Look at Sa Ye-ho. His mouth is stretched ear to ear.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The game streamer on hiatus, the game addict, looked happy to have become a character inside a game himself. He covered his mouth in emotion looking at the HP bar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Look at that. He came fully prepared.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So excited about entering a game, he even wore the headband that would have been removed on stage for interfering with combat. What a real attention-seeker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, when the HP bars reflecting actual physical durability were all depleted, it was ‘death’ (since we’re real people, we decided to call it elimination).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Upon elimination, you move to the waiting area and spectate the remaining team from then on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, during this game, our bodies are covered with a protective barrier that perfectly absorbs damage from sword strikes and such. It doesn’t actually wound our bodies, but instead causes dizziness proportional to the damage to provide a pain effect.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since our actual lives weren’t at stake and there was no worry about bodily injury…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Although there are skill restrictions, this match might be an opportunity for successors to rampage without regard for consequences.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first set, a first for everyone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’ll start the first set by testing the waters. They look ready to charge in boldly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s light briefing from the waiting room came to mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon, stick to Ja Hyeong-woo as soon as it starts.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had instructed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strategy that chose to try keeping everyone alive for the first attempt, since losing even one person would be disadvantageous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But why, why did it have to be Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you just abandon me? Let the remaining members handle it themselves. Think about it carefully. It might be better to just abandon me and go rather than waste energy. The leader can get those kills anyway.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Healing me is honestly like pouring water into a bottomless pot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then Ja Hyeong-woo…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He glared and growled low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We’re going with protecting everyone. I’m a healer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t I know you’re a healer?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly I remembered what Woo Sae-geon had said before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That if Ja Hyeong-woo faced a situation where he could only save one person between someone else and me, Ja Hyeong-woo would save me with great relief.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No way…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buuuu—! The starting horn sounded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hastily stopped my other thoughts and focused ahead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected, First Call charged fiercely toward us before the horn sound even ended. Leading was Buster the tanker, followed by Agni the gunner rushing behind him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Making direct eye contact with me, charging at full speed toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as I saw Woo Sae-geon’s scholar’s robe blocking their path, my body, which had been standing still, was sucked in and buried somewhere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Ja Hyeong-woo’s embrace.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Of all places, my waist and stomach—!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo succeeded in pulling me into his arms. But the moment his muscular arm pressed firmly against my abdomen, I ended up kicking Ja Hyeong-woo with my heel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Damn this cursed dream!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte caught my opening. Despite Ma Cheon-ah’s marking, a throwing dagger rolled from her hand. And—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The HP window turning bright red.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Severe dizziness struck. My knees buckled completely and I rolled on the dirt ground. After my body rolled over once, harsh coughing burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I barely managed to lift my eyelids, more than half my HP had been chopped off. My eyes bulged. But more than that…!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni was mounted on top of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With his gun barrel aimed at my forehead, Agni grinned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Softer than you look」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this moment, I was barely pulling back my bowstring with my right elbow almost touching the ground. Gritting my teeth, I released the arrow with a snap.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whit—!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Agni dodged the close-range arrow just by tilting his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Bang」~!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gun barrel flashed with fire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was nothing I could do. I squeezed my eyes shut.
