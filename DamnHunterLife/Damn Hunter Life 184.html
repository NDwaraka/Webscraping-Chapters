  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 184
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The metal of the armor melted in streams and stuck to the bamboo surface. Smoke rose up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s speed was so fast that I could only follow his movements by the trajectory of fire igniting on the giant’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crack! The eerie sound of metal crumpling and deforming traveled through my entire body. The giant flailed around, unable to find or catch the small human tearing up its body with its eyes or hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Whew……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With the giant soldier burning and collapsing in flames as backdrop, Sa Ye-ho staggered over. Though he looked terrible, his spirit seemed refreshed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Other giants were gradually being dealt with outside my field of vision too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though Ma Cheon-ah had consumed a lot of skills, she had also safely taken down a giant soldier, and Won Ha-ri likewise.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;When You Die, Everyone Becomes Earth (Earth Attribute)&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, I threw an advanced skill and blew up the giant soldier’s head. The headless body toppled over.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, there was a silence that made me deeply sigh. Jin Seol-woon, who had been drawing attention by crossing between the giant soldiers on his dragon, slowed down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though some mobs still remained, the urgent situation seemed to have concluded for now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But right then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crack! A giant burning arm struck down where Sa Ye-ho had been.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uhhng……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, the response came from nearby.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite taking a perfect hit to the back of his head, he had somehow dodged with that trembling body. Sa Ye-ho, who had instantly gotten onto the dog familiar, was leaning against me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than nearly dying just now—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why……?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho looked up at the giant soldier rising again with a bewildered face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had definitely been enough attack to cut off its breath, I had seen Sa Ye-ho’s fire properly melt the giant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The giant soldier was getting up again in a damaged state. Not just one, but all four of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially the giant soldier whose whole body was burning bright red from Sa Ye-ho’s influence was threatening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Another one had armor broken into pieces that clattered, someone was slashed up by swords. The last one moved without even a head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Devastatingly, all the revived giant soldiers emanated the same strange energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t their original metal attribute, but felt like something had been layered over it. As if some other soul had entered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They didn’t just come back to life, they became beings that can’t die!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sense of defeat stabbed deep into my lungs. My breathing became a little short.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I was insufficient. There seem to be Hwan-hon-seok that my abilities can’t detect.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But there was no time to despair either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threw the energy-drained Sa Ye-ho to Ja Hyeong-woo to heal. The giants tried to charge threateningly like before. I led my team members again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri spun her sword hilt several times in her hand. Her glittering eyes faced the giant soldier looking down on her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Crack, thin ice momentarily formed on the fire giant’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun breathed precariously as if he had grabbed the giant’s leash. The flames that had been blazing with shimmering heat waves just around the area seemed about to dim a little, then soon flared up even bigger. Enough to dry up the water instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hae Mi-jun, don’t overdo it!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the midst of shouting, Ja Hyeong-woo embraced me from behind and drew out energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The small but quick mouse familiar filled with powerful water energy shot out. The mouse familiar moved its feet quickly, circling around the burning giant. Whoosh! Water poured over the armor.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Take out one ordered skill each!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I allowed more skill usage than expected because of the revived giants.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo knelt on one knee and panted. Meanwhile, Jin Seol-woon was handling the giant soldier on that side. The dragon’s body struck the giant soldier hard then slid smoothly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t overdo it, rest before moving! In the meantime, I’ll—!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dragon’s tail was firmly caught in the giant soldier’s hand. Jin Seol-woon’s cry was also cut short.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The giant soldier roughly grabbed and threw the tail. The dragon was bent and flew in the completely opposite direction from where it had originally been heading.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon also went flying, but the flying dragon barely caught its master with its mouth. The dragon familiar crashed into the ground with a tremendous roar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, I was gritting my teeth and shooting an arrow toward that giant’s nape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The giant lowered its head to cover its nape. Clang! The arrow that hit the helmet bounced off.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I even put an intermediate skill into it……!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were still regular soldiers that hadn’t been dealt with scattered around. The encirclement was gradually tightening, and there were more soldiers properly swinging spears at least once than soldiers dying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I finally declared retreat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop attacking! Focus on dodging!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At my single word, everyone quickly mounted their familiars. We hurriedly pulled back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We caught our breath for the moment, but we still had to somehow deal with the giants constantly threatening from above.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the Hwan-hon-seok are buried deep underground where even I can’t see them. Should we just dig up all the ground recklessly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I calculated the skills of earth attribute successors while gauging the strength I had left, driving the dog familiar without stopping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……There’s one. An existence that could track down earth attribute Hwan-hon-seok even better than me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked back at successor Myo Cho-hui, who had been diverting the giant’s attention with vines.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Myo Cho-hui. You’ve used most of your skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her hair that had been tied in two braids was completely undone and disheveled, and her eyes were tired. The vitality of the vines had also noticeably decreased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t mean Myo Cho-hui would see the Hwan-hon-seok better than me. Myo Cho-hui and I had failed together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I’m going to call a higher-grade existence.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me your energy and return.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it’s the Azure Dragon that governs the East, it could turn over all the earth and smash the Hwan-hon-seok.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui had the rabbit familiar lure the giant, then leaped onto the front of the dog familiar I was riding. She sat with her legs pressed against the fluffy dog’s nape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Facing each other, both our hair fluttered. Myo Cho-hui’s loosened hair gradually brushed against me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I swallowed my saliva.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is because, well, I’m worried it might be fatal yin energy for me too. That’s why I’m afraid of having to make physical contact with successor Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tension stemming from survival instinct resonated through my skin. I wondered if I should reach out my hand first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Myo Cho-hui’s light brown eyes captured me. Definitely hating the loose-mouthed delinquent Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At her voice filled with something, I got goosebumps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’ve kept my parents alive, everyone’s parents, everyone’s children until now. You’re a hero.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I looked down at the small hand extended toward me on the running familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I was a bit dazed by Myo Cho-hui’s handshake request, I responded in time. I completely covered the small hand with my grasp.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A dragon god imbued with piercingly fresh blue-green foliage soared into the sky. I saw an illusion as if my vision was covered with lush green trees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Cough, a cough burst from me. Ja Hyeong-woo who had been behind me all along, and Myo Cho-hui who had approached on her knees from the front simultaneously caught me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I raised my head to look at Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Myo Cho-hui’s form disappeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had said “return” earlier. Literally. In this stage, I was worried that the original work’s final chapter would take away my team members.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Beom I-ryeong started it first.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rebuilt the system that had been broken once then, in my own way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now stages aren’t hell where you can’t get out until you die or completely succeed in strategy. With just my command, you can exit mid-stage and re-enter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Even if this affects me somehow later, I won’t let the abilities I have rot away.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had all the water attribute regular hunters on standby outside the stage at school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They would pool their strength bit by bit to restore successors, and the restored successors would rejoin the gate strategy team. Even if all skills were exhausted, basic strength would be helpful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……I told my team members this for now. Then all team members agreed to accept return when that time came.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Azure Dragon dives deep into the pond called earth. Though the soil is suffocatingly heavy, it couldn’t encroach on the Azure Dragon’s vitality at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The divine being churned through the ground in winding motions, exterminating what shouldn’t exist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before my eyes, the giant hit by an arrow collapsed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “HP is decreasing! The Hwan-hon-seok are gone!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at the same time, the Juk-yeop-gun also seemed to recognize that the situation was turning unfavorable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An ear-piercing tinnitus like metal clashing rang out. I squinted one eye while raising my voice even louder. Though my throat hurt as if it would tear, I shouted and ordered the next action.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the Juk-yeop-gun raged more fiercely than before, as if prepared to die.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood-draining combat continued. For every fallen Juk-yeop-gun, bloodstains increased on exhausted team members too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Starting with Myo Cho-hui, I expelled team members who had reached their limits one by one outside the stage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who was throwing daggers while being caught up by the sharp spear tips of Juk-yeop-gun in exhaustion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo, who had knocked down giants hundreds of times until his insides were all injured and he was spitting blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, whose Chollima was torn to death and who had injured her leg and fallen to the ground while still swinging her sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though they weren’t dead like in that scene from memory, it gouged at my eyes just as much. Even so, I didn’t close my eyes and focused only on moving them to safety with proper timing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while doing this, I continued shooting arrows without stopping to save the remaining team members. I didn’t forget to struggle until the very end.
 </span>
