  Woo Sae-geon remained silent. I guess he thought I responded somewhat unexpectedly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though I lost something, I succeeded in notifying him that I wouldn’t be under surveillance from you, Woo Sae-geon, anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after ending the communication, I was lost in thought for a while.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had awakened and succeeded in being accepted by people as a member of the successors. But this wasn’t the end of everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What I needed next was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Making the real power of the Twelve Zodiac convinced of me.”
 </span>

  Since I hadn’t been talking to myself lately, the status window had been keeping its mouth shut too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hearing the status window’s comment after a long time cured my low blood pressure a bit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The communication had already ended, but suddenly a chat came from Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Ox Successor &gt; Me: Prepare for broadcasting.

  I was going to appear on a successor talk show for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon, who had sent the chat, lowered his arms from the conference room table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until then, he looked back at another person who had been nailed to the chair on the opposite side of the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re not going?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unlike Woo Sae-geon who had his hair in a topknot, Ja Hyeong-woo was wearing hwarang clothes but hadn’t tied his hair. It could be seen as a somewhat relaxed appearance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he absolutely never went when asked, Ja Hyeong-woo immediately jumped up from his seat as soon as those words fell. Without saying he was going, the conference room door slammed shut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was after hearing that Gang-hyeon wasn’t coming.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Left alone, Woo Sae-geon leaned back against his chair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the successors, the person with the biggest difference between public image and actual appearance was definitely Myo Cho-hui.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Woo Sae-geon thinks Ja Hyeong-woo isn’t far behind either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A hero devoted to the nation, my ass. A bastard who’s been obsessed with just one guy from start to finish.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s retreating figure leaving the doorway. Gang-hyeon who had just finished communication.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can see that this side’s weakness is that side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does it work in reverse too?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He’d wanted to experiment with that sometime.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The day of the talk show filming dawned. I stepped foot into the filming studio in the Hunter School building. It was my first time entering this place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like talk shows commonly seen on TV programs, it seemed to be structured so that successors would sit one by one at each table in a row.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Normally, a host would sit in the middle position, and PDs would be swarming behind the cameras…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But this was a special space where only hunters could be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This broadcast was one where all broadcast producers including the host had to work remotely. They succeeded in expanding camera angles somehow with the system’s help. Something about extending screen functions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If even PDs can’t be beside us, naturally there are no coordinators or makeup professionals either.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, outfits are fixed as hunter uniforms, and since we’re not celebrities where faces matter, makeup isn’t necessary either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But some people do it themselves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was walking around carrying a box that was his personal item. He caught every successor who entered and held up makeup tools. He also did something lightly on his own face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Yang Pyo entered. As soon as Jin Seol-woon saw his face, he started scolding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I told you to sleep a lot the night before. Is this the skin of someone who slept enough?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m sorry…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come closer.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo approached Jin Seol-woon, who was gesturing, hesitantly. Sigh. I quietly sent Yang Pyo a text.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [That’s why I told you not to show off]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [When you can’t sleep, call me and sleep next to me]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Stupid bastard]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A reply came shortly after.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [ㅠㅠ But my insomnia is really getting better… These days I don’t wear the mask skill more often, so this is improvement, which is why I didn’t get scolded much by Jin Seol-woon hyung just now]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Well, that’s fortunate]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, with focused eyes, patted Yang Pyo’s face with a cushion. Rather than being generous-hearted, I thought he was doing this because these were members who would appear on the same screen as him. Perfectionism hoping for propriety even if not as much as the Innate group, something like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon briefly held onto Ja Hyeong-woo who said it wasn’t necessary, then came to me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s an honor to have Esi do my makeup.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Close your eyes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even after waiting quite a while, nothing touched my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I opened my eyes, black pupils were too close. As soon as our eyes met, Jin Seol-woon immediately pulled his upper body back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah. I was checking closely. You don’t need makeup. You have no color in your face, so I’ll just cover that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Besides that, Jin Seol-woon taught me various things since I was going on a talk show for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Which point of the screen camera to look at for natural eye contact in the video. How to leisurely buy time when answering the host’s questions. When the question topic wasn’t about you, in other words when you’re out of focus, what angle to use for side activities so you look good even when occasionally caught on camera. And so on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Practical tips from a current idol poured out. The virtue of successors is fighting, not variety shows. Isn’t this too much? Jin Seol-woon’s occupational disease was unavoidable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But I feel like Gang-hyeon-ssi would instinctively do well even without experience. I get that feeling.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What are you talking about?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That reporter interview. Gang-hyeon-ssi got a lot of criticism but did you know your face went around as memes like crazy? By the way, this is ongoing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His expression was calm but only his eyes sparkled. He seemed to enjoy bringing this up to me. Is he teasing me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I don’t know about that stuff.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I guess it’s going around as gag memes. I don’t intend to monitor internet public opinion enough to look up such things, so I quickly passed it by.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The exact time for the broadcast start was almost upon us. But the camera had already been rolling from 10 minutes ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like they wanted to include scenes of the successors waiting freely. I figured as much and rested with my feet up on the footrest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The time when successors were conscious of cameras passed ages ago. We’re under CCTV surveillance even going to and from training grounds.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, our leader who hates talk shows came in last, at a precarious time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Woo Sae-geon!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The large screen suddenly lit up brightly. Beyond the screen, a talk show host had appeared. He seemed used to Woo Sae-geon’s uncooperative attitude, making a fuss within reasonable limits.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I thought you weren’t coming!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wanted to do that.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Glad you came!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon naturally plopped down in the very last seat among the panels. Jin Seol-woon approached with makeup tools just in case, but Woo Sae-geon brushed him away with his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Certainly, Woo Sae-geon would be the only person who wouldn’t cause controversy for swatting away Esi with the back of his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Successor Gang-hyeon! Nice to meet you. I’m Bae Eun-soo, hosting the show.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was blankly watching when suddenly the host’s handsome face looked at me. What a polite person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, hello.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Bae Eun-soo was a former singer who, in his young thirties, frequently hosted various music variety shows as an MC.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he were someone significant, he would have been covered in the original work, but not knowing him means he’s someone who doesn’t cause any particular problems.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“It’s your first time but don’t be nervous. It’s enough for the successors to show yourselves as you are. Talk portions and entertainment are what the dirty broadcasting bastards take care of, so Successor Gang-hyeon can just be comfortable and leave!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The phrase “as you are” felt strangely heavy, but maybe it’s just me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among the 10 seats divided into two groups of 5 with the center empty, there were no fixed seats. You could just find a seat you wanted before recording.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Should I sit at the very end opposite Woo Sae-geon? Since I have a delinquent image, a corner spot would be better.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo had already claimed it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After having the seat I was going to take stolen, where to sit became somewhat ambiguous.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I want a corner spot, it’d be right next to either Woo Sae-geon or Ja Hyeong-woo.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I absolutely hate both options.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But from the third seat onward, it gets too close to the center—why is my seat luck like this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, sit next to Seol-woon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, a playfully giggling voice filled my eardrums.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon was sitting in seat 1, directly to the left of the empty center. Sa Ye-ho designated a seat for me, then placed his belongings on the seat next to Woo Sae-geon. Woo Sae-geon opened his eyes to look, then closed them again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I sat down since he told me to, but I was curious about the reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won’t it hurt Jin Seol-woon’s image if I’m next to him? Or will I get cursed at by Esi fans?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why am I sitting here?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, your face can handle being next to Seol-woon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, giggling, approached from behind the chair and wrapped his arms around my shoulders as if pouncing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Given that cameras were rolling and filming us even before recording started, and that Sa Ye-ho knew this while still doing skinship as usual, I didn’t shake him off and grabbed Sa Ye-ho’s arm draped over my shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Snake Successor, former internet broadcast streamer. Sa Ye-ho’s talent lies in his ability to liven up talk shows like this almost as much as the host.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So here, everyone should follow Sa Ye-ho.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon was already leaning back against his chair with his eyes closed, as if this nonsense had nothing to do with him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wouldn’t be surprising if he just meditated throughout the entire recording. There had actually been broadcast episodes where he did exactly that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I was looking to the side wondering what pattern hanbok Sa Ye-ho was wearing today, I made eye contact with Ja Hyeong-woo who was staring from afar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What are you looking at? I quickly averted my gaze.
 </span>
</p>
