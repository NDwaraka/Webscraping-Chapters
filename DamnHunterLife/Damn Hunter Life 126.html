  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 126
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A face I’d never seen on Ma Cheon-ah before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Completely pale with shock, as if she couldn’t believe this was reality, she ran toward me at full speed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under the bright red fireball, I watched Ma Cheon-ah calmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah will gradually become more reliable. She’ll become a good dealer. One who follows the leader’s orders faithfully while sometimes boldly stepping forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the future, she and Won Ha-ri will become the most powerful dealers in the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t read the original work to the end so I never saw the scene where that actually happened, but I clearly remember seeing hints of it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Ma Cheon-ah changes, Ja Hyeong-woo, who will become the next leader, will also get praise from people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud—!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sobok and all my skin turned red in the firelight, and immediately after, a heavy sound crashed over me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I wasn’t mistaken, at this moment a shocking silence spread through the area where people couldn’t even breathe properly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was probably because of me. As soon as the heat of the fireball subsided, I quickly squeezed out to the side in perfect condition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m fine~. I blocked it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Didn’t I boast loudly to Ja Hyeong-woo too? That I wouldn’t get hurt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The meteor-like fireball that had been falling toward me was blocked by a large, fierce animal in front of me instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon’s ox familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ox familiar has the same earth attribute as me. I was a bit scared, but thinking there was nothing I couldn’t try, I’d been attempting contact since earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I succeeded in controlling it. Faster than even Woo Sae-geon, I blocked the imugi attacking me with the ox familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Very good. I use the familiar, and the physical shock from the familiar blocking gets billed to Woo Sae-geon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And it’s more docile than I thought? I was worried it might go berserk from wrong approach attempts, but when I called it, it surprisingly came running right over. No rejection reaction either, just as obedient as the dragon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The two healers who had been rushing toward me in panic, Ja Hyeong-woo and Hae Mi-jun, both stopped halfway. Hae Mi-jun sighed in relief and patted his chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Phew, you startled me… I’m glad you’re safe.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if that’s fine for Hae Mi-jun, I did warn Ja Hyeong-woo earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo’s eyes had suddenly grown huge and he was about to rush at me, but seeing I was unharmed, he shook his head with a deflated expression. Woo Sae-geon glared at me before going back to cutting the imugi with his sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I had a separate reason for doing this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah walked toward where I was with her head hung low, her footsteps heavy. I was a bit scared, but I stood there with a confident attitude.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She grabbed me by the collar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah was a bit taller than me. I was yanked upward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …She looked like she wanted to slap me, but she had enough reason not to. I was prepared for any kind of cursing, but Ma Cheon-ah just glared fiercely at my face without saying anything. Even when she slowly let go of my collar and turned around with her greatsword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She seemed quite shocked. Success.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Still, this is better than you getting hurt. Now have some sense of caution.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After that, Ma Cheon-ah fought steadily without leaving the eastern side. With Ma Cheon-ah staying in position, the battle situation became noticeably more stable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I felt relieved, I was also somewhat concerned…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because she looked like a child who had just finished crying.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ll have to joke around later to cheer her up. Really, kids are hard to manage.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Having finished what I needed to do, now I just needed the strategy to conclude safely. I turned my gaze to the crazy cow, Woo Sae-geon, who was steadily building up contribution points even at this moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though briefly disrupted because of me, he was back to using Ja Hyeong-woo as his dedicated healer while fiercely beating down the imugi.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Exploiting the Twelve Zodiac’s best healer with predictive healing, and squeezing himself—called the god of war—to the limit, the monsters whose patterns had already been figured out were dying left and right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He brought even the boss monster without delay.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon charging in without caring about his own body was terrifying. The reason such things were possible wasn’t particularly because he trusted Ja Hyeong-woo so much, but just because that human was a monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How can a person throw away the basic survival instinct that should exist? It’s not like there’s a foundation of trust or faith.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While occasionally shouting instructions to Ma Cheon-ah and Yang Pyo, Woo Sae-geon steadily drove the large imugi.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was providing moderate support with my bow when I suddenly opened my eyes wide seeing Woo Sae-geon charging toward the boss center.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The form of blue light flowing from Ja Hyeong-woo’s staff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fire energy flowing from the boss monster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My mouth automatically created a loud shout as I looked back and forth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Leader! Ja Hyeong-woo’s heal amount isn’t enough!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The blue heal skill was cast on Woo Sae-geon’s side first, and the boss monster’s attack covered that predicted spot.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Too late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His side was ripped open. The stone fragments that flew when the imugi struck the ground even had fire attached. Small blood splattered, and soon after, flesh sizzled and bubbled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even so, Woo Sae-geon’s sword didn’t stop. He struck down the imugi’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thwack—!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Boss elimination successful. The stage was cleared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wrinkled around his eyes and ran to Woo Sae-geon. Woo Sae-geon immediately threw his sword into inventory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He covered his exposed lower back where his clothes had torn with his sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t even show the wound to Ja Hyeong-woo. Without treating the injury, he ordered return with an indifferent face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My dumbfounded gaze briefly crossed with Woo Sae-geon’s. Woo Sae-geon looked away from me as if it was nothing, or pretending it was nothing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The injury wasn’t the problem. On Woo Sae-geon’s side… there was a snake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a large snake tattoo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Hae Mi-jun grabbed my sleeve tightly beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon hyung. …Did you see?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun had also been providing ranged support from a distance like me, so he could see Woo Sae-geon properly just now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun seemed to have unconsciously let the question slip out because he was so flustered. I subtly gestured for him to keep quiet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Woo Sae-geon had been moving so quickly at that moment and covered it right after it ended, there was a possibility it wasn’t caught on the stage video. We couldn’t show strange reactions when we didn’t even know if it would be revealed or not yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprisingly, Woo Sae-geon’s tattoo wasn’t caught in the stage video. We were incredibly lucky. The outside people don’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for us successors who saw it directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On a nice afternoon, all the Twelve Zodiac except Woo Sae-geon gathered in the earth attribute training ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘When did these kids develop such good teamwork? I knew it since the summer filming, but I’m moved all over again.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, it was also because of the nature of the issue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Especially the young ones gathered around me in a huddle. They were dying of curiosity about Woo Sae-geon, but he hadn’t mentioned it and they were too scared to ask directly, so they were trembling here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is our leader a gangster…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t give them any answer to that. Even I was seriously troubled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can’t confidently say that’s impossible.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His face is dirty, his temper is even worse, he’s mastered intimidating people, and he’s naturally good at combat like he’s been fighting somewhere, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘In the original work up to the part I read, there were exactly three characters whose past wasn’t revealed. Ja Hyeong-woo. Me. And Woo Sae-geon.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, I accidentally made eye contact with Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though we were talking about Woo Sae-geon, he seemed strangely quiet and shrunk down, and Sa Ye-ho’s manner of avoiding my eyes was suspicious. His lip movements were also strangely twitchy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, I had an intuition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You… you bastard. You already knew, didn’t you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grabbed Sa Ye-ho by the collar first. I brought my face close so he couldn’t avoid my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you know by yourself? Open your mouth and spill it right now. Before I rip your mouth apart.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eek, Gang-hyeon is scary…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut up. What’s Woo Sae-geon’s tattoo about?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I threatened him with genuine menace, Sa Ye-ho’s pupils shook as if he was scared. Even though my strength is pathetic enough that I can’t even properly grab and dangle someone by the collar, his appearance with both arms hanging down was quite helpless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung didn’t tell me! I just saw it myself!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Same difference!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kids also followed behind me in a line. Questions rained down like arrows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He wouldn’t get a snake tattoo as a hobby. I’ve only seen that in comics!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is he really a gangster?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are there other tattoos too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho rolled his eyes around, went “Ugh…” and stretched his lips unattractively before finally giving in and shouting. Loud enough to make the room ring.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He was a tattooist!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence flowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eh…? Yang Pyo’s dumbfounded voice was funny, but everyone just kept their mouths shut—if anyone had opened their mouth, they would have made a similar sound. It was that absurd.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The first to object was, surprisingly, Yang Pyo who had become quite clever in recent months.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not a lie, is it? If he’s a tattooist, the tattoos should be in visible places. Like all over his arms and fingers, and on his neck too…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo pointed at his own neck and arms while making his principled statement. Sa Ye-ho confessed more as if giving up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They’re there. Just like you said, all over his neck and arms and fingers.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? They’re not there though? Where?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They’re there but he hid them. You know that appearance transformation skill that bastard Ja Hyeong-woo has? Sae-geon hyung also uses that so…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Form Sculpting (Earth Attribute)&gt;.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to Sa Ye-ho’s explanation, this skill of Woo Sae-geon’s was on-off type, had no time limit, and unlike Ja Hyeong-woo’s, didn’t have the disadvantage of turning off when losing consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, since it consumed stamina according to the applied range, he only used it on visible parts. Then his clothes tore and that incident happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho confessing everything was sincere. Yes, it must be the truth…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘A gangster would be more believable.’
 </span>
</p>
