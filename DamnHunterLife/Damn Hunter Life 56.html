  “Puppy, when we enter the stage this time, you can make a cool entrance, right? Am I looking good? Let’s turn things around once.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  One night, when Gang-hyeon felt he had roughly gotten the hang of earth-attribute attacks. Gang-hyeon whispered to his familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since it was a young, innocent child who liked its master, he thought it would hop around in joy if told to be active together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But what came back was a dejected yet resolute voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I shouldn’t come out into the world.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The familiar, in its childish tone, pointed out something the master hadn’t thought of with surprising maturity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I want to fight coolly too and protect Hyeon. But I can’t. If I get big, Hyeon will hurt.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though the dog familiar had been like that, it couldn’t help but answer its master’s call. It burst out with brave teeth gleaming and faced the boss monster. With a headbutt using all its strength, it separated itself from its master and bit the tail hard, leaving large tooth marks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was similar in size to the ox familiar, or slightly larger. Though smaller than the boss monster in front of it, its upright standing posture looked quite dignified as a tanker’s familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should I say it didn’t resemble its master? A dog with a proudly broad chest growled. Brown fur fluttered from its half-spiritual body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon and Myo Cho-hui, and Jin Seol-woon who was a bit farther away, were all looking this way with clearly surprised faces even from a distance. The familiar’s surprise attack succeeded brilliantly, pushing the boss monster back toward them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it would have been fine to let them continue fighting together, Gang-hyeon called the dog back again. The large dog’s form disappeared in an instant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon gestured to Myo Cho-hui, giving instructions. The situation returned to square one. Since the dog familiar that had been drawing attention in front of the boss monster disappeared, the boss’s target could be any of them. Among them, it was the leader’s mission to exclude the relatively weak dealer and healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jin Seol-woon, come here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yes.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had been looking at Gang-hyeon, withdrew his gaze and followed Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo looked back several times at the sight of Gang-hyeon shooting with his slender arms. The pure white hem of his clothes was so eye-catching that his gaze couldn’t help but be captured.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The clothes were just an excuse. In truth, the clothes didn’t matter at all. Even if Gang-hyeon had been wearing black clothes, it wouldn’t have been much different.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t help but fall for him. No matter how much he tried to hate him, he fell for him again every moment. He looked radiant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It didn’t matter if he himself had no light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He might not have realized that his hands throwing heal skills to the dealers were tinged with old emotions that would be troublesome to reveal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When we became successors together. I hoped to fight together with you like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I waited for days like today, where I protect you and you protect me too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To say a dream came true by taking a long detour…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You’ll soon reject my embrace and run away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo blinked vacantly. His pathetic mind that had been groping through the past finally returned to reality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until then, Gang-hyeon, who had been pinned down, pushed Ja Hyeong-woo’s arm off from above him. Without giving him a single glance, he jumped up and straightened his clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo belatedly realized he had been making a foolish expression. He also mimicked the cold nod and got up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As they watched the tanker and dealer fighting the boss monster, Gang-hyeon’s white back, which had been moving several steps away from Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly stopped still.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He covered his face with his hands in panic, then came stomping back to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why is he coming back? The fool who had momentarily gotten excited over the scene of them getting closer without being able to tell heaven from earth was slow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was because he realized slightly late that Gang-hyeon had a nosebleed gushing from his nose and was urgently blocking it with his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps because it would be troublesome to be caught by others, Gang-hyeon approached as if embracing Ja Hyeong-woo and bumped into him. Ja Hyeong-woo’s hands came out to meet him in confusion. He used the remaining low-grade healing skill.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bleeding stopped immediately, but the problem was the blood stains that remained abundantly down to his chin. There couldn’t be water to wash with inside the gate, and there wasn’t time for that anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …And this scene was also being recorded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That skill of yours. Quickly use the one that covers faces.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it was likely already caught on video… at least the other team members over there shouldn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon looked frantic. When it seemed like Jin Seol-woon was looking back, he got anxious and even wiped his face roughly on Ja Hyeong-woo’s black durumagi.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo placed his palm in front of the small face. Deep navy light rose from his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No one would know about the nosebleed with this. Gang-hyeon, seeming to think it was enough now, quickly distanced himself from Ja Hyeong-woo. Then he approached the others with confident steps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just then, Woo Sae-geon and Myo Cho-hui’s weapons simultaneously pierced through the boss monster’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it over?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [STAGE 30 has been conquered.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s over.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon walked leisurely toward the people standing around the boss monster. Jin Seol-woon was closest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon’s expression became subtle when he saw Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He passed by without knowing. Next was Woo Sae-geon, who stared at Gang-hyeon expressionlessly for a long time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I don’t know how to use you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was around the time Gang-hyeon felt something was strange. Jin Seol-woon tapped his shoulder from behind. When he turned around, Jin Seol-woon immediately placed a handkerchief under his nose and had him press his nose bridge with thumb and index finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Has the bleeding stopped?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lastly, Myo Cho-hui, who discovered Gang-hyeon’s face, let out a small “Ah!” scream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay? You had a nosebleed!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Gang-hyeon realize. Ja Hyeong-woo, who was at the place he looked back at, pretended ignorance with an indifferent expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he should be happy about succeeding in the conquest, Gang-hyeon was furious. But he couldn’t raise his voice in the middle of a recording scene. In the end, he just scrunched up his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That bastard only pretended to use his skill.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They left the stage space and returned to their base, the school. After passing the entrance, they finally reached a space without cameras.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had been walking alongside, whispered softly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry about earlier. For dropping you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His usual languid attitude was nowhere to be found, as he rarely flustered with a reddened face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before either Gang-hyeon or Ja Hyeong-woo could answer, the leader’s voice pressed down on the atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What have I always mentioned?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Rather than asking out of genuine curiosity, it seemed intended to check whether his subordinates properly remembered his words. Judging by the irritation dripping from his tone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Don’t apologize for mistakes that occur in gates or stages.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Train more with the spirit to apologize. It was something Woo Sae-geon had drilled into the Twelve Zodiac like brainwashing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next, the arrow turned to Gang-hyeon. Just when it seemed like things would pass quietly, Gang-hyeon clicked his tongue slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, you explain.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Apologies and explanations are strictly different things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why didn’t you report earlier when you succeeded in manifesting your dog familiar? …Include everything related to other attributes too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon had never urged Gang-hyeon to report on training progress before. He obtained information through Won Ha-ri and others, didn’t expect Gang-hyeon himself to submit reports, and originally didn’t even want to see his face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon lifted his head and deliberately brightened his voice as if pleased.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you acknowledging me as a successor?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought Woo Sae-geon might flinch a little, but Woo Sae-geon was Woo Sae-geon. His back, showing not a hint of confusion, replied.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can regular hunters enter stages?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That meant he would accept Gang-hyeon as his chess piece.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A certain university in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though they hadn’t even adapted to the sudden heat wave, the burden of final exams was placed squarely on the students’ heads.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though it was natural to devote oneself to studying with exams approaching, no one was studying. Was it because the class being held in this spacious lecture hall where Park Ho-jeong sat was a liberal arts elective not closely related to their major?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Watching Stage 30?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No professor included successors in their exam scope, but the male students in the lecture hall were chattering about an irrelevant topic.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Park Ho-jeong, who prided herself on being an ordinary female student, followed the most trendy information in South Korea – stages – down to daily updates. Her friends also contributed to Park Ho-jeong’s knowledge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A classmate who licked Woo Sae-geon frame by frame every second. Another friend who followed Esi as an Innate fan but ended up stanning all successors like idol fans. A friend who went in to see Cho-hui despite hating cruel scenes because Cho-hui was so pretty. A classmate who was a viewer of GO Ye-ho’s broadcasts but came to her senses to find her phone album covered with face-revealed Sa Ye-ho and other successors.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Given her friends’ tendencies, Park Ho-jeong felt somewhat uncomfortable with the male students’ conversation she heard in the noisy lecture hall 10 minutes before class started.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yo, Gang-hyeon is fucking useless. The tanker is tied to Gang-hyeon so he can’t go anywhere.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The expert male students in the corner of the lecture hall viewed the successors like soccer players, consuming them thoroughly as sports.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s stock went up and down repeatedly even within one video.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —His bow aim is decent!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —His body is shit though.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Isn’t his judgment good for a newbie? Compared to when Yang Pyo or Jin Seol-woon first entered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Even so, he’s a weakling who gets carried by the healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then at some point, it tilted heavily toward the side that he couldn’t pull his weight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —If Gang-hyeon had his familiar from the start, he wouldn’t have needed to ride the ox. The car accident was the problem from there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —But his familiar came out later, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —So he was hiding it, wasn’t he?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —How could they hide from Woo Sae-geon? Woo Sae-geon must have told him not to bring it out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Looking at Gang-hyeon’s image, he might be ignoring the leader’s words and moving however he wants.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —The successors’ discipline is fucked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On the other hand, they reevaluated. Even the male students who were endlessly harsh on fellow men had things they could see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —What’s with the nosebleed at the end? Doesn’t that mean he worked hard?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —It’s his first time. He’ll gradually improve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Shouldn’t Gang-hyeon not be conquered? Is there any need to clean up corpses?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —The first time was coughing up blood, and now it’s a nosebleed, so I see this as progress too…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, all successors were on a growth trajectory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And all of them were young and vigorous ages where it was easier to gain or learn something rather than lose it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Twenty-two years old. They were the same age as the students currently in this lecture hall, or one or two years older.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And among these, students who considered themselves fully grown adults were quite rare.
