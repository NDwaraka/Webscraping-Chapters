  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 97
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo sighed through their connected mouths and let saliva flow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as the sleeping Gang-hyeon swallowed it with a gulping sound, he clung back and sucked and devoured the lips as if they were his own. Transparent silver threads hung between the two lower lips that kept attaching and separating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The hot breath he was breathing into him. Without that, Gang-hyeon couldn’t breathe any cold air beneath him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The angle twisted several times and repeatedly interlocked again. This was because Ja Hyeong-woo was rubbing his lips roughly as if he’d lost his mind, and his tongue was going in and out irregularly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s cheek, unable to withstand that shaking, was about to fall. Ja Hyeong-woo put his hand between Gang-hyeon’s cheek and the sheet to support it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Skin so transparent that blood vessels showed through. Excessively delicate, thin enough to crumble at his fingertips, and warm. Even though it made no sense to taste with his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was disgusted with himself for becoming accustomed to such acts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To think he was such a person lacking in self-control. If it had been just the first time or two, it would be one thing, but now he couldn’t deny that he was pursuing pleasure. The self-hatred that had accumulated like snow seemed to pierce his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since giving yang energy before Stages would prevent Gang-hyeon from suffering pain, he had kissed for a long time right before Stage 36 too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo pressed his forehead against Gang-hyeon’s forehead with eyes blackened by self-reproach. After staring for a while, he soon dove back into the parted lips. He poured warmth and that much desire into the cool-temperature body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With one last bit of conscience.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since that time when he had been angry at Gang-hyeon, he had never again taken his thing out to masturbate during Gang-hyeon’s treatment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as he was stroking Gang-hyeon’s already reddened and swollen lips with his thumb glowing blue, trouble broke out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon limply raised his arm as if talking in his sleep and pushed Ja Hyeong-woo away. Since he was asleep, there was no strength in it at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo staggered back from even that weak force and startled as he created distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the blood in his body went cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Gang-hyeon… half woke up.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why? Surely the mouse familiar should be preventing such situations beforehand—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next moment, Ja Hyeong-woo heard an unfamiliar ghostly voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Why are you doing it secretly without Hyeon knowing?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t his familiar, the mouse. It had a more childlike way of speaking, but the voice tone itself sounded lower than the mouse familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Hyeon?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo should have realized then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of blankly mulling over the dog familiar’s words, he should have properly assessed the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {You’re deceiving Hyeon! I’m going to wake him up!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An extremely angry voice was the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sleeping Gang-hyeon began to toss and turn a little. But he was immediately blocked by Ja Hyeong-woo’s thighs. Recognizing the trapped state while sleeping, his legs struggled a bit as if trying to escape.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo froze completely. Still with Gang-hyeon’s saliva that he’d sucked from under his tongue around his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Pungsandog! You!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon another voice rang out sharply. It was the mouse familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Are they fighting with the dog familiar?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the mouse familiar had been overseeing the treatment all along, it immediately noticed not only this situation but also its master’s bewilderment. It desperately tried to put Gang-hyeon back to sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Gang-hyeon’s weak struggling didn’t stop. His eyelids trembled. Now it really seemed like he would wake up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I’ve been deceiving him well all this time… but the Pungsandog found out. I’m being overpowered. Unlike me, it’s the original master, so that side has to be stronger!}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo controlled his legs that flinched wanting to run away for a moment. Because there was something more important.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you… no, are you guys fighting over Gang-hyeon’s body right now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He couldn’t even guess what was happening inside this frail body. Ja Hyeong-woo pressed with a troubled expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s better if he wakes up. Rather than Gang-hyeon getting hurt from this!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A loud voice rang through the room once, and even the faint echo subsided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But surprisingly, Gang-hyeon didn’t wake up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the signs of trying to wake up disappeared. The tossing and turning stopped and became quiet. Ja Hyeong-woo was even more rigid than before and only moved his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What happened?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I won.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar answered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {When the master shouted to rather wake him up, that guy softened at those words and lowered his tail on his own. How strange.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Saying it would talk separately with the dog familiar, the mouse familiar tried to adjust Gang-hyeon’s sleep state again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, since things had already been greatly disturbed by the series of events, he could feel the mouse familiar was having difficulties.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘There isn’t much time left.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From experience, the yang energy wasn’t full yet. A little more was needed. Because an important matter was coming up in just two days.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after experiencing such a cooling event, Ja Hyeong-woo found it absurd how his heart and lower body immediately responded when he tried to kiss again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under the precarious condition that Gang-hyeon had fallen into light sleep, he moved his tongue even more carefully and tapped the mucous membrane.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sleeping Gang-hyeon’s lips nibbled at Ja Hyeong-woo’s like a baby.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A clearer moan than before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmh… hh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon was feeling pleasure from Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sweet nasal sounds mixed into the sounds coming from his throat. Ja Hyeong-woo looked down at him as if he’d been hit, then discovered that the center covered by white cloth had bulged up and stiffened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So right now, he was watching Gang-hyeon get an erection in real time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Should this case be called a wet dream?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon still had some youthful traces left on his face. Standing together, people would see Ja Hyeong-woo as a hyung who was several years older.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That innocent face was now flushed with sexual pleasure, breathing pitiful breaths. Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t believe the appetizing scene before his eyes. While feeling terrible immorality, indescribable excitement made the back of his neck and lower abdomen bubble and boil.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While curious about whose dream Gang-hyeon would have if he was dreaming at this moment, the thought that he absolutely didn’t want to know blocked his throat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the beginning was definitely himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Responsibility and guilt were pushed aside. Deep elation made blood vessels stand out all over Ja Hyeong-woo’s body. His whole body tingled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His own cock had already passed the stage where it could be managed. Inside his pants, it moved bulgingly on its own and wetted the center with precum as if he’d leaked. The situation was too arousing, there was nothing he could do.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even so, Ja Hyeong-woo paid no attention to his own aching lower body and focused only on the white front that was protruding before his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I want to see it.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was desperate to confirm Gang-hyeon’s erect cock with his own eyes. The scene thrust before his eyes was too great a temptation. He was on the verge of losing his mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He removed the pants and underwear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Who would have known it would be pink all the way here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pale, straight cock was red and ripe at the tip. Even the pubic hair was thin and sparse. Below that, two round testicles were exposed without hiding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something that was merely another man’s cock, Ja Hyeong-woo stared at intently as if he would carve it clearly into his memory. The slightly erect flesh pillar was slick with precum and trembled with pulsing, making it look appetizing. Strength entered Ja Hyeong-woo’s lower abdomen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He felt an unfamiliar impulse. An impulse to lick it with his tongue and put it in his mouth, making him wonder if it was appetite.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because it was Gang-hyeon’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He stopped at imagination when it came to sucking the cock. He touched Gang-hyeon’s solitary cock with his hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon immediately flinched.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His face, drunk with sleep yet heated, was honest and lewdly beautiful. At the visual stimulation, Ja Hyeong-woo’s alter ego reacted violently and twitched as if it would tear through his underwear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo wrapped his palm around not his own, but Gang-hyeon’s cock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if the mouse familiar warned that he would really wake up, the already blind and deaf Ja Hyeong-woo probably wouldn’t have listened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Using himself as a standard, he thought the pretty cock before his eyes was small in size. However, it was also true that it felt quite hefty compared to the thin frame.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he gently caressed it, the color gradually became redder. At the tip of the swollen glans, a small slit gaped and spat water in streams. His palm quickly became soaked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did Gang-hyeon know? That while he slept, someone had stripped his lower body to admire it, masturbated him instead, and that he had even responded by trembling and panting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The speed of shaking the cock increased. Precum spread along Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand and was applied to the shaft, making the cock glide more smoothly through the hole made by his palm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be meaningless to distinguish whose breathing was filling the room with rough sounds.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmm…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He literally came while sleeping. The semen he retched up overflowed from Ja Hyeong-woo’s grip. While what flowed down fell on his pelvis and underwear, Gang-hyeon’s face became pleasantly languid. Ja Hyeong-woo felt wretched instead and reddened his ears to a deep color.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he couldn’t believe it even after witnessing it with his own eyes, Ja Hyeong-woo looked closely at his grip soaked with liquid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Liquid Gang-hyeon had ejaculated. That came from Gang-hyeon’s cock…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had no leisure to savor the sexual sensation that surged up. Hurriedly, Ja Hyeong-woo also took out his own cock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he rapidly rubbed with the same hand, Gang-hyeon’s semen got smeared white between the bumpy blood vessels. Like he wasn’t in his right mind, he got excited by that fact again and moved his shoulders at high speed solely to ejaculate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s cock was also already too late to return to normal, so rather than calming it down, finishing quickly was the answer. In the end, this treatment concluded with him lifting Gang-hyeon’s top to his chest and ejaculating on his stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…The yang energy should be sufficient.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While suppressing too-late self-reproach and wiping Gang-hyeon’s stomach first with a towel, trouble finally broke out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon made a long “mmm…” sound and trembled his eyelids. As if trying to wake up, he brought his arm to his face and pressed it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silently shocked, Ja Hyeong-woo barely managed to return Gang-hyeon’s underwear and pants to their original positions and bolted. He covered him with the blanket as if throwing it. He hid behind the door panting.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t wiped the bottom yet… Ja Hyeong-woo hid holding the towel he’d used to wipe his semen, then squeezed his eyes shut thinking it was over now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right, let’s tell the truth. I can’t hide it anymore.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon, from behind the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Uwaaaah!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A scream burst out in his actual voice. Ja Hyeong-woo squeezed his eyes even tighter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But it was kind of… funny. It was funny, but no laughter came out. It was Ja Hyeong-woo’s greatest predicament of his life.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as Ja Hyeong-woo, who had clenched his mouth shut, was about to step forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ha, shit, should I just die? Ah…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s lamenting voice could be heard. It seemed to be a monologue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, seeing him continue sitting on the bed, he seemed to think it was a wet dream. If it was fortunate, you could call it fortunate…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What if Gang-hyeon really dies from embarrassment?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even in this situation, Ja Hyeong-woo’s head went numb with worry. He was serious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
