 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Every night, while someone might write in their diary, I take out my notebook where I’ve recorded information about the original work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I compare tomorrow’s date with how much the original story has progressed, pondering when and where I should intervene.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although I’ve done various things, the events up to now were all things that shouldn’t have happened at this point in time if I hadn’t moved with advance knowledge of the information.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The original work is still in its very early stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for Ja Hyeong-woo collapsing from sleep deprivation, there hasn’t been any crisis directed at the original protagonist yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The original mentions they’ll conquer up to Stage 33 without any problems. This part is closer to episodes just meant to introduce each of the Twelve Zodiac characters one by one, and several stages were even skipped in the story. Because they’re not very important or serious.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then by my standards, what would be the first serious crisis in the original work where they’d face life-threatening danger…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As I’ve been thinking all along, it would definitely be the ‘Busan Gate.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a serious A-rank gate where regular hunters couldn’t handle it so successors were deployed, and most of the successors suffered severe injuries.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That very episode where even the protagonist Ja Hyeong-woo becomes covered in blood and desperately calls for the mouse familiar he had cast away in his moment of desperation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the current point in time, it’s still far off. I remember the exact date of this incident. June 2nd, Busan Gate opening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But now it’s only April.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So can I take it easy for a while?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the original’s progression speed has become slower than my perceived speed, I might be able to rest for quite a long time. There didn’t seem to be any worrisome crises until the Busan Gate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Stages? Woo Sae-geon will command the kids and handle it himself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because even if the Ox successor’s temperament is questionable, his performance is reliable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Regular gates? The regular hunters will somehow handle those with their numbers.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Who would have thought a high-grade gate not mentioned in the original would appear?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In this leisurely time, the only problem would probably be my pathetic body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why the hell won’t I build muscle even though I eat two bowls of rice and consistently work out? Far from getting stronger, I’m constantly on the verge of life and death because I’m even taking sword classes.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I let out a deep sigh and pulled the blanket up to my neck. This body somehow always feels chilly, so feeling warm made me feel a bit better.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was getting drowsy and about to surrender to 9 hours of sleep today too…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  An alarm sounded at dawn. My phone was vibrating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is it a new stage notification? It’s late too, can’t they have some manners?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened the text content and felt the blood in my entire body turn cold.
 </span>

  The Busan Gate that broke out around 1 AM today could not be conquered, causing severe damage to civilians and regular hunters.

  Currently, emergency alerts have been issued throughout the Busan area, and support requests have been sent to all successors.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …What is this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It got too fast.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only the sound of the second hand could be heard in the quiet room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was enveloped in an unprecedented discomfort since possessing this body. The sound of the second hand was drowned out by my shallow breathing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head was telling me to go on the internet right now and search for the damage scale of the Busan Gate, but my hands wouldn’t move. The phone fell from my hands. When I slowly lowered my gaze, I saw my hands clenching and unclenching palely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I think I’m scared right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of being alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Is it my fault?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I let my guard down thinking the Busan Gate wouldn’t be today at least.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I hadn’t been sleeping and had been watching the news instead, I would have noticed the Busan Gate opening faster than now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Knowing in advance that civilians who got sucked in and regular hunters who followed would all die, I could have somehow incited the successors to prevent the gate from reaching this state beforehand…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No. It’s not.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dwelling on what had already happened wouldn’t help at all. I shook my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My legs kept wobbling as I got out of bed and moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Let me check what I’ve done to save the world and save my own life too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, I provoked the core healer Ja Hyeong-woo to induce him to train intensively.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I helped the second healer Hae Mi-jun to be able to do his part.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I made the all-role support tanker Jin Seol-woon sing again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …The last one doesn’t directly help with the Busan Gate. I’ll have to hope that at least strengthened Jin Seol-woon’s mentality.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should I consider that I’ve already done everything I can?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I snapped to my senses and turned on the internet. In emergency situations like this, internet breaking news is faster than going outside to get information directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, the status window would be fastest, so normally I’d look at the status window. But since I haven’t been invited to the successor chat, looking at the status window in situations like this gives me nothing.

  The monsters already came out of the rift?
 </span>
</p>

  The portal was a cauldron of chaos. I barely managed to pull out the news article I wanted from among it all.

  [Real-time] Korean Successors Enter Busan Gate
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  According to the emergency manual, two successors remain at school as reserves, and all other successors should be absent from school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking at the roster, it was slightly different from what appeared in the original work, but it was within my expectations. The most appropriate combat combination I could think of.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun stepped forward, and instead, unlike the original, the Snake successor remained. The other remaining member was the Sheep successor, same as before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then now, besides believing that Ja Hyeong-woo and the supporting characters from the original will safely handle everything…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Have I really done everything I can in this situation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s one more thing. Something outside my domain, but also not outside it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Awakening as a hunter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking down at the gate-related articles chaotically appearing on the screen, I raise my gaze with quite an uncomfortable feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Actually, if possible, I’d want to live without awakening or anything like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’ve never been the kind of person suited for such responsibility-heavy work.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I wasn’t tempted by the affluent retirement life that would come from becoming an awakened one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For me, there was no other reason why I absolutely had to awaken besides that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Facing my pathetic self wasn’t as easy as I thought. While breathing slowly, I realized I had forgotten something very important.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Squeaky!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar. The thing that was absolutely necessary for Ja Hyeong-woo’s miraculous recovery in the original Busan Gate!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hurriedly called out Squeaky who had been sleeping. Squeaky poked his face out between my simple clothes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You, go to Ja Hyeong-woo.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I hadn’t expected the Busan Gate to come this early, my voice was somewhat unstable as I rushed to match things to the original.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, Squeaky obediently listened to all my urgent explanations. Then he shook his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I understand what you mean. That I might be needed by my master right now.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. But why are you being rational when talking about Ja Hyeong-woo for once?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When it’s Ja Hyeong-woo that you’re crazy about, and he might be in some kind of crisis right now…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Do you not know what the act of making a pact means?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I blinked blankly, a blue 子 (mouse) character slowly appeared on the back of my hand. The mark that Squeaky had engraved when we first made our contract, the trace of Squeaky entrusting himself to my body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {The covenant between god and believer is powerful. I can never leave you. Unless you break the conditions first.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Is it right to compare you to a god? If you’re a god, then I’m the strongest of the Twelve Zodiac.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see the mouse familiar’s mood souring, but since that was my intention, I ignored it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I had just realized I was truly screwed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “So now I have to go with you to Ja Hyeong-woo and tell him you’re a good familiar?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I self-deprecatingly ran my hands through my hair. My teeth ground together automatically from the surge of irritation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The plan had completely gone awry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunter School students cannot leave the school grounds unless it’s through gate teleportation. That’s the rule.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’m not awakened, so how can I meet the gate transportation conditions?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to personally take Squeaky to Ja Hyeong-woo, but I can’t.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Damn.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I grabbed the unhelpful Squeaky and stuffed him inside my simple clothes. Chewing my lips, I turned my head sharply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘How do I check the situation of the successors inside the gate right now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stages and regular gates are different. The regular gate they’re in now isn’t broadcast. Stages are recorded by the gate system and transmitted to broadcasting stations, but regular gates don’t have such a system.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, there’s no way to know from the outside what’s happening inside regular gates, whether things are going well or not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, there’s exactly one way.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Successor communication through the status window…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But as I remind myself again, I don’t have successor communication functions. The only method is to spy on other successors currently remaining at school.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Currently remaining at school…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought of two people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I didn’t spend even a few seconds choosing between them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Running across the campus under the night sky, I snuck into the Snake successor’s house with my stealth skill activated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Desperately suppressing my panting breath, I searched for the homeowner. He was on a hammock not far away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah… fuck.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His reddish-brown hair in a tassel cut swayed roughly. Sa Ye-ho’s face only doesn’t show his sharpness when he’s truly pissed off, which was exactly now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t I go?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho is talking while looking at empty air. It’s status window communication. The other party is definitely one of the successors who went out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Sa Ye-ho is receiving updates on the situation of the successors in combat, I just need to hide nearby and pick up Sa Ye-ho’s words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung, fucking never overdo it. If it doesn’t seem to work, just retreat.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is the person on the phone Woo Sae-geon?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, don’t hang up on me! Don’t hang up! If hyung hangs up, fuck, what am I supposed to do with my anxiety? If you don’t have time to talk, just keep the connection! Let me know that hyung isn’t dead!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been frantically raging, fell off the hammock with a thud. But he didn’t even get up and the veins in his neck bulged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Listening to Sa Ye-ho’s cracking voice, I clearly see a scene as if I witnessed it directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s recruitment and Jin Seol-woon’s mental strengthening were all useless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The flow is proceeding similarly to the original.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A life-threatening crisis that threatens the survival of the entire Twelve Zodiac approaches.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo will end up standing alone, covered in blood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Sa Ye-ho suddenly shouted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Startled. I thought he could see me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was still shouting at the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That bastard is also a successor. Let that bastard stay instead of me. Let me go out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though he’s always slippery, the Snake successor is someone who acts when he needs to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He keeps repeating his wishful thinking about going out himself to join the battle even if belatedly, but even he probably knows it’s just whining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hunter School gate rules. Under any circumstances, 2 successors are designated as reserves, and all successors cannot leave Hunter School.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There’s no way for Sa Ye-ho to be freed from this regulation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Successors in non-awakened states aren’t counted as successors in emergencies, so Sa Ye-ho is inevitably tied to the reserve team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were just school rules, he would have broken them hundreds of times already, but this was a rule established by the gate. One of the principles that absolutely oppresses humans.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that way, countless people have shed tears.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My hands and feet were terribly cold. It felt like all the blood in my body had stopped. But my heart was beating loudly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While holding my breath, I steadied my breathing while reviewing the situation I was placed in during this short time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A message from the status window caught my eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  I blankly repeated that word.
 </span>
</p>

  “Hyung, Sae-geon hyung. Are you hurt? You’re okay, right? What about the other kids?”

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho remained glued to the communication with a wrecked expression, not even knowing someone had come and gone beside him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, something changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Suddenly moved. Before Sa Ye-ho’s eyes.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Uh, Sa Ye-ho, who had been too surprised to do anything but gape, suddenly shot up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wait, I don’t know what it is but someone appeared, can I go there—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, before Sa Ye-ho could finish organizing his words, the number changed again.

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then Sa Ye-ho’s scream, who had been dazed for a moment, rang out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fuck! What the hell is this! Who else is going out besides me!”
