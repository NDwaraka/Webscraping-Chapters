 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lunch was safely finished, but danger still lurked. The day was too long.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, I have another space besides home that I consider safe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I just need to stay in the office. Sa Ye-ho is there. He’ll protect me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I was mistaken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That bastard pushed his way in regardless of who was there.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why is Sa Ye-ho taking a nap at this exact moment?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was sprawled out like dried radish greens on the office sofa after lunch, and cunning Ja Hyeong-woo targeted this moment. Not even sitting down, just standing ominously in the doorway—he looked exactly like a stalker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Chasing away random merchants is Sa Ye-ho’s job!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dereliction of duty by the snake he keeps is also a problem, but before yelling at Ja Hyeong-woo, I rubbed my face first. I seriously suspect I’ve developed a blushing condition lately.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Get out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You were training earlier. I came to check if your body’s okay. You used strength handling your familiar, so you need treatment too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho woke up at the loud voice. He opened his eyes drowsily like someone who’d been wronged while sleeping, and seemed to have heard the word ‘treatment’ too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I found it hard to look at Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes, so I focused on about his chest level.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t make excuses. Get out!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sa Ye-ho is here too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s here because he helps with work! You can’t because you’re stupid!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After shouting, I realized it was too much of a personal attack. I flinched first at my own words.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Until recently, I used to say such things thoughtlessly without any problem…… Why am I suddenly bothered by it?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes drooped. At that moment, an unknown sensation suspiciously popped up from inside my ribcage, but I tried hard to ignore that feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that bastard says something else.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is it very burdensome?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? ……Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo himself was the one who said to speak honestly about everything. I responded with even more emphasis.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But now you know too. That I—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Shut up!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem is discussing this where Sa Ye-ho can hear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho has a face like ‘what the hell is this mess?’ Since Ja Hyeong-woo won’t listen to reason, I glared at Sa Ye-ho. Silent communication passed between us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Don’t ask what the situation is. If you bring it up, I’ll die.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ohhh~.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Saying I’ll die works much better on the kids than saying I’ll kill them. Probably because the latter has far superior probability.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ye-ho. Chase this thing away.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Am I a guard snake?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grumbled as he got up and stretched. He pushed Ja Hyeong-woo at the doorway with his foot. He tried pushing that statue-like bastard with his hands, poking him with his back, making various efforts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon he dusted off his hands and shrugged his shoulders.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He won’t budge.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re a dealer losing to a healer in strength?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Our leader loses to healers too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the upstream is clear, the downstream is clear too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A small smile spread across Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips as he followed me with his eyes while I was speechless.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems like if I don’t properly deal with him once, he’ll keep following me around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why did I think Ja Hyeong-woo had grown internally? He just looks calm and neat to others, but he’s still stuck being that same Hyeong-woo from back then.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When they were young, Cheon Gang-hyeon didn’t know any better and played well together as Hyeong-woo followed him around, and apparently took care of him thinking he was pitiful inside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But I’m different from that Cheon Gang-hyeon, and Hyeong-woo has grown up now too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Go train. Are you really crazy? Slacking off? Get lost while I’m being nice. ……We’ll talk separately this evening.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If that bastard comes at me like that, I need to have a showdown too. Just wait until we’re alone—I’ll shake him down completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As promised, I called Ja Hyeong-woo to my house in the evening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s that in your hands?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo set down various rice cakes of unknown origin and bottles of sikhye on my dining table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “For you to keep and eat. Do you want to drink the sikhye now? I put it in the fridge so it’s cold.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When did I ask you to bring stuff like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I wanted you to eat more of something. You liked it when you were young.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who even remembered whether Gang-hyeon ate egg yolks cooked or not.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sikhye and sweet rice cakes are things I do happen to completely devour when they appear at meals on rare occasions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s probably just a coincidence, and Ja Hyeong-woo brought them based on old Cheon Gang-hyeon’s tastes, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Take them back!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you eat them here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The damn bastard ignored the homeowner and filled a cup with sikhye. Without realizing it, my eyes glanced toward the dining table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sikhye with thin ice looked cold just from seeing it. The cool, sweet taste swirled in my mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Steamed rice cake and wind cake. I happen to prefer rice cakes with red beans the most too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s because I’m pissed. Because I’m pissed. My throat is parched!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, I scrunched up my face and sat across from him at the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quickly cut rice cake into bite-sized pieces in front of me. He smiled silently.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow I felt strange. I also felt like my stomach was churning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With a face that showed not a single grain of ulterior motive, making an expression like he’d be full if even one bite of food entered my mouth……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, there’s something I need to say before eating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shouldn’t let Ja Hyeong-woo act up anymore.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. I kissed you yesterday. Happy now?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shot it out first with the feeling of pulling a grenade pin and setting it down. There’s no point dragging it out since it’ll only disturb my peace of mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But why is your face turning red? No, not my face—why is Ja Hyeong-woo’s face turning red too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What else did we do besides that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Are you trying to mess around now?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You want me to stammer and not be able to speak. Let’s see if I do that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You jerked me off too. Happy?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I deliberately chose a crude word hoping Ja Hyeong-woo would realize his own shamelessness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But while Ja Hyeong-woo was flustered, he didn’t show signs of embarrassment. Heat faintly rippled behind the pupils looking at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I really don’t understand Ja Hyeong-woo anymore. He doesn’t seem like the guy I knew. Or maybe he was always like this and hid it well until now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But well. That was treatment.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My conscience pricked, but I finished speaking while pretending to be nonchalant. Objectively, it was treatment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whatever emotions I or Ja Hyeong-woo had during the process.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……How about we do treatment today too?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s when I came to my senses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had fallen for my own scheme.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately, with the dining table between us, I wasn’t under mortal threat. I thought that topic was finished earlier. Damn it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Having enough won’t hurt. Rather, it’s been a bit insufficient until now. Haven’t you felt unwell sometimes during this period?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Whether I was sick before or whatever, as Ja Hyeong-woo’s words were thrown out one by one, the atmosphere became uncontrollably serious. Suddenly my breathing sounded too loud. My heart was pounding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was swallowing dry saliva when suddenly Ja Hyeong-woo hung his head low. The strange sensation subsided.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Sorry. I couldn’t do it more often……, but I should have told you everything and increased the frequency.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But wait, listening to this, just how—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How many times did you do it secretly?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even with those mountain-like shoulders, I felt like Ja Hyeong-woo had just shrunk.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can’t you count? Can’t you answer?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I pressed him angrily. After hesitating, Ja Hyeong-woo opened his mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “About once per stage. And before the friendly match, when I went for gate support.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s over ten times by rough estimate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The feeling of being dealt a finishing blow is quite pleasant. My mood has been gloomy until now, but it’s still not completely over. Knowing the frequency isn’t everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you just kiss?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unable to answer, Ja Hyeong-woo struggled with his whole body. Cold sweat formed on his temples.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My blood pressure kept rising so I downed the sikhye in one shot. Was this sikhye a coolant Ja Hyeong-woo brought so I wouldn’t die from burst blood vessels?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won’t you speak properly?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you deliberately got hurt and I was angry, I masturbated on your thigh once.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My insides are boiling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “More.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “When you were sleeping lightly and your cock reacted…… I couldn’t hold back and touched your lower area.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I retire and go to prison, it’ll be for assaulting Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I held my throbbing forehead and crossed my legs. Meanwhile, Ja Hyeong-woo looked worried I might collapse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re saying I didn’t wake up during that bullshit?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The mouse familiar helped.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My eyes squeezed shut from deep betrayal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Squeaky, that bastard. In the end, he went around his owner’s back?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You better know you saved your life by going back to Ja Hyeong-woo. Otherwise you’d have died by my hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You did such trashy things and expected me to forgive you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the fact that I fell for this bastard’s kiss yesterday was humiliating.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s face hardened and became quiet as if he’d swallowed a ball of fire.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Silence continued as he blamed himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I finished drinking the sikhye and spooned up rice grains. During this time, Ja Hyeong-woo kept his head hanging low.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why aren’t you making excuses? When did you have such thick skin about treatment or whatever?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sikhye tasted better than expected, so I pulled the bottle over and refilled my cup. Even though that sound was clearly audible, Ja Hyeong-woo remained silent.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why didn’t you say anything earlier?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……I thought you couldn’t accept it. Sorry. I didn’t want to be hated by you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I probably do seem that inflexible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now I’m in a state of resignation thinking I’ve already ruined the original story, but back then I was in full vigor and might have done anything to shake off Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that’s that and this is this. In the end, I’m the victim, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is hiding things some pretty behavior? That’s what pisses me off the most. As expected, you’re a rat bastard crazy bastard. I don’t regret cursing you out one bit.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……I’m not hurt anymore either. I’m someone who deserves to be treated that way.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This seems like his self-esteem has hit rock bottom, which makes me uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were someone else in front of me, I’d suspect they were deliberately trying to provoke sympathy……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But the opponent is Ja Hyeong-woo. I know all too well that Ja Hyeong-woo’s guilt is thick enough to gnaw at his entire mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not because of the original story, but because of the Ja Hyeong-woo I’ve personally observed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And judging from the way Ja Hyeong-woo looked at me last night……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You honestly enjoyed it, didn’t you? That’s why you didn’t say anything quickly, right? Is that your preference?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I made him flustered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His dark face noticeably reddened. Tendons bulged slightly in Ja Hyeong-woo’s forearms as he bit his thin lips. He must have clenched his fists tight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I should be disgusted, my mind should be destroyed, but maybe because the sikhye tastes good, my mind is surprisingly healthy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Ja Hyeong-woo raised his head and looked into my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You smiled for the first time today.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Me?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I treat you?”
 </span>
</p>
