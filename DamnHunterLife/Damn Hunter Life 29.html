  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 29
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did you come?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s a secret order from Leader Woo Sae-geon. He told me to go observe how the new trainees are doing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do you usually tell the observation targets directly?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri was looking back and forth between me and Jin Seol-woon from a distance. My heart sank a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This would be troublesome for Jin Seol-woon’s image. Let’s chase him away.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stopped fanning myself and waved my hand dismissively toward Jin Seol-woon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then just say there was one model student and one delinquent. Go quickly.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Which one is the delinquent?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The guy right in front of you. The one who only wears simple clothes and is all sweaty right now.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as Won Ha-ri heard the word delinquent, she focused her eyes and stared intently at me. But when I readily said the delinquent was me, she seemed somehow deflated and looked away again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And suddenly remembering Jin Seol-woon’s attribute, Won Ha-ri picked up the sword she had used in sword class and stood up abruptly. She went around in a circle to Jin Seol-woon’s side, trying not to get close to me at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is Jin Seol-woon-nim’s sword, right? I used it well. Thank you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Watching Won Ha-ri bow politely with a respectful attitude, Jin Seol-woon’s expression became uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s not my sword.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Please return it to Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi. It’s his.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Won Ha-ri realize who owned the weapon she had been gripping tightly for hours.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She was looking for an earth attribute sword, so I let her use it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Learning the truth, Won Ha-ri turned around stiffly. The moment our eyes met, I gave a perfect wink with one eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clang. The sword was thrown to the floor. Won Ha-ri headed straight for the door without looking back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like Jin Seol-woon stared at my wink longer than Won Ha-ri did.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since you’re here, help me up.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I stretched out my right hand while lying down, but Jin Seol-woon gave me both hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both hands came under my armpits. He pulled me up like pulling out a radish and let my feet touch the ground.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just before his hands let go, Jin Seol-woon’s low voice brushed against my ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Eat more food.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy’s showing off just because he’s a bit strong.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not to be outdone, I shouted at Won Ha-ri who was about to disappear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri! Do you know what this sword’s name is? Want to hear it?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…Close that mouth.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon spat out with a rare expression of suppressing anger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If it’s such an embarrassing name, you shouldn’t have given it one.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s not embarrassing, it’s…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Won Ha-ri disappeared forever without hearing this interesting story.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon confirmed that Won Ha-ri had left and showed a momentary look of relief, then left me there alone and exited.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The glimpse I caught of his earlobe was red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m truly Hunter School’s greatest delinquent. I chased everyone away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri returned after break time. The next class was archery, so we moved to the archery range.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The current training ground is a space that excludes natural wind, and wind will be factored in during advanced courses.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As befitting what could be called Korea’s Hogwarts, a spacious area spread out before our eyes as we entered the room. There were about five or six targets on the opposite side of the door.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon we received curved bows that looked like they came from a historical drama and magic quivers that produced infinite arrows. The bow had a sight attached, probably for beginners.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My bow was just big but incredibly light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The actual power is less than even a toy bow. If you shoot with this weight.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the AI advised that I should fill it with earth attribute.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Finally I can breathe a little.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was excited because above all, this was training I could do while standing still. Won Ha-ri seemed to be watching me subtly, as if she had decided to beat me in every field.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But unexpected situations occurred after learning the basic stance and shooting the first arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thwack—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sound of the arrow hitting the target was refreshing. Though the target was close, I scored 9 points.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one field where I was uniquely superior to Won Ha-ri had been discovered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri’s eyes changed. She suddenly began focusing fiercely on the target with the intensity of someone about to shoot a person’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Won Ha-ri, please don’t shoot me just because I’m doing too well.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri ground her teeth and shot another arrow. However, her score was lower than the previous one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This damn archery range, despite not being a bowling alley, recorded the players’ scores one by one above the targets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Lane 1: 7 7 8 9 8]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Lane 2: 9 10 9 10]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With me having one arrow left, Won Ha-ri bit her lips and glared at me fiercely. Were we having a score competition?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Well then, I should meet expectations and shoot well until the end.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if I shot just 3 points I’d win, but for sportsmanship, I sincerely nocked an arrow to the bowstring.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Looking carefully at the line on the floor while standing, my face turned diagonally toward the target.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment I fixed my focus on the distance—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My entire field of vision shook with dizziness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the sudden condition, I clenched my molars and simultaneously the bowstring launched the arrow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thunk!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My queasy vision soon returned to normal. I could see the score of the arrow stuck in the target.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [1 point]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  39 points versus 39 points. It was a tie.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri looked back at me with blazing eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why did you go easy on me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I blankly touched my forehead and blinked, then quickly changed my expression under Won Ha-ri’s gaze. With an annoying face, I gave the wink I hadn’t managed to give earlier.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Because I’m older?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ugh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fortunately Won Ha-ri didn’t notice and scrunched up her face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The training after that—honestly, my body suddenly drooped so much I don’t even know how I did it. Anyway, time passed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s how I finished my first successor training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I’m tired. It’s because this is the first time I’ve trained for so long.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s because my body suddenly changed to earth attribute and I can’t adapt. It’s like jet lag.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I forced away the anxious feeling. I skipped dinner because I was sleepy. I roughly drank some powdered grain mixed with milk and went to bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even inside the blanket I was a bit cold, so I raised the room temperature.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Late at night, Ja Hyeong-woo suddenly woke up from sleep with a chilling sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Something was calling him. That sound, inaudible to the ears, flowed in through the brain waves in his head, through his soul, through the power of water flowing in his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Familiar?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo just threw a black durumagi over his t-shirt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He teleported in the direction where he felt the energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as he arrived in a room with a familiar scent, he furrowed his brow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The room is too hot.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The air was muggy. It was a temperature that would make you sweat immediately. If someone had been sleeping here, they would have been drenched in sweat, right? Ja Hyeong-woo looked down at the bed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon, in the middle of this hot room, he felt a spine-chilling sensation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon lying still looked somehow stiff.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like a corpse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he touched him, he was really cold. Above all, his breathing was too shallow. Ja Hyeong-woo turned pale and called Gang-hyeon’s name while patting his shoulder.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gyeon Gang-hyeon! Gang-hyeon!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was symptoms similar to hypothermia, but the cause was unknown. Ja Hyeong-woo’s hands filled with blue light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s not working.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it were due to injury, his healing should work, but it doesn’t. Is it an energy problem?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Call Hae Mi-jun…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at the same time, he was certain that wouldn’t be the answer either. Remembering how Hae Mi-jun’s skills hadn’t worked after the gate incident.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He also realized that now was an extension of that time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even so, he had to do something. Ja Hyeong-woo took off his outer garment and approached closely, just like giving first aid to someone whose body temperature dropped from drowning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was about to embrace the ice-cold thin body to give it warmth—.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Healing is useless. I tried it too.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A strangely churning voice spread around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo finally faced the entity that had called him here.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was neither the form of a small mouse nor the form of a gloomy ghost. The mouse familiar had taken the form of another of its appearances—a young boy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The familiar, whose features and entire body were blurry, was sitting by the bedside, offering his knees to Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From the mouse familiar, who had become free after the pact with Gang-hyeon was broken but secretly remained nearby instead of returning to his master—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The same killing intent as before could not be felt.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If the previous familiar had been a spirit that could see nothing but its master like an evil ghost, now it was in a state of harboring a softened energy as if it had been purified.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I hoped that my master would not take a liking to this guy.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boy muttered without intonation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a voice without emotion, as if mentioning past events, things that had already happened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Thinking that this guy will continue to make my master shed tears.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the silence, only the clock hands moved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Breathing even fainter than the sound of the clock’s second hand was leaking from the person the two entities were looking down at.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon the mouse familiar raised his head and Ja Hyeong-woo followed suit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The boy looked at him one last time as if testing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Do you want to save him?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of nodding yes to those words, a mumble flowed from Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You know something, don’t you? About Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
