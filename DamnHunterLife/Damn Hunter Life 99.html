  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 99
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ma Cheon-ah must have realized from last time too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That if she proposes some half-hearted penalty to me, she’ll end up being the one to suffer instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then if Ma Cheon-ah brings a really ridiculous penalty… I can just smoothly back out saying I don’t want to do it. A scoundrel doesn’t need to have such principles, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Or maybe Ma Cheon-ah will just say she won’t make the bet at all.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Is giving me a penalty such an appealing merit to Ma Cheon-ah that it’s worth enduring the ‘humiliation’ of abandoning her so-desired 4-0 record and betting on a 6-4-2 record?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s eyebrows were raised upward as she fell into serious thought.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s just a bet, but what’s the big deal? It was obvious she was racking her brain as if she absolutely wouldn’t take a loss.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘She said “Only 4:0!” but the bet victory conditions are reversed, so she must be troubled?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, winning the bet isn’t important. My goal is to make her surprisingly easily accept it when the 4:0 gets broken by a round loss during the actual match.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the best scheme I could pull against that heaven-and-earth-defying, lone-wolf, bright 18-year-old.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho whined through chat asking to be included too. I raised my middle finger to send a polite refusal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was extremely satisfied. Since Sa Ye-ho happened to be in the same direction as Woo Sae-geon, Woo Sae-geon also saw my finger. It would have been nice if Ja Hyeong-woo was on that side too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah made her decision.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Alright, let’s bet.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She even accepted the reversed score without any objection.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She was being too compliant, so I had to wonder. What exactly was she thinking for the penalty?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Challenge dance.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The loser films and shares a trending dance challenge.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah had the look of someone who really wanted to dunk a person. If it’s a dance penalty…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I briefly thought of my sickly, stick-thin body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘You thought hard about this, Ma Cheon-ah.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I raised the corner of my mouth and responded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Fine, deal.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then Cheon-ah, let’s bet too!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho grinned and stubbornly intruded. “If I win, Gang-hyeon shares the dance video with me, and if you win, I’ll dance instead of you…” but then made eye contact with Woo Sae-geon and for some reason clamped his mouth shut.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Got it, I won’t interfere…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the commotion, I let my guard down. I carelessly turned my head and made direct eye contact with Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In that brief moment, the movement of Ja Hyeong-woo’s lips slightly parting was slowly etched into my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My body instinctively shuddered. A hot, embarrassing sensation surged up from within.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For an instant, over those Hwarang clothes, the image of Ja Hyeong-woo undressed flashed by—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I took out a water bottle from my inventory and splashed water all over my face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gasp! Why is he doing that?!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah looked at me like I was crazy, but the effect was tremendous. The heat rising to my face disappeared instantly. I vigorously wiped the moisture with my sleeve.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Please just forget it. Don’t think about it at all. Don’t even think about not thinking about it!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only after my mind became tattered did the movement signal from the American officials finally arrive.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [The Ox Successor (Leader) has requested gate movement.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Approved.]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Under the pretext of quickly returning Korean hunters, the opening ceremony for the match was omitted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The venue for the match wasn’t an actual region in America but an otherworldly space close to gates, and it was a special situation in various ways.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘We didn’t take a plane so there’s no private jet, no grand welcome events or performances. What will America do to show sincerity to their guests?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was worried we’d just get our feelings hurt and come back. Would my scoundrel nature work even on a hunter superpower like America…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While I was pondering, the changed surrounding scenery suddenly caught my eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah let out a light exclamation. Sa Ye-ho also made an “oh” sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All the buildings were designed in the form of traditional Joseon houses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The main gate, which seemed to be modeled after Gwanghwamun, had roses and hibiscus planted in equal portions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if Korea, not America, was the host country.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Woo Sae-geon had an expression of understanding without saying much, that said it all. (Woo Sae-geon probably knows more intimate details too. Like the invitation fees America paid to Korean hunters.)
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s an honor to meet you like this, Hunters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this time, an American official approached to greet us. There was also an interpreter beside him. From their energy, both were hunters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This person is wood attribute, the interpreter is earth… From how weak their energy is, they’re probably D-C rank. Since hunters of this level are common in America, I guess they do side jobs like this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I was startled alone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I can see foreign awakeners’ energy too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering we have to compete from now on, this was a tremendous advantage. Being able to see energy means I can grasp the flow of opponents’ attacks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If only I had the dynamic vision and reflexes to follow enemy team movements…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Ox Successor: Gang-hyeon, can you read these hunters’ abilities too?
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon seemed to notice these were hunters too. What a ghost-like person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He showed the skill of listening to the official’s words with the interpreter while simultaneously chatting with me behind the scenes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After the official welcomed us by mentioning each of our names, he said American personnel were waiting at the dining table and led us along a well-polished stone path.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  We were being treated hospitably, but we were essentially in enemy territory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So we absolutely only conversed through chat.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: While eating, check out the American kids’ characteristics to help with the game
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: And don’t show the chat when we enter the restaurant
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho’s words were important advice. This dining occasion itself was the only opportunity to scout the unfamiliar enemy team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The match scenes appeared in the original too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, unlike gates where monsters and routes are all predetermined, matches are fought against people so there are many variables. I couldn’t blindly trust the original’s information.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So first I needed to see if the 5 hunters on the opposing team were the same 5 from the original.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Upon entering a palace-like large hanok, a spacious table was spread out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The young men of foreign appearance who were already seated at the table each stood up as soon as they saw us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hello! I’m ‘Bootsman,’ captain of America’s first Hunter Olympics team ‘First Call.'”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, my eyes very quickly scanned each one of them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —Bootsman. Water-type healer. A hunter ranked in the top 10 healers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since Bootsman recognized leader Woo Sae-geon and aimed precisely at him to request a handshake, Woo Sae-geon reluctantly accepted the handshake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Successor Woo Sae-geon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon followed selective Korean sentiment. He would only speak honest Korean, but following American culture that lacks honorifics, he spoke informally to someone in their 30s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I didn’t expect you to come personally. I’m happy to meet the world rank 4, Korea rank 1 hunter in person.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I noticed the tendons in Woo Sae-geon’s wrist holding Bootsman’s hand were slightly raised.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Though he seemed to try not to show it, I could see Bootsman’s complexion faintly worsening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What if they complain that their healer’s arm got broken?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Does Woo Sae-geon think all healers are built like Ja Hyeong-woo?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Welcome! My nickname is Buster.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Next was an earth-type defender. In Korean terms, a tanker.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —A human shield as hard to penetrate as his size suggests. A fighter type who fights with his body rather than handling weapons.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The massive muscular body of a Westerner that looked like three of me combined was the first thing that caught my eye.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I really wanted to meet you all!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even while saying this, Buster’s gaze only lingered on Woo Sae-geon’s dangling hat string beads.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He probably wasn’t looking because it was pretty… He was definitely conscious of Woo Sae-geon from their first meeting. It was the same in the original.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because he really wants to compete with the world’s number one defender.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The next hunter was, as I remembered, the person who stood up last from the table.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Nickname Quiche, plant-type mage.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after finishing his brief self-introduction, Quiche kept glancing at the table. The book he’d been covering when we entered seemed to keep lingering before his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiche didn’t particularly look suited for combat. With a slender body like mine, bookworm-like glasses, and long straight blonde hair.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Still, I shouldn’t let my guard down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —A hunter who plays a role similar to Myo Cho-hui. Unlike his scholarly impression, he’s quite a serious competitor in battle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And there was also a female hunter who looked to be in her teens. Matched against Ma Cheon-ah, the only woman among us.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good afternoon. I’m Clyte, a swordsman.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  —A metal-type swordsman. Obviously an opponent who could match Ma Cheon-ah.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And when it came time for the last hunter’s introduction… I hesitated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Agni, it’s your turn.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A man as tall as Yang Pyo, with a face and distinctive green eyes that were unparalleled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hmm… Actually, I had doubts about whether we really needed to introduce ourselves like this. Because we already know each other, right? We must have investigated the enemy team.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Agni!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had never seen this man in the original.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Why did it change?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But thinking about it, our side was also quite different from the original. According to the original, Yang Pyo should have come to this place, but Gang-hyeon came instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So did the American team also change one person accordingly?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite Bootsman’s reproach, Agni seemed rather unwilling to introduce himself, acting indifferent. While playing dumb like that—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he made eye contact with me, he suddenly winked at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you okay being here? I think you should be in a hospital. Lying in bed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
