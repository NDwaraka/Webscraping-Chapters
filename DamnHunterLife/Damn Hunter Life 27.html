</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Right.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Ja Hyeong-woo left, I finally organized the situation while buried in my blanket.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I awakened, didn’t I?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s still the early part of the original work, but I ended up awakening this early.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head naturally started aching, so I closed my eyes. Successor training, stage conquest feedback meetings, interviews—all the things that would come rushing at me from now on came to mind one after another.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The path of hardship has opened wide.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was an awakening I was going to do anyway, but still, it would have been nice if I had awakened a few months later.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This is all because of that damn original work. Since I’ve already been severely betrayed once, I shouldn’t trust the dates mentioned in the original anymore. I’ll have to live always thinking about dealing with crises.
 </span>

  “Ah, get lost! My body’s already not well and now I’m getting lectured too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, I have at least a small bit of conscience, so I’ll train and enter stages… and if necessary, I’m willing to run external gates too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Come to think of it, now that I’ve finally awakened after all these twists and turns, does that mean my body will get healthier?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Didn’t they say the original Gang-hyeon was this weak because his qi was blocked wrong due to not awakening?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then now that everything has returned to normal, I should become at least as sturdy as a regular person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With hopeful expectations, I quickly got down from the bed. However, the moment I stepped on the ground, my ankle felt like pudding and twisted so sharply I almost got a fracture.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…My body just hasn’t recovered its strength yet. Yeah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I ordered two servings of cafeteria food to my residence and slowly pondered the future direction. As always, with my original work notes spread out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘And before that…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even for me, this matter required mental preparation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my phone, went to an internet portal site, and checked the outcome of the major accident I had caused.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But before I could properly look at the site, something caught my eye. There was one email.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sender was Association Manager Park Yoon-seok. The content was within the expected range.
 </span>

  By the way, what you did that day was truly magnificent.

  What’s with that last comment? Is he buttering me up in advance?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Considering the influence of Twelve Zodiac successors in South Korea, it wouldn’t have been excessive to imagine that all sites would still be plastered with articles about my awakening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So I carefully searched for my name in the news article list…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There were fewer articles with my name than I thought. There weren’t many Busan Gate articles either, and instead other topics were neatly filling the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  &lt;Monkey Successor’s Name and Age First Revealed… Her Joining Comments That Raise Future Expectations&gt;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Monkey successor Won Ha-ri.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A character who appears in the episode following the Busan Gate in the original work. Originally, she should have entered Hunter School this summer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Right. Since the Busan Gate was moved up, Won Ha-ri’s awakening timing would inevitably be earlier than in the original too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For several months, people had been enjoying chewing up and tearing apart Gyeon Gang-hyeon in community comments, but when that scoundrel awakened and put them in an awkward position, the internet communities immediately turned their heads to the new face young successor who appeared just in time…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In just a few days, my achievements were buried.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Buried! Yes!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I clenched my fists and cheered loudly. There had never been a happier day than today.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ha-ri! I don’t know you, but you’re the first successor as lovely as you!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I started coughing and sat back down in my chair, coughing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Wasn’t the earth attribute’s inherent physical characteristic ‘sturdiness’? I thought at least my body would improve once I awakened, but what’s this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since we’re on the topic, I should check what was added to the status window. Actually, I was confused about whether I had really awakened. Because my physical condition is like this.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The attribute automatically changed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart felt satisfied. Most of all, I was glad that even though the status window was newly reorganized, the existing semi-awakened skill remained the same.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then, what about the original water attribute?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Squeaky.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was quiet. Even when I shook the back of my hand where the mouse seal had been imprinted, I didn’t feel any sensation like dipping my hand in cool water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Squeaky?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did he run away while I was sleeping? Well, he should have gone to Ja Hyeong-woo long ago.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m not disappointed, but it’s a bit unsettling now that he’s gone. His healing ability was useful.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘No. Once I adapt to the earth attribute, my body will get stronger too. Then I won’t need it. It was originally Ja Hyeong-woo’s anyway.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Why worry about someone who’s already gone? I just continued looking around the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The skill I used in front of the gate…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the time, I had just seen the two characters ‘attack’ and recklessly drove it into the boss monster’s head. It’s amazing I didn’t die that day.
 </span>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Successor skill names are usually created with keywords related to the person themselves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I know about other successors’ skills from seeing the original work, but since Gang-hyeon is a character who died in the original, this is the first time I’m seeing this skill list too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It would be a better name than ominous nonsense like ‘Boundary Between Life and Death’, right?

  While seriously considering whether to sprinkle salt on the status window, I thought about what would happen next.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Until now I had just been messing around for points, but now I thought I could properly do awakened-specific training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course it would be tougher, and attribute training would be included too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘But wait? Then me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Two successors who happened to awaken around the same time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The AI instructor at Hunter School probably wouldn’t bother separating these two, would they?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Will I be receiving joint training with Won Ha-ri?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A successor training ground that looks like a physical education gym but built in traditional Korean style, giving it the feel of some martial arts master’s training hall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I set foot there for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I wandered around the corridors for no reason, even going far from the place originally marked as my destination on the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This place is very spacious compared to the number of people using it, so if you put your mind to it, you could avoid meeting anyone during training.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘They’re all determined.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Far from a welcome, the corridors were completely empty without even an ant.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could clearly see what stance the successors led by Woo Sae-geon wanted to take toward the scoundrel successor who came after awakening now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because in the original work, several people came out to greet Won Ha-ri and escort her.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after awakening, this is just the beginning.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While thinking that, I casually turned around, and behind a corner someone was hiding with just the top of their head sticking out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I saw everything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t hair but Hae Mi-jun’s head feather decoration. Hearing my voice, Hae Mi-jun peeked his head out a bit more.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His eyes were teary. I could see right through him. Even though his mouth was tightly shut, he was practically speaking with his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Can’t I go next to you?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I said no, it wouldn’t be strange if he burst into tears right away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon must have already warned him not to get close to me, but for that good kid to still act like this, I have to acknowledge his spirit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Anyway, the relationship between me and Hae Mi-jun was probably exposed enough in front of the gate.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah, come here.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s face brightened.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Twelve Zodiac’s second healer, whom I had once encouraged, came to stand in front of me with confident steps, no longer intimidated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Since we won’t be doing secret training just the two of us anymore, there won’t be much time to see you, hyung.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What can I do about you getting so good that you don’t need my help?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know why Hae Mi-jun looks at me with such trusting eyes just because I helped him out a bit back then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s disappointing that we can’t do joint training because our fields are different. I’m a healer and Gang-hyeon hyung is a dealer… ah, you’re a tanker.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun clapped his hand over his mouth as if that was some big slip of the tongue.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing his round eyes, my mischievous side kicked in as always.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Do I look like I can’t be a tanker? Like I’d fly to the opposite side if I got hit once?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No! No, ugh…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not knowing what to do and turning red, Hae Mi-jun eventually muttered “I’m sorry…” and lowered his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This guy is really consistent. He has no wit to get through situations by being cheeky, and no tricks at all…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unconsciously, my hand went up. I pushed aside the feather decoration and patted Hae Mi-jun’s head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun flinched and then opened his mouth to look up at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You treated me when I was hurt, right? And you caught me when I collapsed in front of the gate too. Thank you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His open mouth got even bigger. He looked so stupid I couldn’t help but chuckle.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stop goofing off and go inside.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He probably snuck out briefly while with Ja Hyeong-woo. Hae Mi-jun stood there dazed for a while longer, and only seemed to come to his senses when I turned around first. Hae Mi-jun shouted loudly at my back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His voice seemed to tremble slightly for some reason.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll really train hard! So that I can treat Gang-hyeon hyung anytime you’re hurt…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It’s a bit embarrassing to be seen as an intensive care target by the kid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What more are you going to work hard at from where you are?”
