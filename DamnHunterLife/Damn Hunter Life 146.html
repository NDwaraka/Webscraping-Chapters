  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 146
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m going crazy from embarrassment. No, I’m already crazy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when that bastard tried to rub his lips against mine, I didn’t stop him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I closed my eyelids, the sound of my own panting and Ja Hyeong-woo’s occasional rough breathing became clearer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was obvious that it wasn’t from being breathless, but from excitement. Feeling deep sexual desire from the touching mucous membranes, Gyeon Gang-hyeon shuddered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When I moved my legs slightly, my skin touched the thick thighs that trapped me. I was shocked at how thick and muscled they were.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like a beast pouncing on prey, he occupied the top position, moving his large shoulders and chest while pretending to be human. Unable to handle the tingling stimulation, when Gang-hyeon scratched at the cloth on his chest, Ja Hyeong-woo slyly caught that hand and interlaced their fingers.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I wasn’t asking you to hold my hand……!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The momentary irritation was soon scattered by the tingling sensation that flowed down his spine.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Smack, slurp, wet sounds rang chaotically in his ears. That bastard continued sucking on his mouth in a trance. He pressed firmly inside his mouth and greedily devoured his saliva. Since Gang-hyeon wasn’t stopping him, he was having a field day.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Does this bastard think I taste good?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sarcasm was only momentary. Even while grumbling, his body was following along. He readily accepted the saliva flowing from Ja Hyeong-woo like sweet nectar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He never thought he’d have his first kiss like this, pinned down and being devoured so harshly. Of course, he also never thought the other person would be like this……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So that Gang-hyeon wouldn’t suffocate to death, Ja Hyeong-woo skillfully continued the kiss while appropriately creating gaps to breathe. He didn’t know how many times this flesh had tangled and separated. It felt like the stimulation that penetrated his whole body was soaking his head until it was mushy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon thought with his mind half gone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There had been no women in Ja Hyeong-woo’s life. Naturally, he hadn’t met any men either. But why? Why was he so good at this?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when it came to Gang-hyeon specifically, he had no choice but to be skillfully good at it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ……Because he knew exactly where he reacted even while sleeping.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blood that seemed like it couldn’t rise any higher rushed to Gang-hyeon’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Just how many times, how much did he do!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to bite his tongue once, but far from that, he kept letting Ja Hyeong-woo hear his moans. He was gasping and being swept along as he was sucked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo pulled out his tongue and gave Gang-hyeon time to breathe.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Breathe deeply.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hah, hah…… Only then did wet breath spread completely into the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon blankly kept his focus above while his chest heaved. He could see Ja Hyeong-woo’s bangs were slightly damp with sweat. And the gaze pouring down on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Does it feel good? Are you excited?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was able to excite you. Ja Hyeong-woo let out a long breath filled with satisfaction into the sweet mucous membranes pressed together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dizziness that had been ringing below his navel receded and shame raised its head sharply. As soon as Gang-hyeon somewhat caught his breath, he launched a spiteful surprise attack.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He twisted his body greatly and pulled his lips away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he even used an earth attribute skill, his strength momentarily increased. Ja Hyeong-woo, who hadn’t prepared in advance, was pushed toward the sofa’s backrest. Thump, the sofa shook greatly and Ja Hyeong-woo’s back slid down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought Gang-hyeon would shake him off and leave just like that……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You crazy bastard, hah, babbling with that loose mouth?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A white face glaring fiercely was right above.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes grew even blacker when he realized Gang-hyeon had climbed on top of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The front of his loose hanbok pants was pulled taut and the surface was dampened. Gang-hyeon didn’t know that either. Because he was holding his body up with his knees on either side of the floor so his lower body wouldn’t touch.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even after occupying the top position as he wanted, somehow it wasn’t the picture Gang-hyeon had imagined. He had tried to trap him in his arms like Ja Hyeong-woo had done, but whether it was the difference in build, it felt more like lying on top of Ja Hyeong-woo’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he actually lifted his hips, he briefly thought it looked like a dog on all fours……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You used a skill just now. Right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s lowered voice seeped into his eardrums. Just hearing it made his whole body freeze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Then you need to receive yang energy again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Lust rippled in his black pupils. Their eyes met. A strange atmosphere flowed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While Gang-hyeon was off guard, Ja Hyeong-woo raised his neck and pulled the back of his head with one hand. Their lips touched again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Again……!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A moan burst out first at the tongue that came in along his palate and pressed his soft palate. His head naturally tilted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He mixed tongues with Ja Hyeong-woo again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, no thoughts came to mind. He just didn’t dislike it, and felt like he was being filled as terrible relief came flooding in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Mmph—.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s tongue touched deep places without tiring. Gang-hyeon’s arms buckled completely. He barely supported his body with his elbows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As a result, his knees slipped and his pubic bone came down onto the firm stomach.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes snapped open. Gang-hyeon also made a gasp and bolted upright, but it was too late.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon-ah.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Did I feel that right just now? The calling voice started with surprise and ended with excitement boiling over. Ja Hyeong-woo lowered his gaze to find Gang-hyeon’s center.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That area was slightly hotter than Ja Hyeong-woo’s body. And there was a bulging volume.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you hard?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At the explicit word, Gang-hyeon turned red up to his forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He quickly tried to get down from the sofa, but Ja Hyeong-woo’s arm caught his waist. Thanks to that, he was pressed down onto Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest, and his lower body was firmly pressed by the hand he extended.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s fingers groped his cock through the cloth. At the contact with clear intent, Gang-hyeon’s body jumped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A sharp sound from panic. Ja Hyeong-woo let out heated breath and smiled sweetly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stay still. I’ll make you feel good. I don’t know if I’ll be skilled enough to give you what I felt, but……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A hand slipped into the moist interior. Before Gang-hyeon could do anything about it, his cock was pulled out from inside his underwear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A hot palm swept down the sensitive surface and gripped the base firmly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah, ah…… huk!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A high moan rang through the living room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo touched and shook the cock that hung down below the slightly lowered pants, moving it up and down. When he rubbed the top part where the urethra was with his thumb, clear fluid came streaming out. It mixed with the sloshing sound of precum between palm and cock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Heu, hawook.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His vision flashed and his stomach and thighs trembled. Gang-hyeon’s arms kept trying to collapse from the pleasure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo chased after the lips that were red and swollen from panting. When he covered his mouth and inserted his tongue, the muffled moans became even more pitiful. The stimulation seemed too intense for him to even open his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who briefly separated their lips, whispered with feigned tenderness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Is the position hard? Want to go back down?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Contrary to his words, his hand never stopped, while persistently staring at the cock that was taut and ripe, dripping water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Would his past self from a few days ago have dared to imagine it? That a day would come when Gang-hyeon would be unable to move with such a lewd face, reaching climax in his hands.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon trembled and shuddered on top of Ja Hyeong-woo without the presence of mind to respond. He was like a person precariously riding a small boat in rough seas. Euhuk, heup, he only let out thin moans that even he couldn’t control.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unable to endure it, he would rub his cock against Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand, then suddenly stop responding and shake his head wildly. Despite intermittent efforts, the feeling of ejaculation kept rising.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly Gang-hyeon stiffened his body and struggled. He desperately put strength into the hand pressed against Ja Hyeong-woo’s chest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I, I think I’m going to come, wait—”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ja Hyeong-woo didn’t let him go.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He clearly observed the entire process. The perplexity in Gang-hyeon’s eyes, and the desperate desire just before ejaculation, and finally the despair born from shame.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Eventually white liquid burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s semen flowed down onto his body. Ja Hyeong-woo savored the terrible elation as if he had ejaculated himself, persistently kneading the cock until the end to squeeze out the semen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon’s face as he ejaculated while fully conscious—he would never forget it even in death.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who had been trembling, collapsed onto Ja Hyeong-woo, onto the semen he had spilled. Ja Hyeong-woo’s vision filled with straight-stretched side shoulders. The delicately trembling skin that twitched as if jumping hit his body directly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The panting breath was right next to his ear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Their gazes met sideways. Gang-hyeon was still teary-faced even though he hadn’t fully settled the afterglow of climax. The shame of having spilled something on Ja Hyeong-woo’s body while he watched was too great for him to collect himself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That face was both arousing and pitiful, so Ja Hyeong-woo spoke up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Can I do it too? If I dirty myself too, you won’t be the only one embarrassed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was quite a cunning proposal. If Gang-hyeon hadn’t been in a state where all his thinking was dulled like now, it wouldn’t have worked at all.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First of all, he wouldn’t be embarrassed by such things, and his own was already fully erect and needed to be relieved.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He had actually been worried the whole time that his pants might tear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The pleasure that had been almost painful finally seemed to be rewarded. He began shaking his cock after pulling it out to the side while Gang-hyeon was still on top of his body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Only then did Gang-hyeon look shocked, but he couldn’t get up right away because the feeling of weakness was greater. So he swayed along with Ja Hyeong-woo’s body movements.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While he pressed himself, the head occasionally brushed against Gang-hyeon’s thigh. Slippery fluid was smeared on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Did he masturbate often too?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before long, warm liquid poured onto his lower body. Gang-hyeon shuddered at the vivid sensation. Thick bodily fluid came out for quite a while and even pooled on the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had leaned his head back, let out a long breath through his mouth as if enjoying the feeling of ejaculation. Not even embarrassed, he left his just-ejaculated cock hanging out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a while, an awkward silence flowed with only Gang-hyeon feeling uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo quietly raised his hand and smoothly stroked Gang-hyeon’s swollen lips with the blue light gathered on his thumb.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……Put that thing away.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon resolutely looked straight ahead and didn’t move from on top until Ja Hyeong-woo finished adjusting his cock. He absolutely didn’t want to see that with his own eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The question of whether not seeing it now meant he could avoid seeing it in the future suddenly struck the back of his neck, but he just avoided it. He didn’t want to think about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  More than anything, he was too sleepy. The fatigue he had put off came all at once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While getting up, the sensation of slippery liquid flowing down his bare skin was chilling. Gang-hyeon just pulled up his wet pants and slowly came down. Without even turning his body toward Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His body could be washed, but what about the sofa.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t worry about it. I’ll buy you a new one. Go wash and sleep in bed. You’re tired.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Half-listening, Gang-hyeon looked at the clock.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This much time passed?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Both the minute and hour hands. The numbers they pointed to were completely different from what he remembered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon, who pressed his forehead in shock, glanced at Ja Hyeong-woo who was completely replacing the sofa with a new one using the shop function.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, if you’re done, go.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even at the tone that had turned cold again, Ja Hyeong-woo only hesitated slightly and wasn’t shaken.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  You felt good too. I know you’re like this partly because you’re embarrassed. Can I treat you like this from now on? Many words swirled inside, but the words he chose just before being kicked out were exactly two phrases among them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He slept sweetly, as deep as night sleep.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When he woke up, he was alone. A blanket pulled up to his neck, and only warm body temperature filled with yang energy remaining.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even though being alone was natural, it was quite a strange feeling.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before the drowsiness faded, the words he had heard earlier floated around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You can say anything to me from now on. But it has to be your true feelings. As long as it’s sincere, you can say anything.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “I’ll also speak honestly about everything. Let’s not hide things from each other anymore.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gang-hyeon tried to sit up, then squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep breath.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even then, he didn’t know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That Ja Hyeong-woo would really speak honestly about everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Did you sleep well?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When their eyes met, he smiled broadly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As if he had somehow unsealed himself…… or was that his imagination.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And this was in the middle of a training ground where all the other successors could see.
