  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 169
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There still aren’t any signs of something trying to attack me yet.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I examined the front and rear more closely while asking Myo Cho-hui if exploration skills were possible.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“No good. Something is blocking power like in illusion gates.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just like a stage with a thousand-year-old fox.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Team members scattered by the boss. In a situation where they don’t know their own location or others’ locations, they need to gather in one place.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At least it was fortunate that I alone didn’t get bounced to another place. I was still securing the stage entrance from where I originally was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘So I should gather them using myself as the reference point.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought of a good idea.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even someone as unusual as me can’t summon successors, but I can call familiars, right?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Everyone call out your familiars and get on top. I’m going to make them all return to where I am.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Going beyond controlling others’ familiars, it’s temporarily attributing them to me as if I were their owner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Have you ever seen a familiar look at maps to find their way back to their owner? Of course they return on their own.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When the explanation ended, the team members stirred once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Is that possible? Since when?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s possible.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because after nearly dying and coming back to life, all my abilities expanded beyond before.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I need to call six in total, right? After counting the order, I emanated energy from my body and shouted at the top of my lungs.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Squeaky! Hoppy! Draggy! Neighy! Monky! Piggy! Come back!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The result was success.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can feel the familiars moving from far away. At this rate, they’ll smoothly gather where I am.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But even though things are clearly going well, the communication is strangely buzzing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“The rabbit is Hoppy, and the horse goes neigh so it’s Neighy?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like no one except me liked the names.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At best, the sounds Jin Seol-woon, Hae Mi-jun, and Ja Hyeong-woo made were closer to just laughter than mockery…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m shocked right now.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Be honest. How many seconds did it take you to think up those names?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah and Won Ha-ri spoke up. Jeers poured from the two, but I didn’t yield.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s wrong with them? Aren’t they cute?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“They’re cute.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a comment Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been keeping his mouth shut, tossed out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A brief silence flowed. The atmosphere suddenly became strange.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In my flustered state, I said “Those kinds of names are cute? What’s wrong with your sense?” to recover.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway, I waited for the familiars to arrive in the forest that had become a complete mess from Won Ha-ri’s rampage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Not even a few minutes passed before a bright blue form burst out from between the trees. I doubted my eyes the moment I saw it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The mouse arrived first…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse is the smallest among the Twelve Zodiac familiars, so it can’t carry Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  So the best Ja Hyeong-woo could do was run following the mouse familiar as it rushed toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why I thought their joining would be the latest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But unexpectedly, even while the mouse rubbed its head against me, Ja Hyeong-woo was nowhere to be seen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Crazy bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse successor: Hey you idiot, you’re isolated there
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse successor&gt;Me: I can’t because I’m anxious. Send me back when all the other kids have joined up.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse successor&gt;Me: Especially it has to be after Mi-jun joins you.
 </b>
</p>
<p>

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He can’t stand the situation of me not having a healer beside me. This is maddening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Mouse successor: What are you going to do there alone!
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Mouse successor&gt;Me: It’s okay. I’ll be careful. Thanks for worrying.

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even during this, the mouse was showing me all kinds of affection.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Isn’t this character collapse…? The image of the proud blue boy crumbles more and more in my mind day by day. I wonder if that was all a dream.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Are you being affectionate because your body is far away? Why are you acting so unlike yourself.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I rubbed the mouse’s head with my hand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  How long was I doing that? Suddenly, the mouse turned its back and blocked in front of me. It bristled its fur while fiercely spewing water energy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t waver. I silently nocked an arrow to my bow and drew the string. I aimed in the direction the mouse was looking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The string trembled at my fingertips as if ready to spring out at any moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A pure white fox was among the trees. The blue energy it emitted was like poison.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I finally meet you, whom I’ve only heard about in stories.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A androgynous voice that was neither male nor female echoed in my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This boss monster also spoke to me. Moreover.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It heard a lot about me…?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My spine felt eerie. A vague fear struck me that something was happening somewhere I didn’t know about.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nine lush tails swayed from the fox’s body. The mouse trembled as it showed even more wariness, but the fox’s voice continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Humans called me by the lowly name Maegu, but in truth, a fox that has lived a thousand years is a god.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It had just spilled important information from its own mouth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘God, my ass. More important than that bullshit.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A god is ultimately a ghost too. This boss’s nature is spiritual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No different from the water ghost that stared at me, the fire ghost that avoided me, the boss that spoke to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fox’s bulging eyes stared at me. Feeling like I’d be sucked in, I put more strength into the hand holding the bow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Twang! I released the string pretending it was a mistake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, the arrow imbued with intermediate skills was lightly blocked. The arrow that had reached right before the fox’s nose fell powerlessly with a thud.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {You live up to your bewitching appearance. Isn’t the power you gained by offering your body to a healer troublesome?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The skin from the edge of my cheek began hardening stiffly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  To hear such insulting words right to my face, from a monster no less, not even a person.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Why do you maintain life so difficultly? You should have laid down your flesh long ago.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse’s body jumped. It was right before springing out. The will to try biting even if it, a healer’s familiar, died painfully was widespread.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I forcibly stretched my unmoving legs to block the mouse.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …Should I be thankful that it’s a ghost’s voice so others can’t hear it? I was alone anyway.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But then, someone walked out from behind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why should my leader have to hear such words? From a filthy monster?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned my head stiffly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was a bright red horse. Its mane made of sparks fluttered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah, who jumped down from the horse familiar, dragged her butcher knife across the ground with a scraping sound. The knife was soon lifted horizontally. She aimed at Maegu.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You… heard?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I hadn’t realized. That Maegu’s voice could be heard by someone other than me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My heart pounded as if a big secret had been discovered. Ma Cheon-ah glanced at me as she passed by. She stood protecting in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire attribute that handles mobility among the five attributes. Among them, Chollima is the fastest.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Excluding the mouse that wasn’t carrying its owner, the horse would have to arrive like lightning and stand at attention in front of me next.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fast enough for Ma Cheon-ah to interrupt the conversation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…How much did you hear?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As soon as another successor appeared, Maegu shut its mouth like a lie. The light in its eyes also disappeared, so now Maegu just looked like a wild beast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “The recently surging power was strange, but even without that power originally, a leader is a leader.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seems she heard everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But Ma Cheon-ah was calm. While it was unpleasant that she had an unsuitably serious face, heat rose to my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You suit each other. There’s nothing strange about it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My cheeks were on the verge of turning red. I barely managed to turn my chin away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Talk with me after the clearing ends.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “As you wish.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Signs that familiars carrying other successors were also gradually arriving could be seen. I buried what Maegu had said in the back of my mind and prepared for battle for now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The familiars arrived one after another. Especially when Won Ha-ri, the natural enemy of wood, arrived, we could capture Maegu—or god—without much difficulty.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It only had a big mouth, it wasn’t very strong.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just because it said meaningful things to confuse me and left me with annoying problems as a bonus.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Have I ever heard someone say I offered my body in my life? And where there were ears to hear it too.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After Stage 22 was safely completed, I ended up calling Ma Cheon-ah aside.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I explained what the thing about doing something with a healer meant, and how I was maintaining my body and living.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even for me, it was quite bewildering to confess to a woman, especially someone I’d fought and growled at like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after hearing everything, Ma Cheon-ah didn’t show any particular reaction. I thought she’d call me a pervert, or find me disgusting…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Well, that can happen. I’ll keep it secret.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead, only I was bewildered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even considering that she’d matured a bit, what is this matter-of-fact attitude?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was anxious because I couldn’t properly grasp Ma Cheon-ah’s thoughts. When I squinted and stared at her, she somehow took that and suddenly said:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you’re really anxious, want to trade for my secret?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then she started telling her own story without being asked.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
