<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo kept looking around the forest. He seemed reluctant to show his back to Agni and run like this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Should we just stop and catch him?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “No, forget it. How are we supposed to catch someone in the jungle? Just run faster.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Jungle? Is there a reason you’re specifically using English?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This is gaming terminology…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I got annoyed halfway through explaining and just let out a sigh with an exasperated expression. I hoped this would put Ja Hyeong-woo in a bad mood.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Anyway, whatever, he won’t attack anymore. How could he attack in this situation?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If I were alone, it would be a different story… but right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re with me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If Ja Hyeong-woo’s here, he’ll block bullets and heal me. He can’t send a teammate he just carried out back to the respawn point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With my words as the final say, Ja Hyeong-woo carried me on his back and ran again. Neither of us spoke until we arrived. Except for me nagging him to run faster.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It seemed like Ja Hyeong-woo was deliberately going slow.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The capture was right around the corner. The gauge had filled up to 94%.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If they won just one more engagement, it would be enough to fill it completely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only the healer hadn’t died at this crucial moment, the game would already be over!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah gritted her teeth but still retreated according to Woo Sae-geon’s instructions. FirstCall desperately pushed them out of the stronghold and all the way to the back road where the payload had come, as if this were their last chance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho noticed Ma Cheon-ah, who was gradually unable to bear being slowly pushed back and was on the verge of exploding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: Cheon-ah please don’t charge out please ㅈㅂㅈㅂ I’m begging you
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: If you go out and die the respawn will get messed up ㅠㅠ
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor: Let’s wait for the healer
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho made a reasonable judgment as a gamer, based on his experience built up from PC gaming.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if time was precious, it was safer to wait for the healer and attack the stronghold together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah knew this too. However, her competitive spirit that didn’t want to do that sprouted in her heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I just won’t die…! Those bastards keep pissing people off! How can I hold back?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unable to properly assess her own skills, she became increasingly clumsy with her sword as she rushed impatiently, and charged forward emotionally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after being caught off-guard by Clyte several times.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s insides turned gloomy with a sense of defeat. Like an addict who couldn’t give up despite taking heavy losses, she lost her judgment and understanding of the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Her grip tightened on the greatsword. Her legs too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as she was about to charge out alone at Buster, who was chasing them at a certain distance—
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But at that moment, someone poked Ma Cheon-ah in her head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With a small, pale face wearing a shameless smile.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Hold back, you fool. I’m holding back even though I’m getting beaten like a dog. Can’t you even hold back over something like that?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah had been the type to burst into tears from frustration since she was learning to walk, if her dad ran faster than her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For such a Ma Cheon-ah to kill her competitive emotions through willpower alone was impossible. Even more so because she was still young.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon understood Ma Cheon-ah’s tendencies better than anyone, through his personal knowledge of the original work and through direct experience meeting her.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And he came up with a method to control even someone like this right now.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If even a dog can hold back, why can’t I? I’m better than a dog!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If it was impossible to suppress her competitive spirit itself,
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The only way was to suppress it with another new competitive spirit.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s feet were used to retreat to a slightly safer place rather than charge forward.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, the long-awaited healer Ja Hyeong-woo appeared, carrying the not-particularly-awaited combatant Gyeon Gang-hyeon on his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Pffft! Hey, you two came like that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho burst out laughing as soon as he saw them, shaking his body back and forth with laughter. Gyeon Gang-hyeon jumped down from Ja Hyeong-woo’s back with a truly annoyed expression, his face slightly flushed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hyung!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho, who had been grinning, turned to look at Woo Sae-geon and shouted.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was already gone from that spot. Because he had charged toward the stronghold, toward the FirstCall group.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally, all five Successors had assembled. They bet the end of the 4th set on this assault.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clang—! Clyte’s Western-style sword clashed with Ma Cheon-ah’s curved butcher’s blade.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, the eyes of the two teenage girls met through the scattered fragments of clashing blade light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Clyte’s fair and square gaze mixed with Ma Cheon-ah’s burning competitive spirit. Ma Cheon-ah slowly came to a realization, as if responding.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘I just need to do my best right now, and enjoy both victory and defeat, right?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because neither victory nor defeat lasts forever.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah struck Clyte back hard. Clyte’s health bar dropped significantly. Ma Cheon-ah cheered internally.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time today, a smile appeared on Ma Cheon-ah’s face.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sense of defeat from the 3rd set. That disappeared thanks to the fun of competing with rivals ‘together’ with her teammates.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  She could enjoy it again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, Ma Cheon-ah didn’t realize that the catalyst for her change had come through the guidance of that person who growled whenever their eyes met.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Quiche, seeing Clyte half-collapsed, sensed the team’s crisis. He brought out the strongest skill among those he was allowed to use.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Vines covered entirely in sharp thorns grew abundantly from his feet. As if they were living beings with their own consciousness.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just as he was about to attack Ma Cheon-ah with those vines, a fierce wind rushed at him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For a moment, red hair doing aerial somersaults upside down in the sky brushed against his glasses.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「Ugh」!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thud thud thud! Three daggers thrown by Sa Ye-ho struck the vines in succession instead of Quiche’s body.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho flew through the air as if bouncing off, landing on the ground with a sliding screech.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Fire attribute versus plant attribute. At first glance, it seemed like fire that burns plants would have the advantage, but Sa Ye-ho used throwing knives. They were somewhat disadvantageous for cutting through thick plant stems.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, what had been blocking Sa Ye-ho’s solo performance so far was Quiche. Using plants to block or capture and restrain Sa Ye-ho, whose mobility was his lifeline.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho thought for a moment. All moments had been fun, but this was the most fun moment.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho swept his hair up with one hand and provoked Quiche with a flick of his index finger.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey you.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The thorny vines moved stealthily beneath Quiche’s calm expression.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Blue flames bloomed from the large needle Sa Ye-ho held up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Successors’ fight was more stable than ever. This was working. They had caught the flow. Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s eyes lit up at the atmosphere he could feel on his skin.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Finally wiping out FirstCall and at last standing at the stronghold,
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The gauge hit 100, and the victory emblem appeared before everyone’s eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The 4th set was the Successors’ victory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The elation carried over to the 5th set the next day. This time the Successors were the defending team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If they won just one more match, the game would end right there. When we win 4 matches, FirstCall would only have taken 1 victory.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Everyone thought it would end like that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If only they hadn’t been driven to the brink of losing the 5th set to FirstCall.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The flow was getting pretty intense.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  FirstCall splitting in half to push top and bottom lanes now was faster than when we pushed the entire bottom lane yesterday and started pushing the top lane.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The problem was that there were two payloads but only one Woo Sae-geon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And I was a sunfish who would die the moment I left the jungle without four people surrounding and protecting me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s practically not five people on the defending team, but four…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason I kept dying over and over again was this:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The defending team should be clinging to the attacking team, but I was being persistently hunted by Agni instead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My early kills were a source of laughter for our team too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  Horse Successor: How many dog deaths is that now

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Of course they’d laugh when the worthless weakling dies.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But laughing it off was only fine once or twice – as the same thing repeated, the atmosphere gradually became vicious. And gradually, everyone got swept up in that atmosphere.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Agni ▷ Gyeon Gang-hyeon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Agni ▷ Gyeon Gang-hyeon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s how much Agni made people fucking furious.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni crushed me into the dirt floor. A groan burst out from the pressure.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  On top of that, he instantly snatched away my bow. Before I could do anything about it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “「How are you going to attack now? Huh? Huh」?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni humiliated me, dangling the bow above me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He even stole my arrows and used them to repeatedly stab my chest, dealing damage. I gritted my teeth as I bled from my own weapon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey! You bastard!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah’s rage at Agni’s dirty play created an opening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That fucking…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even Sa Ye-ho’s concentration wavered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My health was already at rock bottom. When I judged I was about to die, I shouted loudly:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t look at me! Heal someone else!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I caught on that Ja Hyeong-woo was about to pour all his heals into me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni sometimes deliberately didn’t kill me and let me go. Then he’d hit me again from behind as I tried to crawl up, completely toying with me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The other four FirstCall members display good sportsmanship even while fighting.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing that even the FirstCall side sometimes looked fed up with Agni, he was definitely a troublemaker muddying his own team’s waters too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Nevertheless, they didn’t particularly stop Agni’s behavior. Agni was on the same team from the start, and what could they say when a teammate was killing the opposing team?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By the time FirstCall had pushed all the payloads and was attempting to capture the stronghold, I honestly admitted:
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘The flow is completely ruined.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Successors were all scattered because of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Except for the leader, of course. Even in this situation, Woo Sae-geon didn’t find any particular solution. He just focused on the fight in front of him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, Woo Sae-geon probably couldn’t think of anything either.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Fighting people instead of monsters isn’t Woo Sae-geon’s forte.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why he had subtly passed command to Sa Ye-ho, but that Sa Ye-ho also ended up getting angry and caught up in it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I had to take full responsibility and…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Come up with a move to reverse this flow.’
