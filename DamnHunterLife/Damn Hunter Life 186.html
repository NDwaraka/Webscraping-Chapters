  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 186
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My dog familiar, which had been my last remaining strength, gradually slowed down too. The horde of ghosts drew closer and closer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even at this moment, ghosts continued endlessly rising up. In the clearing that seemed almost infinite in size, that many ghosts had appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By now, such questions had become all too familiar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘What are those ghosts? Why are they so desperate to devour me?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But in this world I had possessed into in the first place, there wasn’t much I could know.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In a situation where I understood nothing, I strangely experienced my mind becoming clear.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then I saw a small light.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  What had been too small a dot to recognize at first gradually grew like a star as I approached it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Something occurred to me. But I don’t know what will change even if I know this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason spirit monsters only existed inside stages.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Stages are places we have to block, right? If we can’t block them, it means spirit monsters will spread out into the world.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then all these ghosts would spread out too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I didn’t check if Ja Hyeong-woo understood what I said. Instead, I opened the status window.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time in a long while, I read the original skill description as it was.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  &lt;Boundary Between Life and Death (No Attribute)&gt;
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Origin: The body that became incomplete as the energies of the Twelve Zodiac gathered came to straddle the boundary between the afterlife and this world.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Description: Temporarily cuts off vital signs and goes into hiding.
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The one and only ‘no attribute’ skill I possessed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I instantly modified this skill so it could be used on other beings besides myself.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A skill that cuts off vital signs. Though it’s a skill that brings living beings close to death, somehow the skill’s name meant both ‘life and death’ simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Then conversely, wouldn’t something work if I used it on dead beings too?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I moved below the dog familiar. I began using the skill one by one on the ghosts reaching out to me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The female ghost right in front of me disappeared. I eliminated them one by one with each skill use.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And hundreds and thousands of ghosts remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo called my name with difficulty, as if being strangled.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Throughout this stage, I had been cold to Ja Hyeong-woo until the very end.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just heal from behind. I might really become a ghost.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was something I said without much meaning, but at that moment my heart sank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘……Could Beom I-ryeong’s intention in approaching me have been……’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I gritted my teeth and forcibly stopped thinking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My hand using the colorless skill, and the ghosts falling away one by one.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who had been looking back and forth between both, embraced me from behind and emitted blue light. He increased the healing output.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon, stop…… Retreat leaving only me behind. Recover and come back……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His pleading voice cracked hideously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The mouse familiar had exhausted its strength long ago. Ja Hyeong-woo’s body was also driven to its limits. He was in a state where even the energy to preserve his own body was precious. It made sense, since he had remained until the very end even after all other team members had returned.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But more than all of that, my body, which wouldn’t stop using the Boundary Between Life and Death skill, was growing faint at an even faster rate.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I couldn’t hear my own voice. I could only feel Ja Hyeong-woo’s agonizing breathing and his trembling touch slowly groping over me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “How could I accept your words about trading your life to save me?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I could see he was on the verge of doing something I didn’t want.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I threatened him preemptively. When I harshly raised my voice, a cough mixed with blood burst out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you heal by cutting your lifespan, you’ll just die immediately. I’ll die as quickly as your lifespan decreases. Do you understand?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I’m saying, do you think I’d just stand by and watch you give up chunks of lifespan to break through skill limits like in the original work?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s eyes opened wide. Blood vessels tightened tensely within his eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t even ask me how I knew about that ability. Ja Hyeong-woo’s body, which had never trembled, shook pathetically. He showed without filter that he was afraid of losing me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even knowing this, I couldn’t bring myself to reassure him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slowly peeled off the ghosts clinging to the dog familiar’s rear. Blood seemed to be flowing from the corners of my mouth. Ja Hyeong-woo’s hand repeatedly felt around my lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Like sinking into water, Ja Hyeong-woo embraced me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If healing was cut off even slightly, my life would be extinguished.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had committed a sin against Korea’s number one healer that should never be committed again. I had placed too great a burden on him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My breath grew faint. All my senses gradually distanced themselves from me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Time slowed down, as if it would stop completely. Only the precarious silence just before fading away filled the air.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The reason my exhausted body from the long battle still wouldn’t let go of life was due to the duty to send back even one more ghost.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To where they should originally be.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I suddenly moved my mouth and exhaled. Fortunately, my voice flowed out.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon. Don’t speak.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I don’t know what state I was in, but Ja Hyeong-woo made me close my mouth while holding back tears slightly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But to avoid losing consciousness, I had to speak.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “These ghosts. Do you know what they really are?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It felt like a long-standing riddle was finally being solved. While using the Boundary Between Life and Death skill, I had gained insight into all of this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That everything surrounding me was actually connected as one. That it had guided me right to this point.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They’re real ghosts. They’re truly souls formed from the deaths of humans and monsters.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Stages were places close to being inexplicable mysteries. They were strange phenomena that occurred only in Korea, which even the system couldn’t predict.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gates within gates. Because Earth couldn’t handle this, the rules of the world gradually crumbled without our knowledge.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That’s why spirit monsters appeared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hunter School was a safety device prepared by the system to prevent the chaos that gates within gates would cause.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “We said that if we can’t close the stages, ghosts would be released into the world. So that means…… the afterlife and this world would be connected.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo had eyes that seemed to vaguely understand, but still looked confused. He looked at me with crinkled eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That makes sense. Including Ja Hyeong-woo, it was normal for no one to realize this simple truth.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But only I……
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Had encountered death up close, and this body I possessed had accumulated long suffering both before and after possession.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps this was why I was chosen as a no-attribute successor and ‘Hunter Who Achieves Harmony.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “……!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The dog familiar seemed to have collapsed and been reverse-summoned. My body rolled on the ground several times hazily.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A chin harboring hot body temperature embraced me and exhaled rough breaths.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, thrown down on the ground, tried to shield me and draw his sword.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I turned that Ja Hyeong-woo around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “It’s fine. I won.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I opened my eyes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo was looking around rather than at me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  All those ghosts had disappeared like a lie. It was the original empty clearing. The scene where Juk-yeop-gun corpses lay scattered.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hah……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I let out a long sigh and sprawled on the ground. I spread my limbs, not caring about getting covered in dust.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who blinked several times, made a strange expression that might have been laughter or tears. Then he toppled over beside me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo couldn’t get up for a while. I turned over to check on Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re all injured.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I told him not to cut his lifespan, so instead he seemed to have consumed his own blood and fluids. His dusky skin was pale and dry like sand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I took out an ion drink from my inventory and fed it to Ja Hyeong-woo. Ja Hyeong-woo frantically swallowed the liquid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo, who immediately sat up, wrapped his arms around me first.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Gang-hyeon……”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Don’t call me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was embarrassed, so I snapped at him harshly for now. Ja Hyeong-woo rubbed his lips against my forehead.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The status window blinked above my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  I quickly glared into the air. I pushed Ja Hyeong-woo away.

  The detestable bastard who only now appeared was spouting things I couldn’t understand.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I read the status window comments that only I could see aloud to Ja Hyeong-woo too. Since Ja Hyeong-woo now knew everything.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And hoping to sound threatening, I raised my eyes sharply.
 </span>
</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Irritation surged up. My blood pressure rose and I staggered for a moment, so Ja Hyeong-woo quickly embraced me.
