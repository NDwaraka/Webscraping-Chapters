  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 102
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The entire world seemed to shake with a *thud!* as dizziness struck me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Agni ▷ Gyeon Gang-hyeon]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was no longer in the open field. Along with the first death notification that appeared before me, I had moved to the spectator space.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It was a predictable ending, but…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Now that I was actually dead, my stomach felt a bit bitter. Especially Agni’s refreshed face that I couldn’t forget.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Meanwhile, the fight continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The American hunters who had taken out the weakest one first and instantly achieved numerical superiority.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni, who had killed me, next targeted Ja Hyeong-woo, who was both a healer and positioned close by. He was already distracted from defending because of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘In team battles, prioritizing taking out the enemy healer is standard.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In an instant, a non-combat healer was left one-on-one against an armed dealer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Bang bang*—! Bullets mercilessly slammed into Ja Hyeong-woo’s body. His body didn’t actually get pierced, but the recoil from the impact remained.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s health bar faintly turned red. *Crack*, the HP bar was shaved away from the right side as if being scraped by a knife.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  HP 66%
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprise spread across Agni’s expression. He seemed flustered by the fact that despite being a healer, Ja Hyeong-woo had more health than most combat personnel.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even after unleashing enough shots to turn someone into a honeycomb—the same shots that had eliminated me in one hit—it was only that much damage.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, Ja Hyeong-woo *thud!* suddenly kicked Agni’s leg in a surprise attack, securing distance.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A healer’s close-combat response—not a tanker, not a dealer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But that wasn’t all. Before long, blue talismans scrawled with Chinese characters began floating around him, flying toward Agni one after another like a shower of arrows.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ugh…!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps startled by Ja Hyeong-woo’s momentum, Agni seemed unable to recall that since this was a healer’s attack skill, it might not pose much threat when actually hit. Gunshots rang out in succession. The shooting to hit and knock down every talisman was urgent by the second.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  *Thud*, soon Agni leaped backward and landed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He realized that pushing Ja Hyeong-woo further would just waste bullets.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni quickly gave up on Ja Hyeong-woo. Only then, breaking away from his deep penetration into the enemy team’s formation, he turned around to see.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  His own side was also in chaos.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Woo Sae-geon ▷ Buster]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Buster had been delivering shock wave attacks with his shield. Woo Sae-geon had been crushing him relentlessly with dual swords.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In the end, the American tanker was pushed back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon struck down on Buster’s head with his dual swords and immediately moved forward. In his sight were the healer and mage remaining in the enemy team’s formation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Between the two, Woo Sae-geon first targeted the mage Quiche. Quiche had been supporting the team by stepping back and binding our team members’ ankles with saplings, or protecting Bootsman the healer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon lightly took a running start and *thud* leaped up. Quiche’s panicked gaze followed up to the sky where the saplings couldn’t reach, and then.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Woo Sae-geon ▷ Quiche]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Woo Sae-geon ▷ Bootsman]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Damn, he just bulldozed through them.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Kill notifications appeared in succession. That left only Clyte, who had been crossing swords with Ma Cheon-ah, and gunner Agni on their side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, now only Agni remained. Clyte had just been taken care of too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Ma Cheon-ah ▷ Clyte]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When Woo Sae-geon had killed Buster earlier, there was an indication that Sa Ye-ho had assisted, and this time it was Sa Ye-ho’s assist again. Sa Ye-ho’s movement speed was so fast that you’d suspect she had been in two places almost simultaneously.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho was lightning-quick and never stayed still for a moment, so even in the empty field, he wasn’t detected by the enemy team. When he threw several daggers to disrupt Clyte’s stance, the outcome was quickly decided (though Ma Cheon-ah would later be upset about interference in her one-on-one fight).
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  By the time the momentarily dazed Agni sensed movement behind him, it was too late. He had already exposed his back.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Behind Agni’s wide-open eyes, Sa Ye-ho appeared with his distant black hair and hanbok skirt fluttering, letting out a giggling sound.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Who do you think you are, going ‘bang~’ at our Gang-rat? Then I’ll go ‘pow~!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The bizarre final blow of jumping with both legs together while making a gun gesture with one hand. But the damage was solid.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Sa Ye-ho ▷ Agni]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The Successors had wiped out First Call while losing only me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This was the result of Set 1.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Before entering the next set, each team gathered in their waiting room.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That’s why I said from the beginning to just abandon me and go…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sitting alone on a chair, I muttered complaints quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The fact that I really was clumsy and beyond help was newly reinforced, bringing on a reality check.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If they hadn’t tried to take care of me from the start, it would have been more stable.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While grumbling, I told everyone the facts I’d learned about the opposing team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “They didn’t particularly focus on teamwork in the last round. It wasn’t so much that their coordination was poor, but rather they just played it casual. Partly to make us let our guard down too. Next round, they’ll definitely come out more systematically.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Somehow I felt Woo Sae-geon’s steady gaze.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Was it because I was using formal speech while briefing, being conscious of Woo Sae-geon? Or was the briefing itself annoying?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Anyway… the next round would definitely be tougher. Using this as grounds, I emphasized once more (especially while glaring at Ja Hyeong-woo) that I was unnecessary to the team.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What’s the point of trying to keep a weakling like me alive? It’s not like my damage output is killer either. I can’t use fusion skills and such since they’re all advanced skills.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In matches, usable skills were limited to basic level. Therefore, light attribute attacks or Ja Hyeong-woo’s basic healing were the permitted range.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course, this was also a welcome rule for us who needed to save skills for the Stages, which were our main job, but…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Then I really become useless.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unexpectedly, Ma Cheon-ah was the first to object.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But giving up after just one round looks even more pathetic! We need to show that we can win even with the penalty of being dogs!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Really, what do we do about this narcissism… You don’t even remember making that score bet earlier, do you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While glaring at Ma Cheon-ah for a moment, Sa Ye-ho also started chiming in from the side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why would we abandon you?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My face slowly turned toward Sa Ye-ho.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You think long-range dealers are common? Their gunner also has short range, so even combining our team and the enemy team, you’re practically the only long-range fighter. Do you know how well long-range dealers can break the flow when it matters?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was momentarily speechless at the serious persuasion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But when I met Sa Ye-ho’s extremely excited eyes, I suddenly felt deflated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You’re excited, you bastard.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Yeah. It’s so fun.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho had maximum job satisfaction. His already high energy had soared to the peak from the recent game. His cheeks and around his eyes were flushed red.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that moment, I secretly received a private message from the guy right in front of me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor&gt;Me: What’s wrong with you
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor&gt;Me: Where did your concept go

  Snake Successor&gt;Me: If you’re a delinquent, you should act up and try to run away

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …When did this bastard figure it out? That I sometimes deliberately get cursed at…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Me&gt;Snake Successor: Cunning bastard
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Snake Successor&gt;Me: Aww
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ==
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon, as Woo Sae-geon’s first voice was heard, all movements of me, Sa Ye-ho, and Ma Cheon-ah stopped abruptly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you just stay close to Ja Hyeong-woo, you’ll easily become a target, but others will only need to guard that one place where you two are. Isn’t that the only advantage? You can also provide covering fire for the enemy while protecting the healer. Why don’t you even think about what you can do and only try to throw in the towel?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  My head ached from the leader making nothing but valid points. I kept my lips as they were and only frowned deeply.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yes, it was my fault a hundred times over. It was obvious to anyone. Ja Hyeong-woo had caught me well, but I had kicked him away.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Woo Sae-geon seemed to have seen what I did in that brief moment, but I should be grateful that he didn’t ask for reasons.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But still, I have my own terrible circumstances too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘It’s practically going to be a back hug with Ja Hyeong-woo! For the entire 10 minutes of Set 2!’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I had barely managed to make eye contact with Ja Hyeong-woo, but I still couldn’t escape the burning embarrassment. I was desperately wanting to beat myself to death when.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Give me one more chance.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo’s words turned me around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Facing me with a somewhat bewildered expression, Ja Hyeong-woo put strength into his gaze. There wasn’t a trace of mockery in it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If I can’t keep you alive this time either, you can do whatever you want in Set 3.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This bastard, don’t tell me…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He thinks I died because of him?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Well, it’s not surprising. The original protagonist’s sense of duty as a healer was extreme to the point of being fanatical.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even with Gyeon Gang-hyeon dead and gone, that sense of responsibility remained intact, serving as motivation for his actions.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But why isn’t he using that sense of responsibility for team efficiency and instead exercising it in the wrong place?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  …The reason is.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because I’m Gyeon Gang-hyeon…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While heading back to the main arena for Set 2, I felt the edges of my cheeks growing warm. It was extremely uncomfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Toot
  </span>
 </i>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ! As soon as the starting horn sounded, I resigned myself and stayed still.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Don’t push him away. Don’t kick him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The sacrifice I could make for the team wasn’t anything else but this.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Dying early and lying comfortably in the waiting room was actually something for my own sake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ja Hyeong-woo ran over and reached me again. His arm wrapped around my waist once.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Agni, who had been coming to take me out first as if it were natural, hesitated when he saw me merged with the healer.
 </span>
