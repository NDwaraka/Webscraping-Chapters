  Damn Hunter Life Chapter 82
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This 9th talk show had two new successors joining, so instead of extending the talk time, they excluded the game corner.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This caused the writers to revolt. Of course, there was no actual uprising, just resigned complaints.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Just let them play games…! Games are at least fun and give us something to edit…!”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  However, when main PD Hong Jeong-hyeok delivered the 9th talk show material, the writers’ anguish lessened a bit. They calmed down somewhat and whispered among themselves.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Past photos. This should give us some subtitle material to edit…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The notes also included photo copies attached. The writers immediately put their heads together and started creating the show’s framework.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thinking that Sa Ye-ho’s photo would be last since the bigger reveals came later in the order, they were surprised to find that PD Hong Jeong-hyeok had marked Ja Hyeong-woo’s photo as the final highlight.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh, could this be Gyeon Gang-hyeon successor…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Seems like it, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow, this is big. If the reaction comes out well…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Time passed and the 9th filming day arrived.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Won Ha-ri successor on screen rushed straight to Ma Cheon-ah as soon as she entered the studio.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The faces of those watching the screen melted sweetly. The female cast members were precious children who naturally brought out chemistry, which was one less worry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The key concern was Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Since the PD and writers were only watching through screens without audio transmission, their faces and voices weren’t delivered to that side. They freely exchanged impressions while watching the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “That person has some camera presence.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He needs to have back-and-forth with other successors. Does Gyeon Gang-hyeon successor have anyone he’s close with? He’s probably a discarded card even among fellow successors.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Even if he awakened, would he have the will to do broadcasting? He’s the one who cursed at reporters and killed all hunter broadcasts…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was talk about him being childhood friends with Ja Hyeong-woo successor, but they had no expectations for that chemistry to show in the talk show. Those two are childhood friends? Then they’d just sit there scowling identically.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Listening to his team’s conversation, main PD Hong Jeong-hyeok also seriously watched the screen.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He continued observing Gyeon Gang-hyeon looking around the studio.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘He’s hesitating about where to sit. Looks like he’s trying to sit at the end?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just when he thought there wasn’t much more to see…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As Sa Ye-ho entered the filming location, their expressions changed considerably.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Gang-hyeon, you sit next to Seol-woon!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho put his arm around Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s shoulder. Gyeon Gang-hyeon also relaxed his body comfortably.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They looked so familiar, as if such skinship was natural between them. At that moment, both their faces appeared side by side in one frame.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The PDs’ pupils dilated as they instinctively recognized the visual.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Their art styles are similar.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. Both have that dark aura…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “This one feels pure while that one feels sharp?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Despite having a bad reputation, Gyeon Gang-hyeon sat next to Jin Seol-woon, a famous idol. Yet once again, their facial chemistry overcame concerns.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “These two feel so different that it’s also…”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Moreover, these two also exchanged light greetings, and the atmosphere wasn’t bad. Prince-like Jin Seol-woon, with that Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hong Jeong-hyeok grew increasingly confused.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Is there… no seat?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon after, Hae Mi-jun, the former youngest, came and sat in the opposite side seat. His face turned bashfully red with a shy light when facing Gyeon Gang-hyeon.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun’s cute handsome mask finally showed its true value now in the 9th filming. One PD sighed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ah, that’s exactly what I wanted from Hae Mi-jun successor… and it comes out when looking at Gyeon Gang-hyeon successor.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  They even got to see Ja Hyeong-woo look somewhere other than empty space for the first time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  That somewhere was Gyeon Gang-hyeon. This didn’t change even when recording started and the host began the opening.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Is he planning to keep staring like that?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A junior PD subtly asked if they shouldn’t make him look away. Hong Jeong-hyeok shook his head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Let’s leave it for now. We can edit it out later if needed.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The talk proceeded according to the prepared format. While Won Ha-ri clearly showed nervousness during introductions, Gyeon Gang-hyeon looked at the camera with composure. That seemed arrogant yet on the other hand…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘His mask is too good.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At first glance similar to the cunning Sa Ye-ho, yet creating a different character. That Gyeon Gang-hyeon who they thought would ruin the broadcast.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Anyone but Gang-hyeon oppa would be fine.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’m just everyone’s punching bag.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Perhaps to recover from his bad past image, he seemed to willingly take on a slightly self-deprecating character.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  With over half the successors able to exchange banter with him, his talk share matched Sa Ye-ho’s.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The junior staff seemed to sense the same thing as Hong Jeong-hyeok. They whispered admiringly without hiding it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “He’s good at this.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Finally there’s a cast member who can handle all of Sa Ye-ho successor’s jokes… I’m so moved.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The team members who had been lukewarm when first gathering in front of the recording screen were now all focused on Gyeon Gang-hyeon on screen. They all hoped for one thing with one heart.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘At the end, just react well to the past photo. Then we can acknowledge him.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And it hit the mark.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Aaaaah!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The chair was roughly pushed back. The remote camera properly captured Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s scream. Even the detailed movements of his abundantly moving facial muscles.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The expression came out perfectly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The moment Ja Hyeong-woo, usually suffering from comment drought, testified that the photo was from his own drawer, Hong Jeong-hyeok struck his knee with his fist.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gratefully, the successors chattered noisily on their own. Even when the audio got complex, it was just welcome.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Because as a PD, a truly editable highlight scene had emerged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“You hid this until now? You guys are amazing.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Why do you keep photos in your drawer? What’s your relationship!?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Shut up! Shut up! Ja Hyeong-woo, if you say one more word, I’ll kill you!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even the junior staff burst into genuine laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For the first time since taking on this program, Hong Jeong-hyeok felt rewarded by his work.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Although the major incident of school violence broke out afterward, preparations for &lt;The Heroes&gt; 10th episode proceeded smoothly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Again there was no game corner, but the writers weren’t anxious like before. They had somehow come to expect something from Gyeon Gang-hyeon successor. That he would create another topic of conversation this time too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Wow… this question is big. I’m already excited.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Woo Sae-geon successor didn’t cut this question? How unusual.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Right. Could it have looked interesting even to Woo Sae-geon successor…?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Come on, is he that type of person?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Washing powerless Gyeon Gang-hyeon
 </span>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
   Being washed by powerful Ja Hyeong-woo]
  </span>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The writers had already marked this question as an important scene in their notes. Even before filming started.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Something big is coming.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The host grinned and opened his mouth. Finally the long-awaited question emerged.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“This question is for males only!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The writers already started scribbling situational subtitles that came to mind on the spot in their notes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  In Hong Jeong-hyeok’s mind too, editing and effects perfect for the current situation unfolded smoothly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  First, he decided that no matter what, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s expression of shock with eyes popping out as soon as the question was thrown would definitely make it into the final product.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Narration: !]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Conversely, cross-editing with Ja Hyeong-woo’s equally speechless, victimized expression would be the icing on the cake.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Narration: 2 victims]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s embarrassed expression came out so well. Starting with that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Washing Gang-hyeon!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon turned to Sa Ye-ho with a face full of betrayal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The writers’ hands also got busy.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Gang-hyeon): What… what are you going to do]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Ye-ho): Like this whoosh and (?) swish swish and (?)]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Narration: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Host Bae Eun-soo had already prepared himself after seeing this question in today’s script.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He seemed to have put extra effort in, his attitude sharp and focused. Bae Eun-soo enthusiastically drew out each person’s answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Number… 1.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yang Pyo also didn’t agonize much.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Yang Pyo): No, honestly… washing hyung seems like it would be easy]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Gang-hyeon): Easy? Should I make it difficult for you?!]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Ye-ho): Difficult? Pyo, let’s wash together (?)]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Gang-hyeon): I’ll really kill…]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Yang Pyo): Does hyung weigh over 60kg?]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [Speech subtitle (Gang-hyeon): You don’t ask a man’s weight]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ma Cheon-ah and Won Ha-ri, who had been giggling, burst into laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The ripened atmosphere continued.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“I’ll do number 1.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who chose number 1 without hesitation with a smile on his lips as if it was fun, left everyone dumbfounded.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Indeed. Hong Jeong-hyeok had an intuition.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Unanimous decision, landslide victory vibes.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is the kind of question that easily becomes awkward if they’re not quite close, so I was actually considering a complete edit…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At this point, Hong Jeong-hyeok had to acknowledge it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon is completely a member of the Twelve Zodiac.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Also, Gyeon Gang-hyeon will be the key point that revives this dead broadcast!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“1… number 1…”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun was as embarrassed as if choosing someone to confess to between Gyeon Gang-hyeon and Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Would Woo Sae-geon successor give an answer?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“…1.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Surprisingly, even Woo Sae-geon responded. He contributed to the highlight scene!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He probably chose the lesser of two evils, but it was a sufficiently valuable statement. Waves of emotion crossed the PDs’ faces.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Sa Ye-ho successor did it…! Did he tell Woo Sae-geon to at least give one answer? It’s just a short reply, but how precious is this.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As the corner reached its climax, Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s facial expressions became art with each passing second.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The host went even further. Bae Eun-soo, who had been smiling slyly, expanded the situation.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ja Hyeong-woo successor! You weren’t chosen by anyone, what’s going on! Now, here comes the question! So then, what about you? Washing powerless Gyeon Gang-hyeon number 1, or powerful—”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Number 1.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sa Ye-ho threw his head back and roared with laughter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Among other sounds of people pressing fists to desks trying to hold back laughter, Gyeon Gang-hyeon was devastated.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The host finally threw the crowning question.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“So how about Gyeon Gang-hyeon successor? If you had to choose one?”]
