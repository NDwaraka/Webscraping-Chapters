  Me&gt;Dog Successor: You’re coming in the evening, right?

  Dog Successor&gt;Me: Going going

</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I can imagine Gyeon Gang-hyeon grumbling about how many times I’m asking. Jin Seol-woon smiled faintly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  There was one hour left until Gyeon Gang-hyeon came to his house. …Only one hour left.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He threw open the closet. He excluded the shirts he usually wore instead of hanbok from his options. Instead, he put on a white t-shirt and took out jeans that had only existed as decoration. He also took out an iron.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He applied hair serum to his hair that he had wetted and shaken out in the bathroom, and used only a hair dryer to lightly sweep about half his hair back. It was the skill of an idol who had to learn everything himself since not a single makeup team member could follow him to Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who had put down the hair dryer, hesitated in front of the cosmetics sitting on the vanity.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Tone correction and eye makeup used for schedules.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He wanted to apply everything, but if he did that, it might show even to Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s indifferent eyes. He reluctantly gave up, but eventually picked up lip balm to apply to his lips.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was someone who lacked lip color. And Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s lips were always rosy and moist even without applying anything. Every time he saw them, he often thought about wanting to touch them…
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Yesterday, when Gyeon Gang-hyeon returned late in the evening from his overseas expedition, Jin Seol-woon had done a face mask before sleeping. Plus, he polished his entire body with a morning bath. It was only after that that he asked Gyeon Gang-hyeon to have dinner together.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It wasn’t like he was taking him to a fancy restaurant, just eating school cafeteria food together, but just being alone together was a blessing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even if Gyeon Gang-hyeon was meeting various people and he had to wait his turn, it didn’t matter.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  No, it might matter a little.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After checking his appearance in the mirror several times, he continued looking around the house that was already clean with nothing more to tidy up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was about to organize even his bedroom when he suddenly let out a hollow laugh.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Show him the bedroom too? If I showed it to him, would Gang-hyeon-ssi actually come in?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  After ending his ridiculously over-the-top fuss, he sat at his desk this time.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Music that he had restarted from Gyeon Gang-hyeon’s encouragement. Not only had he not stopped singing, but he was also studying composition in his spare time. This summer too, he had made a song at Hunter School.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon chuckled as he skimmed through the lyrics he had written himself. The entire score looked like it had been soaked in sugar water.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  And this was after toning it down a lot. Another hollow laugh escaped.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He thought this kind of thing only happened to other people.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘If I played this for the members or the composer, they’d definitely ask if I have someone I like. Saying this isn’t your usual style.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Therefore, he decided not to let anyone hear this song. Except for one person, the only one person who could hear this song.
 </span>
</p>

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon, who checked the chat, put the sheet music in a drawer and stood up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He hadn’t prepared the meal yet. He wanted to prepare it together with Gyeon Gang-hyeon-ssi, and maybe brush fingertips while setting the tableware.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Tell me about the match.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Hey, don’t even mention it. It was fucking tough.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  From that kind of opening, it seemed like the timing to hurriedly lay out heroic tales while rushing to pick up chopsticks, but suddenly Gyeon Gang-hyeon stopped talking.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “But let me ask you one thing.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Gyeon Gang-hyeon stared intently at the homeowner sitting across from him at the dining table, the person with the most unrealistic appearance among people he knew.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  While thinking there’s no way a successful idol would backstab him, he still deliberately brought it up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “You don’t have any other feelings for me, right?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Instead of being flustered, Jin Seol-woon smiled. As if he found those words amusing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “What made you think that?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At that, Gyeon Gang-hyeon openly showed signs of relief, completely dropped his guard, and began chattering about the friendly match.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon listened to his chatter enjoyably throughout.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He never took out the acoustic guitar he had prepared.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  If he had honestly said he had other feelings there, Gyeon Gang-hyeon would never have come to Jin Seol-woon’s house again.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He did well to pretend not to know and make excuses in front of that question. That was right. Jin Seol-woon was very quick to catch on.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is really difficult. …To think I almost got rejected before even confessing.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon supported his chin with both hands while looking at the empty spot where Gyeon Gang-hyeon had left after finishing his meal.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was curious about what kind of person he was. What he used to do before, what his hobbies are now, even trivial things.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Even when he subtly asked in roundabout ways, he didn’t particularly reveal anything about himself. It didn’t feel like he had a past he didn’t want to remember… what could it be.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The worry was brief. Soon the flow in his mind changed. He recalled a scene from the friendly match video.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Oh? He’s doing a back hug? Successor Ja Hyeong-woo to Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon? The picture looks good? Is it weird to say this?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Oh my, he kicked him away! Was it an operation not agreed upon beforehand?”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ah! No! Clyte’s dagger! He needs to dodge! Ah, he couldn’t dodge!”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  [“Ah, the first death appears! Successor Gyeon Gang-hyeon should not avoid Successor Ja Hyeong-woo next time.”]
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The noisy commentary had been poking at Jin Seol-woon annoyingly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Ja Hyeong-woo-ssi’s existence bothers me.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was content you could immediately tell just by looking around the community a bit. The scenes people could see were limited, but Ja Hyeong-woo seemed to have absolutely no intention of hiding it.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">

  —Our healer really doesn’t give a single fuck about people’s gazes

 <span style="font-weight: 400">

 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘To Gang-hyeon-ssi, the community is like ‘Pandora’s box.’ It hasn’t opened yet because he has no intention of going in himself.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He was certain the two weren’t in any kind of relationship. But he also knew they weren’t just friends either. Some kind of male instinct perhaps.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Jin Seol-woon quickly drove away the dark thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  He didn’t know liking someone was like this. The same thrilling feeling as going on stage exists in just everyday moments. Emotions make a person float.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘This is why I can’t help but seriously devote myself to training… I was thinking of trying to create some common ground.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  * * *
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Hae Mi-jun and Jin Seol-woon. I discovered the fact that those two suspicious guys have no intentions toward me.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The anxiety symptoms I got because of Agni feel like they’re improving.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I returned home in a refreshed mood. I finished preparing for bed and flopped down.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Good night, guys.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I greeted my familiars and was about to pull up the covers when a warm furry bundle moved under my knees.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon a brown-haired head with faint features popped out from under the blanket. The puppy, who had wriggled into position, grabbed my arm.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I have something to say to Hyeon.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  For some reason, the puppy seemed extremely sulky. I went “Uh…” and sat up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I kept wanting to say it, but I waited until Hyeon’s match was over.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This little one waited without saying a word about being upset until I had some free time?
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Sometimes the familiars’ mental ages are unfathomable and give me chills.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought Squeaky was just a little kid who idolized his master, but he’s more level-headed than me. I thought the puppy was just a little kid too, but he has this thoughtful and mature side.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The puppy gripped my hand tightly. He muttered resolutely.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I want to stick to him and spy too. Send me.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Huh? To who? To do what?”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I asked what was going on in confusion.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Soon I could tell what the puppy had been building up about. The puppy whined and got annoyed.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Squeaky goes and tattles everything about Hyeon to him. That’s bad, isn’t it.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Ah, that.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Of course it doesn’t feel great, but that’s something I’m taking into consideration since I’m receiving help from Squeaky. So I could actually become calmer and persuade him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Ja Hyeong-woo is worried about me.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {No. He talks about stuff not related to your body too. About Hyeon going to other people’s houses and… and also, also…}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The puppy seemed to have more to say, with a resentful voice, but after a while, he shut his mouth going “mmph mmph” as if zipping it up.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘That’s probably also him checking my movements to see how tired I get. Or just monitoring whether I cause any trouble.’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I thought for a bit, then logically explained why the puppy couldn’t go to Ja Hyeong-woo.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “If you and Ja Hyeong-woo are together, it’s bad for Ja Hyeong-woo’s energy. Earth blocks water, you know. Ja Hyeong-woo would lose his strength.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  This applies to Squeaky too. In fact, having me attached to him would be uncomfortable for the water-attribute mouse familiar. But he stays attached thinking of me, I told him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  At those words, the puppy looked surprised. After a moment, he said in a dejected voice.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {I don’t really know what the mouse and he do to keep Hyeon from hurting. It’s hard for me to understand. I want to separate them from Hyeon, but I can’t. I’m scared. That Hyeon might die…}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Seeing the child who was just gripping my hand tightly and sniffling made my head go blank.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  As expected… my eyes feel stinging.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  It was like this when Won Ha-ri worried about me too. The feeling of watching Ja Hyeong-woo unable to leave my side is… similar.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Because it’s obvious he’d have a hard time if he knew I was in pain, so that’s why he tries to keep distance…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  A voice unconsciously crossed my mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Thump, my heart dropped. My fingertips went cold.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘…What was that just now?’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I shook my head and patted the puppy to comfort him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “Why would I die when I have you and Squeaky? I just need to endure for 3 years. When I retire and lose my strength, I’ll become fine again. Ah, when I retire, all the surveillance from Ja Hyeong-woo will end too.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  But suddenly, a certain fact hit the back of my head.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  When that time comes, I’ll have to part with the puppy too.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  ‘Someday we’ll have to part…’
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I was speechless with confusion. Just when I was shaken, the puppy read my thoughts.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {It’s okay. I was born knowing from the beginning. And even if I disappear, I’ll still be with Gang-hyeon, so it’s okay.}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The kid was actually calmer than me, which made me feel even more sorry.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  The puppy stroked my cheek and laid me down in place. Sleep came gently from the touch that made my body comfortable.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Just before falling completely asleep, the familiar who hugged me once asked quietly.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  {Hyeon doesn’t dislike him?}
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  Suddenly, I realized that the dog familiar didn’t directly call Ja Hyeong-woo by name.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I slowly pronounced that answer.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  “…I don’t really know. I don’t want to think deeply about it.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400">
  I really felt bad and closed my eyes.
 </span>
